<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention proceeds from a mast device for a submarine according to the introductory part of claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such a known mast device for submarines is provided such that at the upper end of the mast which is vertically traversable in a guiding means there is provided an information means which is in interactive connection with the control station in the inside of the submarine for receiving and emitting information. The information means is rigidly connected to the upper end of the mast and itself may be extended out by a certain amount so that it projects from the mast. If information is to be emitted and received, the submarine travels to the observation depth which corresponds to the height of the extended mast so that the information means is located above the water surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Furthermore it is known, e.g. by way of the DE patent document 758 461 and by way of DE 28 37 123 A1 to provide a buoyant unit in the form of a buoy which comprises an optical observation means. The buoy is releasably fastened to the body of the submarine, but via a cable which also transmits information signals to the command location, remains connected to this when the buoy is released from the submarine and on account of its intrinsic buoyancy has reached the surface of the water. The submarine is provided with a winch in order again to draw in the buoy after the end of its operation. The provision of an information buoy permits the submarine, in contrast to submarines with extending masts carrying information means, to assume a deeper observation depth position, in order to be able to carry out observations above the water surface. With these known buoy designs it is however disadvantageous that the main body of the submarine must additionally be specifically designed for the installation or accommodation of the buoyant buoy, which entails corresponding manufacturing costs and a larger space requirement. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention lies in further developing a mast device of the initially mentioned type such that in comparison to its extended condition, it permits a greater observation diving depth of the submarine for the information exchange above the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The solution of this object is specified in claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> By way of the inventive design of the mast device it is possible for the submarine to be able to assume such a i.e. deeper observation diving depth which is greater than that of the merely extended mast device. A further advantage lies in the fact that a separate buoyant information unit additional to the mast device is done away with, from which there leads the further advantage that no special space or place on or in the submarine need be provided for a floatable information unit and thus also the manufacturing costs for a separate information unit and the design of a space for its positioning in the retracted condition are done away with. A further advantage of the inventive mast device lies in the fact that its information unit may also be used in a conventional manner for emitting and/or receiving information above the water surface, i.e., that the mast is extended but that the buoyant unit with the information means remains on the upper end of the mast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In an advantageous embodiment of the inventive mast device the buoyant unit with the help of a seat formation in the upper mast region and with the help of the coupling medium is held secure in its position in the region of the upper end of the mast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further advantageous feature of the mast device lies in the fact that the mast upper end comprises a removable mast wall part for simplifying the release and repositioning of the buoyant unit from or on the mast upper end. Preferably the mast wall part is designed laterally pivotable, e.g. with the help of a piston-cylinder unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to a further advantageous feature the coupling means which connects the buoyant unit to the mast consists of a cable, e.g. a wire cable or a carbon fibre cable. The coupling means may also contain for example the electrical signal leads for the signal transmission. Furthermore the coupling means by way of the winch may be let out of the mast and pulled in again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further advantageous embodiment forms of the mast device according to the invention are specified in the dependent claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the mast device indicated generally at <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is vertically traversable in the conventional manner, a guide means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for the mast, a buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with conventional information means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for emitting and/or receiving information of all types above the surface of the water, a flexible coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, preferably in the form of a wire cable or a carbon fibre cable, with which there may be combined signal leads for electrical signals to and from the information means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as well as a winch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for letting out and again drawing in the coupling means, in order to let the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> rise to the surface of the water <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or to retract it again from this. The winch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may be provided outside the guiding means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, e.g. below next to it, or in the mast (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). The mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 a</cross-reference> hydrodynamic cross sectional profile and is vertically traversable in a conventional manner by way of a piston-cylinder unit (not shown), so that it may be extended out of the tower <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the submarine whose upper edge is indicated at <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The guiding means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is for example designed in the form of a shaft, which e.g. in the known manner may be manufactured of fibre composite material. The shaft-like guiding means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be reinforced with ribs <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The guide means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which alternatively may also be designed in the form of columns extends essentially up to the upper edge <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tower <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is completely retractable into the shaft-like guiding means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that it in this condition likewise does not project beyond the upper edge <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tower <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has an elongate floating body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which in the floating condition stands vertically, which effects a buoyancy force and which on its upper end comprises a platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which with the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> retracted closes the upper end of the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The information means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, for example radar means, radio means and/or optical means are accommodated in the known manner in a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which in the operational position of the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is located above the platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> passes through the platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> roughly in the middle and is rigidly connected to the float body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the case shown (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) the float body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is preferably separably connected to the platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. By way of this the float body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together with the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be completely retracted into the mast whilst the platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> separates from the float body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and remains in a seat surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the upper end of the mast and by way of this closes the mast upper end in a lid function. The platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thus comprises a passage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through which the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the information means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be moved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The vertical movement of the float body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> within the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is effected by way of a receiving means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which accommodates and grips the buoyant body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, wherein the receiving means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is vertically traversable by way of a piston-cylinder unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> with the arrow <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the float body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in cross section is designed hydrodynamically in order to achieve a steady floating position of the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> engages the floating body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at about half its height. The circumferential course <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is adapted to the flow profile of the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the region of the upper end of the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> there is provided a seat formation which apart from the seat surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> comprises two further seat surfaces <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in order to position the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> securely in the mast when it is retracted. In this condition it is held secure in position by way of the flexible coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the seat surfaces <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In order to simplify the release of the buoyant unit and thus its floating to the surface of the water <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the flexible coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is let out by way of the winch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, i.e. is let out of the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and in order to simplify the repositioning of the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the upper end of the mast when the coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is pulled in by way of the winch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a mast wall part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the upper end of the mast is designed removably replaceable again, preferably laterally pivotable, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> clearly shows. The lateral pivoting of the mast wall part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be effected by way of a piston cylinder unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The length of the pivotable mast wall part corresponds advantageously to the height of the float body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In cross section the mast wall part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> encompasses roughly half the periphery of the upper end of the mast as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> clearly shows. In the region of the remaining rigid part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the mast upper end there is provided a deflection roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for the bendable coupling part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. It can be understood that when the coupling part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is eased away the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be easily released from the seat surfaces <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and thus from the mast upper end when the mast wall part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pivoted away. Reversely the unit without difficulty may again be positioned on the end of the mast on the seat surfaces <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> when the coupling part is drawn in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> From the above description it results that the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is equipped with the usual information means for emitting and/or receiving information, is held free of connection on the mast upper end when it is located in the retracted condition. For raising the unit to the water surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> it is merely necessary to pivot away the mast wall part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and to let out the coupling part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. On account of its intrinsic buoyancy the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> then moves upwards to the surface of the water <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is let out of the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the desired observation depth for the submarine desired in each case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The mast device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be provided with a cut-off means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in order to be able to sever the coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in an emergency. In this case the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which has been let out and floats on the surface of the water <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> serves as an emergency buoy in order to draw attention to an emergency of the submarine. In the shown case the cut-off means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is provided outside the shaft-like guiding means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the winch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. However also other locations in the mast device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>show the retraction procedure for the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is located on the surface of the water <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. By way of actuation of the winch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> the cable-like coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and thus the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is retracted (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). After the coupling means has been retracted the mast wall part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pivoted onto the stationary mast upper end <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so that the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is seated on the upper end of the mast (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) without connection and in its correct position. Subsequently the float body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> carrying the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the information means is further retracted with the help of the receiving means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in a manner such that the housing no longer projects out of the platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). Finally the mast is hydraulically retracted into the shaft-like guiding means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that the mast no longer projects beyond the tower <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the submarine as can be clearly deduced from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. If the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is to reach the surface of the water <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, one proceeds in the reverse order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure that the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the water assumes a stabilised vertical attitude when the submarine is travelling during the emitting and/or receiving of information, the section <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the flexible coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, said section bordering the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, is provided with at least one buoyancy means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. This buoyancy means may consist of a hollow body or of a solid body of a buoyant material, e.g. foam. In place of a single buoyancy body <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which may have a certain distance to the float body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows, one may proceed in that the section <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided with a plurality of cylindrical or spherical buoyancy bodies which are centrally perforated and are set in row on the section <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Alternatively to this on the section <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>there may also be provided a rod-shaped buoyancy body with a central passage hole. Furthermore the design of the buoyancy body or bodies <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is carried out such that they may be retracted into the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> without trouble. The buoyancy force of each buoyancy body <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is set such that the section <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the coupling means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> assumes essentially a horizontal position when the submarine is travelling so that the floating unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> assumes a stabilised vertical position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment example of the mast device according to the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and is indicated generally at <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. This embodiment example is designed more simply than that of embodiment example 1. The buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as a whole has a cylindrical shape whose lower region is designed as a float body, whist its upper region is designed as a water-tight housing in which the previously mentioned information means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is contained. Furthermore in the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> there is provided a winch <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on which the flexible coupling part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is wound. Furthermore also in this case there is provided a cut-off device <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which is arranged in the mast <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the usual manner is vertically traversable in the shaft-like guiding means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by way of a piston cylinder unit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in a manner such that the mast may be extended up to its upper end position above the tower <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the submarine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the region of its upper end is designed with a tubular receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for the cylindrical, buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> there is shown an extending procedure for the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the mast device <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows the mast device <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> including its buoyant unit in the complete retracted condition. The mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and/or the floating unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> do not protrude upwards with respect to the upper edge <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tower. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the extended condition in a manner such that the upper end of the mast slightly projects beyond the surface of the water <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this position of the mast the buoyant unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is partly extended in a manner such that it with its lower end is still located in the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Also in this operational position of the unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> information may be emitted and received. The observation depth of the submarine is in this case determined essentially by the extended mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shows the case in which the submarine is located at a considerably deeper observation depth with respect to the case according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this case the coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is wound off further from the winch <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and projects out of the upper end of the mast <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the desired length, wherein the unit floats on the water surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in a vertical position. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>it becomes evident that the above described mast device may be used in the conventional operational position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and in an operational position with a considerably greater observation depth of the submarine (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). This both applies to the embodiment example 1 according to the FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In both embodiment examples 1 and 25 the coupling means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has a total length which essentially corresponds to the maximum desired observation depth of the submarine. </paragraph>
