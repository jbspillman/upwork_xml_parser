<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device for producing a neat edge for lawns, borders, garden paths and the like. More particularly, but not exclusively, it relates to a device to demarcate and support an edge of a lawn, and to a method for using such a device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Creating a lawn with a neat edge where it meets flower beds, borders, paths, ponds and the like can be difficult. There is a risk that the edge of the lawn may crumble, especially if the turf is not very well knitted together. If a damaged edge is trimmed back to shape, for example with a spade or an edging tool, the lawn inevitably shrinks and the bed, path, etc. widens. Damaged sections may even need to be removed and re-turfed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A particular problem may arise in the case of garden ponds, where the surrounding turf can easily be damaged or even undermined. Clods of soil falling into a pond can make the water unacceptably muddy, necessitating frequent cleaning. It is not always a satisfactory solution to pave the immediate surrounds of a pond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It would be helpful to provide a barrier to discourage the spread of grass from the lawn into beds, borders and paths, particularly when regular weeding would be inconvenient or impracticable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Simple lawn edging materials, such as vertically inserted ceramic tiles or metal strips, are well known. However, if the lawn is lower than the bed or vertical edge, mowing becomes difficult, and if only one side of the edging material is supported, such as where the lawn is higher than adjacent portions of a flower bed, or where the lawn borders on a pond, the edging material can easily fall over. It may be attached to posts, stakes and the like, extending deep into the ground, but these can be unsightly and are not compatible with waterproof membranes such as are used to line garden ponds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Substantial graveled areas are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to traditional grassed lawns. However, for graveled areas as well as grassed ones, a neat edge can be difficult to produce and maintain, particularly when the graveled area is higher than a neighboring area, and there is a risk of gravel falling or being kicked, say, into the neighboring area. There are hence problems with edging graveled areas akin to those with edging traditional grassed lawns, particularly when it is desired that a graveled area extends up to a pond. The term &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; as used herein should therefore be understood to refer to both traditional grassed lawns and to graveled garden areas, except where clearly restricted to one or the other by context. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a means to support and protect a periphery of a lawn, particularly adjacent a pond, bed or border, which obviates the above problems and permits the creation of a neat and durable edge to the lawn. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for protecting an edge of a lawn using such means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an edge support means for a margin of a lawn as defined herein, comprising an elongate generally L-shaped support member having a base part adapted to be fixable to ground beneath the lawn, and an upstanding wall part adapted to retain an edge of the lawn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The base part may be apertured, to allow grass root growth therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the base part comprises a lattice of strut means joining the wall part to an elongate member, optionally extending parallel to the wall part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The lattice may define a plurality of elongate apertures extending substantially between the wall part and the elongate member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Said elongate apertures may comprise at least one third of a total area of the base part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The elongate apertures may each extend transversely to the wall part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Each elongate aperture may have a smooth rounded periphery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The base part, preferably the elongate member, may be provided with anchoring means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The anchoring means may comprise peg means adapted to cooperate with apertures in or adjacent to the elongate member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The wall part may optionally extend downwardly from the plane of the base part so that the edge support has a T-shaped profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The elongate member may be provided with a plurality of severable zones, anyone of which may be cut or broken as required to permit alteration, at any desired point, of the alignment of the wall part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The wall part may thus be deformable, either convexly or concavely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The wall part may comprise zones of weakness, better to allow its bending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The edge support means may be provided with connection means to connect it to further edge support means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The wall part may be provided along its upper margin with strengthening means, such as a zone of increased thickness or a flange means, optionally a flange means extending towards the base part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The base part may be provided along its margin remote from the wall means with strengthening means, such as a zone of increased thickness or a flange means, optionally a flange means extending towards the wall part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The connection means may conveniently connect via flange means of adjoining edge support means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The edge support means may be provided adjacent a junction of the wall part and the base part with reinforcing means adapted to resist flexion of said junction, particularly bending of the wall part away from the base part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing means may comprise a simple reinforcing bead extending along the junction or more complex shapes, such as a C-shaped bead, disposed with a convex side towards said junction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The edge support means may comprise a plastics material, such as polyethylene, polypropylene or poly (vinyl chloride). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The edge support means may be provided with illumination means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The illumination means may comprise fiber-optic cable means operatively linked to a light source locatable remotely from the edge support means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The edge support means may comprise a fiber-optic cable element provided with means to connect it operatively to a fiber-optic cable element of adjoining edge support means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The edge support means may thus illuminate a margin of a lawn, path, pond or the like, for safety or for decorative purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of protecting an edge of a lawn which comprises the steps of providing an edge support means as described above, locating the base part thereof to a ground surface, and laying lawn material on top of the base part with an end of the lawn material abutting the wall part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When the lawn is a grassed lawn, the lawn material may comprise turf, which may be a freshly laid turf or alternatively may be a peripheral zone of an existing lawn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, where the lawn is a graveled area, the lawn material may be gravel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The method may comprise the step of removing existing turf or other lawn material from the lawn over at least an area corresponding to an extent of the base part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the method may comprise the step of peeling back existing turf from said area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The method may comprise the step of anchoring the edge support means to the ground using a peg means or other anchoring means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The method may further comprise the steps of providing a plurality of edge support means, and linking them in series, either before or after disposing them in position on the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> To protect an edge of a lawn adjacent a pond, the method may further comprise the steps of digging the pond and laying a waterproof lining means over a base of the pond and a surface of the ground surrounding the pond, and the base part of the or each edge support means is then disposed on top of said waterproof lining means, and the turf or other lawn material is laid on top of both the base part and the waterproof lining means.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, and to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in particular, an edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a lawn comprises a generally vertical, in use, wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a generally horizontal, in use, base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown, the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprise a single L-shaped molding of thermoplastics material, although in an alternative embodiment, the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are formed separately and fastened together. In other embodiments, the support may comprise other materials such as wood or metal, especially aluminum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprises an elongate strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a plurality of diagonal strips <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> connecting it to the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The diagonal strips <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> slant in alternately opposing directions to form a series of triangular apertures <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This configuration imparts excellent rigidity to the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, while saving raw materials and allowing grass roots to grow down through the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, helping to anchor it in place. The strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, spaced one from another, each configured to receive a peg (not shown in this view) to help to anchor the edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be used in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to support a straight lawn edge. To support a concave or convex lawn edge, the frame strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is severed along any or each of dotted lines <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may then be folded concavely or convexly. In the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, at the apex of each triangular space, a fold zone <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may optionally be provided to allow bending of the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, this may not be necessary, especially with lighter gauge material. The severed ends of the strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be overlapped where necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be grooved, notched or otherwise weakened along the dotted lines <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, to ease cutting. Similarly, each fold zone <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be grooved, notched or otherwise prepared for easy folding. However, in a preferred embodiment, both the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are composed of thermoplastics material of thickness two to three millimeters, which may be folded manually without especial preparation. Similarly, the strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may then be cut at any convenient point along its length with readily available tools, such as a knife, scissors, garden shears, secateurs or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In use, the edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is disposed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. When a grassed lawn is being laid from scratch, the edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed, with the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on a generally level surface, at a boundary between, for example, a flower bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is or will be lawn. A peg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inserted through each hole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A turf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is then laid on top of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, such that an end of the turf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is in contact with the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The remainder of the area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be turfed conventionally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> If a lawn is being grown from seed, soil is placed on top of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and in contact with the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may then be seeded conventionally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> If the edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is to be used to edge an existing grassed lawn, a turf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is either cut out of the existing area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, or a corresponding zone is undercut and peeled back. In either case, sufficient space is created to emplace the edge support as above, and the turf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is then replaced or folded back into position, as appropriate. Any gaps remaining between the turf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, due, for example, to previous damage to the edge of the lawn area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, can be filled with soil and reseeded, or plugged with small pieces of turf, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> thus creates a neat edge to the lawn, resistant to crumbling and other damage. The weight of the turf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the presence of the pegs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, keep the edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> securely in position. In a preferred embodiment, the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to be almost as high as a typical turf thickness (normally from twenty to twenty-five millimeters). The wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may thus conveniently be about 20 millimeters high. The lawn area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can then be mown right up to its edge, which is supported by the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, without the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being damaged by lawnmower blades, or vice versa. Edge trimming, with shears or a string trimmer, for example, may be unnecessary. Roots <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of grass plants <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> growing on the turf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (only some of which are shown, for clarity) may in time grow through the apertures <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, anchoring the edge support even more securely. In this connection, the apertures are shown as triangles. However, other shapes may be used, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In normal use, it is envisaged that the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> should extend perhaps 70 to 80 millimeters from the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to provide sufficient stability. In an alternative embodiment, larger edge supports <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be provided, with a turf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> already in situ thereon, for convenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Clearly, edge supports <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be provided with walls of a convenient length, and a number of walls may be connected, end-to-end, to provide a desired continuous length of wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Standard male-female engagement devices may be provided at each end of each length, and one embodiment of such a connector is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> For the edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be used adjacent a pond <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, there is a slight variation in the installation method. A pit is dug for the pond <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the pond <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is lined with a water impermeable membrane <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which is extended to underlie the area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is then placed on top of the membrane <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The pegs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are set far enough from the edge of the pond to be able to penetrate the membrane <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> without possibility of leakage. Such a perforation in a periphery of the membrane <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> would not cause the leakage problems that could result from the use of retaining stakes at a margin of the pond <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> itself. For a grassed lawn, the turf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may then be placed on top of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and in contact with the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A neat and secure edge can thus be provided for a pond in a lawn area, without recourse to concrete rims, paving slabs and the like. There will be very little tendency for soil to crumble into the pond, and the lawn can be mown up to its edge without its giving way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In this application of the edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a short downward extension <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, below the general level of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, may form a sideways &lsquo;T&rsquo; -shaped support. This is useful for cosmetic and other purposes, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be made of appropriately colored materials, such as green plastics material, and may have appropriate surface textures molded or embossed into a face of the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> exposed in use, to blend in with its surroundings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a plan of an edge support <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with an alternative configuration of base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprise a single L shaped extrusion of thermoplastics material. The base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of elongate apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which may be formed by stamping out portions of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (which is typically only two or three millimeters thick). Each end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the elongate apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rounded, conveniently being substantially semicircular. This shape reduces stresses in the material of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> around the elongate apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, compared to shapes with distinct corners, reducing accidental breakages. The elongate apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extend generally perpendicularly away from the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> towards an elongate strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> defining an edge of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> remote from the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, each configured to receive a peg, as for the edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> To support a concave or convex lawn edge, the elongate strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is severed along a line between its edge remote from the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an elongate aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may then be folded concavely or convexly, as for the edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, overlapping severed ends of the strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> where necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A plurality of narrow slots <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are also provided in the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, also with rounded ends <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The narrow slots <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> supplement the elongate apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, lightening the edge support <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> further, and providing additional routes through which grass roots may grow and engage with the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, anchoring the edge support <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is an unapertured sheet. Alternatively, the base <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be provided with slits or notches, extending from the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> towards an opposite margin of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, to facilitate bending of the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> show, in cross-section, edge supports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with strengthening elements. The wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of each edge support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has its upper rim <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> folded over. This strengthens the upper rim <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> without making the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> much more difficult to bend convexly or concavely, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of each edge support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided adjacent its edge remote from the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extending therefrom upwardly and slightly towards the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This strengthens the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and may engage with a turf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (not shown) placed thereon, helping to anchor the edge support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. It does not make the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> significantly more difficult to sever, where required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The folded upper rim <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are simple shapes to be formed in a continuous plastics extrusion (which may be cut into individual edge supports as required). The recesses <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> formed between the upper rim <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and between the flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively, providing convenient points of attachment for connecting elements <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to join adjacent edge supports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The edge support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is provided with a reinforcing element <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> with a C-shaped profile adjacent a junction of the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The edge support <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is instead provided with a reinforcing bead <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of generally quarter-circular profile along the junction. The reinforcing element <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the reinforcing bead <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> each strengthen the respective edge support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> against any tendency for the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be bent away from the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for example by someone treading on an edge of a lawn supported by the edge support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. The base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is apertured similarly to that of the preceding embodiment, but is additionally provided with zones of weakness <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, two of which lead from an edge of the base <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a converging angle across the frame strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to connect to the rounded end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of each aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, defining a removable panel <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of generally trapezoidal shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A cross section of such a zone of weakness <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. It may easily be fractured by manual pressure to remove the panel <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, allowing the support to be bent in either direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a support where all the panels <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> have been removed. Of course, it is not always necessary to remove every panel. Where the degree of curvature required is shallow, alternate panels <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be left in place, and where no curvature is required, all the panels <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in that section may remain unbroken. Essentially, any panel may be removed to allow curvature at that section of the edge support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> supporting an edge of a graveled &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> adjacent a flowerbed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is placed on a generally level surface, as for a grassed lawn, and a peg <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inserted through each hole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Gravel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is then poured on top of the base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and is retained by the wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, restraining it from spilling on to the flowerbed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this use, an apertured base member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is not required, as plant growth through the graveled &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is not desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> A graveled &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is frequently laid over a sheet <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of &ldquo;geotextile&rdquo;, which is permeable to moisture, but too finely apertured to allow shoots and roots therethrough. Geotextile may lift up at its edges, which is unsightly and allows weeds to grow. If an edge support <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed on top of the geotextile sheet <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and is pegged into place with the pegs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending through the sheet <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the sheet <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> can be neatly maintained in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> An edge support means as described above thus provides a convenient and reliable means of providing a neat and durable edge for a lawn, where it meets a flowering bed, a border or a pond. It can be used for straight, convex or concave edges with minimal adjustment. The lawn can be mown up to the edge with little risk of damage, and the lawn edge does not require frequent trimming, tidying and repair. The edge support can equally well be used to edge graveled garden areas as to edge traditional grassed lawns. </paragraph>
