<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> In this specification, the term &ldquo;lead&rdquo; is used to mean &ldquo;a conductor by which one circuit element is electrically connected to another,&rdquo; not the metal &ldquo;lead&rdquo; expressed by the symbol Pb. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical transmitter module, an optical receiver module, and an optical transceiver module that is constituted by combining the other two modules. In this specification, these three modules are generically referred to as optical communication modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a partially cutaway perspective view showing the cross-sectional structure of a laser diode transmitter currently in use. A laser diode (LD) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a monitor photodiode (M-PD) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which monitors the intensity of the light transmitted by the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, are placed in the package. Optical signals transmitted by the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> enter an optical fiber <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> through a lens <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Such an optical communication module is called a pigtail-type module because of its outward appearance. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20, a</cross-reference> pigtail-type module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> connected with a circuit substrate provided with a driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a C-R element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, requires the leads of the laser diode transmitter to be bent to solder them to the circuit substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Recent developments in optical communication technology requir smaller, less costly, and mass-producible optical communication apparatuses. In the conventional structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference>, the LD is produced separately from the circuit substrate provided with the driver IC and other related devices. This production method has unsatisfactory limitations in miniaturization, cost reduction, and mass production. The structure causes the connection between the LD and the circuit substrate to be performed solely by hand soldering. This connection method prevents the improvement in the production efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The major factor causing the laser diode transmitter and the circuit substrate to be produced separately from each other is that there is no satisfactory means for electrically connecting the LD and the circuit substrate in a limited space at the time of the integration of the LD and the circuit substrate. The laser diode transmitter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> allows no more than four leads to be connected. On the other hand, at least 8 leads (sometimes 14 leads or more) are required when the leads for the IC for driving the LD are included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another reason for the separate production is that there is no satisfactory means for providing concurrently electrical insulation and thermal insulation at the time of the integration of the LD and the circuit substrate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above-described problems, the principal object of the present invention is to offer an optical communication module that can be electrically connected in a limited space with the next-stage circuit substrate having a multitude of leads.

Yet another object is to offer a particular method of connecting the optical communication module with the next-stage circuit substrate.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The present invention accomplishes the above-described principal object by using multiple layers of electroconductive media. More specifically, an optical communication module of the present invention includes the following components: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> (a) multiple layers of electroconductive media each of which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> (a1) has a plurality of electroconductive pins; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> (a2) protrudes from the main body of the module; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> (b) at least one optoelectronic device selected from the group consisting of at least one light-emitting device and at least one light-receiving device, the optoelectronic device or each optoelectronic device being supported by one of the electroconductive media; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> (c) an optically coupling means coupled optically with the optoelectronic device or each optoelectronic device, the optoelectronic device or each optically coupling means being supported by one of the electroconductive media; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> (d) an electric-circuit part connected to the optoelectronic device or each optoelectronic device, the optoelectronic device or each electric-circuit part being supported by one of the electroconductive media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The module may also include a connector portion that; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> (a) is formed at the end portion of each of the electroconductive media; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (b) is to be connected to the next-stage circuit substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The multilayer structure of the electroconductive media enables the mounting of a multitude of optoelectronic devices and electric-circuit parts. (The conventional single-layer structure has difficulty in mounting a multitude of such components.) Because each of the electroconductive media itself forms a connector portion to be connected to the next-stage circuit substrate, the electrical connection between the optoelectronic devices and the next-stage circuit substrate having a multitude of leads can be performed in a small space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Considering the thermal insulation, the optoelectronic device and the electric-circuit part should be placed at a mutual distance of sufficient interval. However, the following more important requirement prevents such a spacious design. The increase in the transmission rate of signals requires the decrease in the impedance of the connecting circuits between the optoelectronic device and the electric-circuit part to enable the high-speed response. The impedance can be reduced by placing the two components at the shortest possible mutual distance. Therefore, the electric-circuit part is housed in a small package. This miniaturization, however, causes the conventional package to become short of lead pins for forming the interface with the outside circuit. In order to meet the mutually contradictory requirements, the present invention employs a multilayer structure of electroconductive media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> When a plurality of electroconductive media are layered, the electric-circuit part can be placed in close proximity to the optoelectronic device, while securing the number of circuits for the electrical connection with the next-stage circuit substrate. The layered structure of the electroconductive media enables ample provision of lead pins so that unconnected lead pins can be used for heat dissipation. The protruding direction of the lead pins of the electroconductive media can be determined without restriction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> A light-emitting device, a light-receiving device, and an electric-circuit part may be supported in combination by the same electroconductive medium or may be supported individually by a different electroconductive medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to use a metal lead frame as the electroconductive medium. There may be two or more lead frames. In addition, a plurality of light-emitting devices, light-receiving devices, and electric-circuit parts may be supported by the electroconductive media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The types of optical coupling means include an optical fiber. A ferruled optical fiber is ordinarily used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The types of optical communication modules include an optical transmitter module, an optical receiver module, and an optical transceiver module. A typical optical transmitter module comprises an LD as the light-emitting device and a driver IC for the LD as the electric-circuit part. The optical transmitter module may further comprise an M-PD, which monitors the intensity of the LD. A typical optical receiver module comprises a PD as the light-receiving device and an amplifier for amplifying the signal of the PD as the electric-circuit part. A typical optical transceiver module comprises at least one combination of a light-emitting device and a driver IC and at least one combination of a light-receiving device and an amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> A more specific structure of an optical transceiver module is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Its signal-transmitting portion comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> (a) an LD supported by a part of a first lead frame; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> (b) an optical fiber for transmitting signal, which is coupled optically with the LD; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> (c) a driver IC supported by a part of a second lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Its signal-receiving portion comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> (a) a PD supported by the remaining part of the first lead frame; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> (b) an optical fiber for receiving signal, which is coupled optically with the PD; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> (c) the PD&apos;s signal amplifier supported by the remaining part of the second lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> It is desirable that the signal-transmitting portion and the signal-receiving portion be resin-molded as a package and that the end portions of the lead frames protruding from the package be used as connector portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, at least one optoelectronic device selected from the group consisting of at least one light-emitting device and at least one light-receiving device and an electric-circuit part connected to the optoelectronic device or each optoelectronic device are supported by a plurality of electroconductive media either directly or indirectly through a material such as an Si platform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> A desirable specific structure is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> (a) A first electroconductive medium and a second electroconductive medium are layered through an electric insulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> (b) At least one of a light-emitting device and a light-receiving device is supported by the first electroconductive medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> (c) At least one electric-circuit part, such as a driver IC or an amplifier, is supported by the second electroconductive medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In this case, it is desirable that at least one of the light-emitting device and the light-receiving device be supported by the first electroconductive medium through an Si platform. Because Si has a superior heat conductive property, the heat generated by the light-emitting device and the light-receiving device can be effectively dissipated from the first electroconductive medium through the Si platform. In addition, the Si platform allows the easy formation of a V-shaped groove by etching for supporting an optical fiber. Consequently, an end of the optical fiber can be easily fixed on the Si platform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> It is desirable that an electric-circuit part be supported directly by a second electroconductive medium separated from a first electroconductive medium. This direct support enables the prompt dissipation of the heat generated by the electric-circuit part through the second electroconductive medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> It is desirable that an electric insulator placed between a first electroconductive medium and a second electroconductive medium have a thermally insulating property. In addition to the secure electrical insulation between the first and second electroconductive media by the electric insulator, the thermal insulation between the two media can also be secured by using a material having both electrically insulating and thermally insulating properties as the electric insulator. For example, when (a) at least one of a light-emitting device and a light-receiving device is supported by the first electroconductive medium, (b) at least one electric-circuit part is supported by the second electroconductive medium, and (c) an electrically and thermally insulating material is placed between the two electroconductive media, the flow of the heat generated by the electric-circuit or each electric-circuit part to the first electroconductive medium is suppressed by the electrically and thermally insulating material, inhibiting the flow of heat into the light-emitting device, the light-receiving device, or both, which are temperature-sensitive. As described above, the layering of the first and second electroconductive media secures the electrical and thermal insulation between the optoelectronic device and the electric-circuit part even though the two components are placed in close proximity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The direction of the protrusion of the first and second electroconductive media can be determined without restrictions. They may protrude in the same direction or in different directions. When the direction differs, it is desirable that the two electroconductive media protrude in a direction perpendicular to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The present invention also offers an optical communication module in which one optical fiber is used for both transmission and reception of signals. In this module, one optical fiber is coupled optically with a light-emitting device and a light-receiving device through an optical wavelength demultiplexer. This structure enables the signal transmission between the light-emitting device and the optical fiber and between the optical fiber and the light-receiving device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The connector portion is formed such that the next-stage circuit substrate is fitted between the two electroconductive media. The connection between the connector portion and the next-stage circuit substrate is performed by the reflow soldering method accompanied by infrared heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The connector portion of an optical communication module of the present invention is formed such that the internal distance between the opposing electroconductive media is slightly smaller than the thickness of the next-stage circuit substrate. This structure relies on the elasticity of the electroconductive media in preventing the easy displacement of the circuit substrate once the circuit substrate is inserted between the connector portions. In particular, when convex portions are formed at the inside of the opposing electroconductive media, the elasticity of the electroconductive media can easily be utilized. The convex portion can be formed either by bending the electroconductive medium itself to obtain a proper form or by attaching a small rounded piece of electroconductive material onto a straight electroconductive medium to form a projected part. In addition, when concave portions are formed at the contacting points of the next-stage circuit substrate such that the concave portions fit the convex portions of the connector portion, the reliability of the connection between the connector portion and the next-stage circuit substrate can be further heightened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to provide a guide structure that prevents the next-stage circuit substrate from shifting in a direction perpendicular to the protruding direction of the electroconductive media. When the connector portion has a structure in which the next-stage circuit substrate is inserted between the electroconductive media, the displacement of the circuit substrate in the protruding direction of the electroconductive media can be prevented. However, the circuit substrate can still shift in a direction perpendicular to the protruding direction of the electroconductive media. This movement can be prevented by the above-described guide structure. Therefore, the guide structure provides secure connection between the connector portion and the circuit substrate. More specifically, it is desirable to form a pair of guide grooves in a package of the optical communication module. An optical communication module usually has the structure of a package that encloses by resin-molding the light-emitting device, light-receiving device, electric-circuit parts, and optically coupling means. The electroconductive media protrude from the package to form the connector portion. When a pair of guide grooves are formed in the package such that the distance between the opposite innermost walls of the guide grooves corresponds to the width of the end portion of the circuit substrate, the guide grooves can prevent the movement of the circuit substrate in the lateral direction, a direction perpendicular to the protruding direction of the electroconductive media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the connection between an optical communication module and the next-stage circuit substrate is performed through the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> (a) a step for providing an optical communication module in which at least one optoelectronic device selected from the group consisting of at least one light-emitting device and at least one light-receiving device, an electric-circuit part connected to the optoelectronic device or each optoelectronic device, and an optically coupling means coupled optically with the or each optoelectronic device are supported by a plurality of layers of electroconductive media; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> (b) a step for forming solder bumps at the connecting portion of the next-stage circuit substrate to be connected with the optical communication module; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> (c) a step for fitting the connecting portion of the next-stage circuit substrate between the connector portions formed at the end portions of the electroconductive media; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> (d) a step for connecting the fitted portion by soldering accompanied by non-contact heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Employing the soldering method accompanied by non-contact heating, a connecting method of the present invention can further stabilize the heating temperature and time in the connection between the optical communication module and the next-stage circuit substrate in comparison with the conventional method. It is desirable to use the reflow soldering method as the soldering method accompanied by non-contact heating. It is desirable that the heating method for the soldering be the infrared heating method, the hot-air heating method, or the combination of these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The next-stage circuit substrate is provided in advance with solder bumps formed at the portion to be connected with the optical communication module. When paste-like cream solder is printed in place of the solder bumps for the connection with the connector portion of the optical communication module, the cream solder may spread while the next-stage circuit substrate is fitted between the connector portions. As a result, neighboring connecting points may be short-circuited. When the hand-soldering method is employed, it is difficult to maintain the constant amount of the solder supplied to the connecting places where minute pitches are required. On the other hand, the solder bumps are solidified before the next-stage circuit substrate is fitted between the connector portions. Therefore, no solder spreads. The solder-bump method is effective in preventing the short-circuiting. The use of a metal mask having a uniform thickness and openings can stabilize the amount of the supplied solder even with minute pitches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> It is desirable that the solder bumps be formed concurrently by the heat for soldering the specified electrical components onto the next-stage circuit substrate. More specifically, when cream solder is printed on the next-stage circuit substrate for mounting the electrical components, not only is the cream solder for the electrical components printed but also the cream solder for the portion for connecting with the optical communication module is printed. The subsequent heating for soldering the electrical components onto the next-stage circuit substrate concurrently forms the solder bumps at the connecting portion of the next-stage circuit substrate where no electrical components are mounted. The formation of the solder bumps by this method eliminates the solder-supplying operation at the time of the connection between the optical communication module and the next-stage circuit substrate. As a result, the step for the connection solely performs the heating of the solder, thereby increasing the efficiency of the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to test an optical communication module of the present invention by tentatively connecting it with a testing circuit substrate before completely connecting it with the next-stage circuit substrate. It is desirable that the testing circuit substrate have the same connection mechanism as that of the next-stage circuit substrate. Because the module can be disconnected from the testing circuit substrate, the modules can be tested in advance to eliminate defective modules so that only the satisfactory modules can be completely connected. Consequently, unproductive production steps can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to prepare an optical communication module provided with the structure of a package by resin-molding and to resin-encapsulate the exposed portions of the electroconductive media between the package and the next-stage circuit substrate. The connector portion at the end of each of the layered electroconductive media protrudes from the main body of the packaged module and is exposed. After the connection between the module and the next-stage circuit substrate, the exposed portions still remain at the outer surface and between the layers of the electroconductive media. In the present invention, the exposed portions are encapsulated by resin. This resin encapsulation facilitates the impedance matching between the packaged module and the next-stage circuit. As a result, the reflection of electric currents at the circuit boundaries is reduced and the combined structure becomes more suitable for high-speed operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate the foregoing impedance matching, it is desirable that the resin for the encapsulation have a dielectric constant comparable to that of the resin for the packaging of the module. In other words, it is desirable to use resin similar to the resin used for the packaging. More specifically, the resin for the encapsulation may have a dielectric constant being 80 to 120% of that of the resin for the packaging. For example, when epoxy resin (the dielectric constant is about 4.0) is used for the packaging, it is desirable to use, as the resin having a comparable dielectric constant, liquid crystal polymer resin (the dielectric constant is about 3.9, which is 97.5% of that of epoxy resin) or polyimide resin (the dielectric constant is about 3.5, which is 87.5% of that of epoxy resin). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The resin encapsulation may be applied only to the exposed portions of the electroconductive media. However, it is desirable that the resin encapsulation be performed so as to cover not only the exposed portions of the electroconductive media but also the connected portion between the package of the module and the next-stage circuit substrate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Optical Transmitter Module: Two Layers of Lead Frames </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> show an optical transmitter module of the present invention having two layers of lead frames. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a longitudinal cross section of the module. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a plan view of the module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> from which the driver IC and the second lead frame are removed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a plan view of the module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The optical transmitter module is equipped with an LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is a light-transmitting device, and a driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is an electric-circuit part for driving the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is supported by a first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (a first electroconductive medium) through an Si platform <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is supported directly by a second lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (a second electroconductive medium) that overlaps the first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. An insulating spacer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (an electrical insulator) is placed between the first and second lead frames. A shallow V-shaped groove and a deep V-shaped groove are continuously formed on the Si platform <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. An optical fiber <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is fitted in the shallow V-shaped groove and an optical fiber ferrule <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is fitted in the deep V-shaped groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> usually has temperature-sensitive properties. A typical LD has an active layer made of InGaAsP grown on an InP substrate. Therefore, it is desirable to minimize the heat from the driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, especially an IC made with Si or GaAs. On the other hand, the decrease in the distance between the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> enables faster operations. Consequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed on the first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed on the second lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Such an optical transmitter module can be produced by the process explained below. The two layers of the lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are placed at a specified mutual distance, in this case about one millimeter, using the insulating spacer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> made of a high-polymer insulating material having low thermal conductivity and good electrical insulation. It is desirable that the insulating spacer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> be made of a liquid crystal polymer and that the lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> be made of Fe, Cu, or Al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed on the Si platform <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which acts as both a heat sink and a submount. The Si platform <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a semiconductor and allows an electric current to flow. Therefore, its top surface and back surface are provided with insulating layers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> made of SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>formed by thermal oxidation or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The V-shaped grooves for fixing the optical fiber <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the optical fiber ferrule <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a metallized pattern for bonding the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are formed on the Si platform <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by photolithography. The optical fiber ferrule <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> supporting the optical fiber <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is made of zirconia or alumina. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the bonding using Au wires <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> performs the connection between the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and between the driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the end portion of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are enclosed with, for example, a transparent silicone-family resin by using the encapsulation method. The resin provides the refractive-index matching with the optical fiber <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the surface protection of the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the protection of the Au wires <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The outside shape of the module is formed by molding with epoxy resin the entire module except the end portions of the two layers of the lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the end portion of the optical fiber ferrule <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The rectangular broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> show the outline of the package produced by the resin molding. The curved broken lines covering the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> show the outline of the encapsulation formed by the transparent resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The lead frames&apos; end portions projecting from the package are connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, which are used to connect the module with the next-stage circuit substrate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a longitudinal cross section showing the connection between the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and a circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the connection is performed by inserting the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> between the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The internal distance between the first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is slightly smaller than the thickness of the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to be inserted. This structure acting like a spring prevents the easy displacement of the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> once the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted between the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The top surface and back surface of the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are provided with metallized patterns. The metallized patterns are connected to electrical components <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> mounted on the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and extend to contactors <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(B)), which provide the contact with the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The contactors <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are connected to the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> by the below-described reflow soldering method accompanied by infrared beating. This operation forms soldering portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The two layers of the lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> combine the functions of electrical connection and mechanical connection. The combined functions are made possible because of the dual-layer structure produced by the lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(A) and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(B), it is desirable to provide convex portions <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at the lead frames in the connector portions and to provide guide grooves <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the package <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(A) and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(B) show the procedure for connecting the optical communication module with the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(A) is the side view, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(B) is the plan view. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(A), the lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the connector portions are partially bent to form the convex portions <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> facing the opposite lead frames. The circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is held between the upper and lower lead frames. This structure prevents the longitudinal displacement of the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> In order to determine the position of the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the lateral direction, a direction perpendicular to the protruding direction of the lead frames, the package is provided with the guide grooves <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(B). The guide grooves <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are formed when the package is formed. The distance between the opposite innermost walls of the guide grooves <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> corresponds to the width of the end portion of the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The guide grooves <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> precisely determine the position of the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the lateral direction, enabling the secure connection between the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> When a standard circuit substrate for testing is used as the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the module can be tested before being completely connected with a circuit substrate to be coupled. This method can detect defective modules in advance, eliminating unproductive processes and thereby contributing to a cost reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> As an alternative, a circuit substrate manufactured as the product can be coupled with the module to carry out the test before the complete connection by soldering. In this case, when the test proves the satisfactory operation, the subsequent reflow soldering completes the connection, and the article is sent to the mass-production line. This method is also effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The method of connecting an optical communication module of the present invention with the next-stage circuit substrate is explained in detail below, referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>(A) to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>(E), which illustrate the process of this method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> (1) Production of the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> {circle over (1)} Step for printing solder (A): As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(A), cream solder is printed at connecting portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to be connected with the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the optical communication module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and at mounting portions <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> for mounting required electrical components <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> on one of the two main surfaces of the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. It is desirable that the solder printing at the connecting portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> be carried out by using a metal mask having proper thickness and openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> {circle over (2)} Step for mounting the electrical components <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (B): As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(B), the electrical components <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are mounted on the mounting portions <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> where the cream solder is printed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> {circle over (3)} Step for soldering the mounting portions <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and forming solder bumps (C): As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(C), the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on which the electrical components <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are mounted is placed in a reflow-soldering furnace to carry out the soldering. Solder bumps <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are concurrently formed at the connecting portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in this step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The other main surface of the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also undergoes steps {circle over (1)} to {circle over (3)} above. This concludes the production of the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that has on its two main surfaces the solder bumps <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> formed at the connecting portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the electrical components <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> (2) Performance test of the optical communication module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>: Step for the performance test: The performance test is carried out by tentatively fitting the optical communication module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a testing circuit substrate having the same function as that of the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to be connected. This test eliminates defective modules. The fitting method is explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> (3) Fitting of the connecting portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the optical communication module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>: Step for the fitting (D): As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(D), the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted between the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The insertion is performed by sliding the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> along the guide grooves provided in the package <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The guide grooves are omitted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(D), although they are indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(B) by the numeral <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are overlaid on the solder bumps <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> on the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Thus, the module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fitted with the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> (4) Solder-bonding of the fitted portions of the optical communication module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by the non-contact heating method: Step for solder-bonding (E): As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(E), the fitted portions of the module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are securely connected by reflow soldering. It is desirable that the fitted portions be heated both from above and from below. It is desirable that the heating method be the infrared heating method, the hot-air heating method, or the combination of these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> In this example, the lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have exposed portions between the main body of the module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The exposed portions are enclosed by resin encapsulation. Step for the resin encapsulation: As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> protruding from the package of the module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have exposed portions between the package and the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The exposed portions are enclosed by the resin encapsulation method to form a resin-encapsulated portion <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the exposed portions are the underside of the first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the top side of the second lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the space between the first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> In this example, as described above, the resin-encapsulated portion <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is formed so as to enclose the soldering portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the exposed portions of the lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The resin-encapsulated portion <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is formed by using epoxy resin, which is also used for the package of the module <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The dual-layer structure of the lead frames has the following advantages: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> {circle over (1)} The number of lead pins required for the connection with the next-stage circuit substrate can be secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> {circle over (2)} The short distance between the LD and the driver ID reduces the impedance of the wiring circuits, thereby facilitating high-speed transmissions at a rate of 1 Gbps or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> {circle over (3)} The placement of the LD on the highly heat-conductive Si platform facilitates the heat dissipation to the outside through the first lead frame. The dual-layer structure of the lead frames enables ample provision of lead pins so that unconnected lead pins can be used for heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> {circle over (4)} The direct placement of the driver IC on the second lead frame facilitates the heat dissipation to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> {circle over (5)} Thermal isolation is provided between the first and second lead frames by the insulating spacer having low thermal conductivity. Consequently, the heat transferring from the driver IC to the second lead frame cannot flow into the temperature-sensitive LD through the first lead frame. As a result, the LD and the driver IC can be isolated both electrically and thermally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> {circle over (6)} The connector portions can also function as a means of mechanically connecting the next-stage circuit substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> {circle over (7)} The bonding between the LD and the next-stage circuit substrate can be stably performed by reflow soldering accompanied by non-contact heating. (The bonding has so far been performed solely by hand soldering.) The amount of the supplied solder can be stabilized by using a metal mask for supplying the cream solder. Consequently, not only is the quality of the soldering itself stabilized but also the production process is streamlined and the mass production can be facilitated. In short, this system is effective both in quality improvement and in cost reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> {circle over (8)} The optical communication module can also be tested electrically before being connected with the next-stage circuit substrate. This preliminary test prevents the defective modules from proceeding to the subsequent process. The absence of this preliminary test may result in the detection of defective modules after being completely connected with the next-stage circuit substrate, increasing the production cost considerably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention provides the resin encapsulation that encloses the exposed portions of the electroconductive media between the module and the next-stage circuit substrate. This resin encapsulation facilitates the impedance matching between the module and the next-stage circuit substrate, enabling high-speed operation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> show an optical transmitter module of the present invention in which three layers of lead frames are used. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a longitudinal cross section of the module. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a plan view of the module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> from which the driver IC and the second lead frame are removed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a plan view of the module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> An LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is supported by a first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> through an Si platform <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is directly supported by a second lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A third lead frame <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is placed between the first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. An insulating spacer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is placed between the first lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the third lead frame <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and between the third lead frame <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the second lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> This example differs from Example 1 in that three lead frames are provided so that an M-PD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for monitoring the light intensity of the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be connected to the third lead frame <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> located at the middle position. The M-PD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is placed on the insulating spacer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and connected to the third lead frame <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> through an interlayer wiring system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. As required, connections between the three lead frames are conducted through the interlayer wiring system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. If constituting elements and devices to be mounted are increased, the number of lead-frame layers can be increased further and the shape of the lead pins can be changed as required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> show methods of connecting the module with the next-stage circuit substrate. When all the circuits to be connected with the next-stage circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be provided by the two lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be inserted simply between the uppermost lead frame and the lowermost lead frame, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. When the connection requires all three lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> can be employed. More specifically, a three-circuit-layer circuit substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having a circuit pattern <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in its interior is used. The substrate has slightly larger openings at the center of the end portion so that the connection of the circuit pattern <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> can be performed by pouring molten solder into the places for the connection with the connector portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows an optical transceiver module in which two optical fibers are used and all lead frames protrude in the same direction. FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>(A) and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>(B) show the procedure for connecting the optical communication module of this example with the next-stage circuit substrate. FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>(A) and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>(B) are the same as FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(A) and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(B) shown in Example 1 except that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(B) has two optical fiber ferrules <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> This optical transceiver module has a structure in which the optical transmitter module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is basically juxtaposed with the optical receiver module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, two layers of lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are used. The lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are placed on the top face and the underface of a base made of a liquid crystal polymer, respectively. Each of the signal-transmitting portion and the signal-receiving portion has one optical fiber. The lead frames <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of each portion protrude in the same direction. The total number of lead pins for the signal transmission and reception is 32 (16 lead pins multiplied by 2 layers). They are effectively used for the signal circuits, grounding circuits, and heat dissipation, notably exerting the effects of the present invention. The method of connecting with the next-stage circuit substrate is much the same as in Examples 1 to 3. More specifically, the connection is performed by inserting the circuit substrate between the connector portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> provided at the end portions of the two lead frames. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows another example of an optical transceiver module in which three lead frames are used. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a plan view of the circuit structure of this example. </paragraph>

In this system, for example, the signal-transmitting portion has 12 LDs and 12 driver ICs, and the signal-receiving portion has 12 PDs and 12 amplifiers.

<heading lvl="1">Optical Transceiver Module: One Optical Fiber </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows an optical transceiver module in which one optical fiber is used for signal transmission and reception, and each lead frame protrudes in a different direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows a perspective view of this optical transceiver module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> In this optical transceiver module, an optical wavelength demultiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> composed of a wavelength-selective branching waveguide is provided by forming an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer on an Si platform <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This wavelength-demultiplexing system enables both transmission and reception of signals through one optical fiber. In this system, the optical waveguides of an LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a PD <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> are placed in close proximity. The module receives light having a wavelength of 1.55 &mgr;m and transmits light having a wavelength of 1.3 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> This optical transceiver module has three lead frames. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the neighboring lead frames protrude in a direction different from each other by 90 degrees. In order to avoid the interference between the electric circuits, a driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to an upper lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which protrudes from the rear side of the module (the LD driver&apos;s AC signal side {circle over (1)}. Some terminals of the driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are connected to a lower lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which protrudes from the viewer&apos;s side of the module (the LD driver&apos;s dc source side {circle over (2)}. The signal receiving circuit, which is most sensitive to electrical noises, is connected to a lead frame <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Although the lead frame <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is placed on the same plane as the lead frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the electric circuits for the two lead frames are separated. The lead frame <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is placed so as to be perpendicular to the lead frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for the driver IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the LD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which handles the most intense signals, in order to minimize the electromagnetic coupling. The position of the lead frame <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is indicated as the &ldquo;outlet side of the received signal {circle over (3)}&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention offers a structure in which both transmission and reception of signals can be performed through one optical fiber by dividing the light pathway. In other words, the application of the present invention is not limited by the number of optical fibers. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows a unit of an optical transceiver module in which one optical fiber is combined with an LD and a PD. As a matter of course, an optical transceiver module may comprise a plurality of such units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> As explained above, an optical communication module of the present invention has the following features: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> (a) The layered electroconductive media function as a means of connecting the module and the next-stage circuit substrate both electrically and mechanically. The number of lead pins for this connection can be secured. The structure for this connection can be miniaturized considerably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> (b) The short distance between the optoelectronic device (such as a light-emitting device or a light-receiving device) and the accompanying electric-circuit part decreases the impedance of the wiring circuits, facilitating high-speed signal transmissions at a rate of 1 Gbps or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> (c) The optoelectronic device and the electric-circuit part can be isolated thermally, because the heat generated by the optoelectronic device is dissipated through a first electroconductive medium and the heat generated by the electric-circuit part is dissipated through a second electroconductive medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> (d) The connection between the module and the next-stage circuit substrate can be performed by soldering accompanied by non-contact heating. A typical example is the reflow soldering method. As a result, the soldering is stabilized in quality, the production process is streamlined, and mass production can be facilitated. </paragraph>
