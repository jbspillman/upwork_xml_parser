<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system for optically coupling an optical fibre with a circuit element of an optical chip. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known to couple an optical fibre to an optical chip through a mounting block. The optical fibre is secured in an open-ended passageway extending between proximal and distal faces of the mounting block so that the fibre end is flush with the distal face. The distal face is then adhered to a face of the optical chip so that the fibre end is positioned to optically couple with a circuit element of the optical chip, for example an optical waveguide, a multiplexer, a de-multiplexer, a photodiode or a laser diode, i.e. an element of an optical circuit provided on the optical chip which receives, transmits, carries or processes an optical signal. Accurate alignment of the fibre end with the optical circuit element is needed for optimal optical coupling, especially when an optical signal is to be transmitted between the optical fibre and a waveguide or vice-versa. It would therefore be useful to provide means for aligning the optical fibre end with the circuit element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In EP-A-0458608 (BICC PIc) there is made known a system for optically coupling an optical fibre with an integrated optical chip in which the integrated optical chip is encapsulated in a moulded male connector part so that a face thereof having optical guides is flush with a face of the male connector part between a pair of guide pins. An optical fibre ribbon is encapsulated in a moulded female connector part with the ends of the individual optical fibres being flush with a face of the female connector part between a pair of guide holes. When the male and female connector parts are connected together by inserting the guide pins into the guide holes, the faces of the connector parts abut one another. Moreover, the positioning of the guide pins and holes is such as to result in passive alignment of the fibre ends with the optical guides for optical coupling therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is also known to use complementary guide pins and guide holes to passively align the ends of optical fibres for fibre-to-fibre optical coupling. In this regard, mention may be made of U.S. Pat. No. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>939</bold></highlight> (Shahid/Lucent Technologies Inc.) and U.S. Pat. No. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>867</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> (Luther et al/Siecor Corp.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The aim of the present invention is to provide novel means for aligning an optical fibre with a circuit element of an optical chip. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention there is provided a system comprising a carrier which is adapted to carry an optical fibre and an optical chip having a circuit element, the carrier and the optical chip being provided with co-operable alignment features for aligning the carrier with the optical chip so that the optical fibre and the circuit element are optically coupled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention therefore differs from the alignment solution made known in EP-A-0458608 supra in that the optical chip has an alignment feature with which the alignment feature on the carrier co-operates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a system comprising a plurality of optical chips each having a circuit element, and a carrier which is adapted to carry a plurality of optical fibres, one for each optical chip, the carrier and each optical chip having co-operable alignment features which, when the optical chips are arranged into a stack, co-operate to align the carrier so that the optical fibres are optically coupled with the circuit element of the respective optical chip in the stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Preferred features of the invention are set out in the dependent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> By way of example, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying Figures of drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is shown a system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention comprising a silicon carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a plurality of integrated silicon optical chips <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> arranged into a stack, each optical chip <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having an array <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of monolithic waveguides <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as is known in the art (see e.g. WO95/08787). As an example, the silicon carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be formed from a silicon wafer having a thickness of about 500 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, a plurality of rows of holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are etched in the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to extend therethrough. Each hole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is used to mount an optical fibre <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is matched to that of the optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for a close fit and the optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are secured in the holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with epoxy resin adhesive so that the ends thereof are substantially co-planar with a coupling face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As an example, the diameter of the holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be about 125 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may form part of an optical fibre ribbon or individual optical fibre cables. In either case, a distal part of the outer protective layer of the ribbon or each cable is stripped-off to reveal the optical fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As well as the holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for the optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, additional holes (not shown) are etched in the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the purpose of which will become clear shortly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> After the optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are secured in the holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the coupling face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the substantially co-planar ends of the optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are polished. After polishing, guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are inserted into the additional holes etched in the carrier I and secured in place with epoxy resin adhesive. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are arranged into pairs on opposing sides of the fibre holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, i.e. into a series of rows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the construction of the optical chips <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, on either side of the waveguide array <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> there is etched a V-shaped groove <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to extend along an upper face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the chip from an edge <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with a coupling face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, as is known in the art. The depth of the V-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be such that the tapered flanks are co-terminus, i.e. form an apex. Alternatively, the etch may be curtailed to provide a flat bottom to the grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In any event, the spacing between the V-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on each optical chip <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> matches the spacing of the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> whereby the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be slotted into the V-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As will be understood from FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the optical chips <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are stacked one upon the other with a series of lids <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> being used as spacers. The lids <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are preferably made from Pyrex, silica or silicon. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each lid <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has outer legs <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in which are etched V-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which correspond to the V-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the optical chips <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The outer legs <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of each lid <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are connected by a bridge element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the height of which is greater than the height of the waveguides <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the lids <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are secured to the associated optical chip <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a channel <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is formed by the opposed pairs of V-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the bridge element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> bridges the waveguide array <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The mutual spacing of the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is such that, once the optical chips <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have been stacked, the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are able to be inserted into the channels <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> formed between the optical chips <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the lids <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and secured in place by, for example, epoxy resin adhesive. Ideally, the relative dimensioning of the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the V-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is such as to provide a 4-point contact on the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of the fibre holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> relative to the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is such that inserting the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> into the channels <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> results in the fibre ends at the coupling face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the carrier I being accurately aligned with, and juxtaposed to, the waveguides <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for optical coupling therebetween. Accordingly, the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the channels <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> provide for passive alignment of the fibre ends with the waveguides <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> thereby ensuring efficient optical coupling therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing embodiment is for optically coupling a series of rows of optical fibres with a stack of optical chips, it will be understood that it is within the scope of the present invention for the carrier to be modified to optically couple a single row of optical fibres with a single optical chip, or to optically couple a column of single optical fibres to a stack of optical chips or to optically couple a single optical fibre to a single optical chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is shown an alternative lid <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> for use in place of the lid <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the lid <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is of a simple plate-like form and is secured to the upper face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of one of the optical chips <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through epoxy resin adhesive <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or some other suitable adhesive. In this case, the lid <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> would be applied to the optical chip <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> after the guide pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have been located in the V-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the chip <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The alternative lid <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> would be more suited to the case where the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is modified to work with a single optical chip <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> instead of a stack of optical chips <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for the optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are etched in the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the hole axes are at an inclined angle to the plane of the coupling face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In this manner, the axes of the optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> will be inclined to the axes of the waveguides <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This improves the optical coupling between the optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the waveguides <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by reducing the amount of optical signal loss, as detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,787,214 (Harpin et al/Bookham Technology Ltd.). The preferred angle &thgr; formed between the axes of the holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a normal to the coupling face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and hence the respective axes of the optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and waveguides <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, is 6-7&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the optical fibres <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are cleaved before being mounted in the holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The cleavage is such as to give each optical fibre <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> an end face which is inclined to the longitudinal axis of the optical fibre <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> so that the end face is generally co-planar with the coupling face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the optical fibre <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is mounted in its hole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Although not shown, the coupling face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the optical chips <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be inclined to the upper face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As an example, the coupling face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may form an interior angle of 94-98&deg; with the upper face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, preferably substantially 95&deg;. Expressed another way, the coupling face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be inclined at an angle of 4-8&deg;, preferably substantially 5&deg;, to a normal to the upper face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The ends of the waveguides <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at the coupling face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be similarly angled so as to be coplanar with the coupling face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above with reference to the accompanying Figures of drawings could, of course, be supplemented by a further carrier which is connected to the opposite ends of the optical chips <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the same fashion to optically couple optical fibres to the opposite ends of the waveguides <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the present invention is not restricted to the embodiments described but may be varied and modified in many different ways within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
