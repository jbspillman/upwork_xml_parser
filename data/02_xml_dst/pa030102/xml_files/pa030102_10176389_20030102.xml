<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;microarray&rdquo; is a device that is used in biotechnology and other science research. A microarray can be made by putting a large number of tiny samples on a microscope slide (usually made of glass, nylon, plastic, metal, etc.). In a &ldquo;cytology microarray,&rdquo; the samples are typically individual cells or groups of cells (or disrupted tissue) in a solution such as water and alcohol. In a &ldquo;tissue microarray,&rdquo; the samples are typically whole tissue (as opposed to the substantially free-floating cells in a cytology microarray). In order to examine the samples in microarray closely, the microarrays are typically stained with special dyes, and/or probed with DNA, proteins or antibodies (or other probes). The microarrays are then examined under a microscope or in a specialized kind of computerized microscope called an image cytometer. This can determine the makeup or identity of the cells or tissues under review. This can be helpful for a variety of medical purposes, such as identifying or diagnosing diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Tissue microarrays are sometimes advantageous because they keep the cells in their original tissue structure, and thus keep them in their original relationship with each other. However, tissue microarrays can be difficult to create and to assay because they can suffer from problems, known as &ldquo;artifacts.&rdquo; For example, when the cells are cut into thin sections, individual cells may be cut in half and thus important information can be lost. When the tissue is cut in thick sections it can be difficult to see the cells, and determine where one cell ends and another begins, because the cells overlap. Further, the tissue sections for one microarray are never precisely the same as the tissue sections for the next microarray because the microarrays are cut from different layers of the tissue. As a loose analogy, this is similar to a loaf of sliced bread. Each slice is a little bit different from the previous slice, and sometimes, in just one slice, the bread changes from middle pieces to an end piece, or even to nothing at all (once the loaf is finished). The same kind of thing happens with the individual cells in the tissue microarrays; the cells in one slice are not the same as the cells in the next slice. Tissue microarrays are also typically expensive to create. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Cytology microarrays, where the cells have been separated from each other and suspended in a suitable liquid, can be advantageous because they can be less expensive to make, and typically the cells can be put down on the slides in a &ldquo;monolayer,&rdquo; which means in a single layer so that there is little overlap of one cell and the next. However, making such cytology microarrays can also be expensive and difficult, for example because of inconsistent dispensing of the micro-volumes of liquid used for the cytology microarrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is gone unmet a need for inexpensive and simple methods and devices for making cytology microarrays. The present systems and methods provide these and other advantages. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The microvolume liquid dispensers disclosed herein provide simple and inexpensive approaches to making cytology microarrays. Briefly, the tips comprise an outer sleeve, typically shaped like a funnel, that holds a needle or pin. The pin moves back and forth inside the sleeve, or reciprocates. The tip of the pin slightly extends beyond the distal opening of the outer sleeve in one position, and is retracted in another position. When the pin is in the extended, or distal, position the shoulders of the pin contact the inner surfaces of the sleeve and block the cytology liquid from flowing through the opening. Thus the pin and sleeve cooperate to form a reservoir behind the blockage. When the pin is pushed up into the sleeve by touching the tip to a glass slide or other substrate, a passage is formed between the outer surface of the pin and the inner surface of the sleeve. The liquid in the reservoir then flows through the passage and onto the slide. Removing the tip from the substrate moves the pin back to its original position, re-forming the reservoir and leaving a precise droplet of liquid&mdash;a predetermined microvolume amount of the liquid&mdash;on the slide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The size and shape of the pin and sleeve can be cooperatively configured in any desired shape so that a precise amount of liquid flows from the reservoir when the tip is contacted with the substrate. Although a wide variety of additional attachments, such as springs or other biasing members, automated motion detectors, etc., can be provided and added, it is an advantage of the present tips that they do not need such attachments; they can be nothing more than routine plastic micropipette tips and simple metal needles (any other desired material can be used for either the sleeve or the pin), and the device can, if desired, be operated solely via manual operation and the effects of gravity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a microvolume liquid dispenser comprising a body, an outer sleeve extending from the body, and a reciprocating pin located within the outer sleeve. The outer sleeve comprises a distal opening and the pin reciprocates relative to the sleeve between a distal position wherein a distal tip of the pin extends beyond the distal opening and a proximal position. The outer sleeve and the reciprocating pin can be configured to cooperatively form a reservoir when the pin can be in the distal position and configured to cooperatively dispense, through a passage formed between a side of the distal opening and the pin, a predetermined microvolume amount of liquid from the reservoir when the pin moves in a cycle from the distal position to the proximal position then returns to the distal position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, wherein the dispenser can be a hand-held dispenser and the body comprises a handle, or the dispenser can be stationary and the body can be attached to a frame sized to fit on a substantially flat surface. (Unless expressly stated otherwise or clear from the context, all embodiments, aspects, features, etc., can be mixed and matched, combined and permuted in any desired manner.) The sleeve and pin can be configured to cooperatively dispense a volume per cycle that is suitable for a cytology microarray, and the passage can be sized to substantially avoid clogging by cells. The sleeve and pin can be configured such that the predetermined microvolume amount can be from about 0.05 &mgr;l to 0.5 &mgr;l per cycle, or otherwise as desired. The dispenser can further comprise a biasing element operably connected to at least one of the body and the outer sleeve and configured to urge the pin toward the distal position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a microvolume liquid dispenser tip comprising an outer sleeve and a reciprocating pin located within the outer sleeve, configured to cooperatively interact as discussed above. The inner surface of the sleeve, and the sleeve itself, can be substantially frustoconical and the outer surface of the pin can be correspondingly substantially frustoconical. The substantially frustoconical shape of the pin can comprise a concave curve near the distal tip. The distal opening of the sleeve can have a diameter from about 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm. The tip can be one of an array of the microvolume liquid dispenser tips, which array can be configured and sized to make a cytology microarray. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the present disclosure provides a cytology microarray maker comprising a frame operably connected to a body holding an array of microvolume liquid dispenser tips, at least two stages sized to support cytology microarrays, at least one upright member operably attached to the body to move the body and the array of tips substantially normal to the stages between at least an extended position wherein the tips contact a cytology microarray substrate located on the stage and a retracted position wherein the tips do not contact the cytology microarray substrate, and at least one axial member disposed along the frame and operably connected to the upright members to provide a track along which the upright members, the body and the array of tips can be movable along the track between the first and the second stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The microvolume liquid dispenser tips can be configured as discussed elsewhere herein or can be other configurations, and the maker can further comprise at least a third stage. The maker can be stationary and the frame can be sized to fit on a substantially flat surface or other surface as desired. The at least one axial member can comprise two rails extending along the frame, either separately from or as a part of the frame. The upright members can comprise two substantially planar elements slidably connected to the two rails and situated on either side of the stages, the substantially planar elements comprising corresponding elongated axial channels configured to slidably receive projections extending from the body. At least one of the frame and the upright members can be operably connected to body biasing element urging the body away from the stages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The stages can be substantially planar stands and can further comprise at least x-axis and y-axis adjustment mechanisms configured to adjust positions of the stages relative to at least one of the frame and each other. The body can comprise a plurality of floating channels each sized to releasably hold one tip. The maker (as with other devices and systems herein) can be substantially automated or substantially manually operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure also provides methods of dispensing a microvolume of liquid. The methods can comprise, a) providing a microvolume liquid dispenser tip as discussed herein; b) transiently contacting the distal tip and distal opening with a substrate thereby causing the pin to cycle; and, c) during the cycle, dispensing the liquid to the substrate. The sleeve and pin can be configured to cooperatively dispense a volume per cycle that is suitable for a cytology microarray. The tip can be one of an array of the tips, and the methods can comprise substantially simultaneously transiently contacting the array of tips with a cytology microarray platform, thereby causing the pin to cycle, and thereby forming the cytology microarray on the platform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The methods can also comprise, before providing the tip containing the liquid, loading the liquid into the tip by placing the tip into a source of the liquid and suctioning up the liquid using capillary action. The tip can also be loaded by loading the liquid into the tip through a proximal opening located at a proximal area of the tip, or otherwise as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure further provides methods of making a cytology microarray comprising: a) providing a cytology microarray maker as discussed herein; b) loading the array of tips with liquid cytological specimens by transiently moving the array of tips into the liquid cytological specimens and suctioning up the liquid cytological specimens using capillary action; c) moving the array of tips along the axial member to the second stage; and, d) making the cytology array by transiently contacting the array of tips with the cytology microarray substrate. If desired, the microvolume liquid dispenser tips can comprise an outer sleeve and a reciprocating pin as discussed herein. The frame can further comprise a third stage, and the methods can comprise moving the array of tips along the axial member to the third stage; then making a second cytology array. The second cytology array can be made without reloading the tips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The methods can comprise sliding the upright members along the two rails between the cytology microarray template and substrate, and then pushing the array downwardly (for example by pushing down on the array itself or on the body) to contact the cytology microarray template and substrate, respectively. The methods can also comprise adjusting the stages on at least one of an x-axis and a y-axis. Where the body comprises a plurality of floating channels each sized to releasably hold one tip, the methods can comprise placing the tips in the body to create the array of tips and removing the tips from the body after making the cytology array. The methods can also comprise removing the cytology array template and the cytology array from the stages then placing new cytology array substrates on the stages and making additional cytology arrays. The additional cytology arrays can be made without reloading the tips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure still further provides tip means for microvolume liquid dispensing comprising: a) an outer sleeve means for holding the liquid, b) a reciprocating pin means located within the outer sleeve for cooperatively dispensing, through a passage formed between a side of the outer sleeve means and the pin means, a predetermined microvolume amount of liquid when the pin moves in a cycle from a distal position to a proximal position then returns to a distal position. A means for making cytology microarrays can comprise: a) a frame means for holding a body means, b) the body means for holding an array of tips means for dispensing a microvolume of liquid, c) at least two stage means for supporting cytology microarrays, d) at least two upright member means operably attached to the body for moving the body means substantially normal to the stage means, and e) at least one axial member means disposed along the frame and operably connected to the upright members for moving the upright member means between the two stage means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A methods of dispensing a microvolume of liquid can comprise the steps of: a) a step of providing a microvolume liquid dispenser tip means, as discussed herein, containing the liquid; b) transiently contacting the distal tip and distal opening with a substrate thereby causing the pin to cycle; and, c) during the cycle, dispensing the liquid onto the substrate. The sleeve means and pin means can be configured for cooperatively dispensing a volume per cycle that can be suitable for a cytology microarray, and the methods comprise the step of dispensing a spot of cell-containing liquid sized for the cytology microarray. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> High throughput genomic screening methodologies generate very large amounts of genetic, gene expression, and protein content information, and can be mined to determine possible markers (e.g., DNA sequence, mRNA, protein and antibodies to same) for a wide variety of clinical conditions (e.g., disease state, environmental induced damage, infection, or genetic susceptibility markers). Many of these markers can be evaluated, tested, verified and utilized on cellular material such as tissue sections, cytological preparations or extracted cellular components. It is generally accepted that many more markers will be suggested than will eventually be found to be clinically useful. Additionally, these markers are likely to be costly to manufacture and market. Thus, strategies that assist effective testing, verification and utilization of these markers would be of benefit. For these and other reasons, tissue microarrays are made from wax blocks that have tens to thousands of cylindrical tissue samples from random (cylinders adjacent to each other can be arbitrarily determined) arrangements of sources are constructed and used for these purposes. However, tissue microarrays have a number of drawbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Cytology microarray provide a less labor-intensive, more uniform representation, and use less tissue from a sample. These arrays of spotted (deposited) cytological material may have from one to several thousands of sample cells per spot. The cells deposited may be unfixed, fixed, pre-processed disaggregated cells from solid tissue samples, etc. Each spot of cells may be from different sources, or may be from the same source, or some of each. The spots may be spatially distinct or over lapping. The spatial extent of each spot will be determined by the fluid containing the cells, the surface they are deposited onto and the environment in which they are deposited (humidity, temperature, vapor pressure of the atmosphere, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The systems and methods discussed herein provide simple and easy ways to make such cytological microarrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Turning to the Figures, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> each schematically depict one cycle of a microvolume liquid dispenser tip. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, for example, the microvolume liquid dispenser tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has an outer sleeve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is located within the outer sleeve, and may or may not be physically attached to outer sleeve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Outer sleeve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises a distal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and an inner surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As depicted, outer sleeve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is substantially frustoconical, ending in distal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; other shapes are possible as desired. Reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises an outer surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a shoulder <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a distal tip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As depicted, the shoulder <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and distal tip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provide a substantially frustoconical form to reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in the Figure, in this embodiment shoulder <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> further provides for a concave curve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> near distal tip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is in a distal position with respect to outer sleeve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the outer surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> contacts an inner surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of outer sleeve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to substantially form a seal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the point of contact. Because of the seal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, any liquid maintained proximal to the seal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> forms a reservoir <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is moved proximally relative to outer sleeve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a passage <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is created between reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a side <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of distal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of outer sleeve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, liquid, which in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a cytological fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, can flow through passage <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to reach cytology platform <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which, as embodied in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is a substantially planar substrate. If desired, other forms of substrate, such as substantially spherical or otherwise curved substrates as may be found in the bottom of certain wells of desirable microarray substrates, such as 96-well plates, are also suitable for use. Passage <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be sized to substantially avoid clogging by the cells when the liquid being dispensed is a cytological fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If desired, the reciprocation of reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be caused by various assorted attachments to either the outer sleeve or the pin, for example a biasing element <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, but it is a feature and an advantage of the present systems and methods that no additional elements are necessary to provide the precisely dispensed quantities of cytological fluids or other chemical solutions (such as chemical solution <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> dispensed onto substrate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Thus, it is inexpensive and easy to move reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in a cycle from the distal position to the proximal position and then back to the distal position simply by contacting the dispenser tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the desired substrate. Similarly, it is possible to load the tip with a liquid merely by placing the tip into the source of the liquid and suctioning up the liquid using capillary action. Conversely, if desired, the liquid may be loaded into the tip through a proximal opening located at a proximal area of the dispensing tip, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for example at the top of dispensing tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> where it abuts body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The result of moving the reciprocating pin through a cycle is the dispensing, and typically deposit, of a spot of the desired fluid onto the receiving surface such as the cytology platform <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> or substrate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, a spot <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed on the receiving surface. The spot can be of medium size, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, of small size as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, or of a large size as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Generally, the spots comprise from about 0.05 &mgr;l to about 0.5 &mgr;l with a typical spot being about 0.1 &mgr;l. The spots be either larger or smaller if desired. Typically, depending upon the desired format, the solution comprising the cells (or other chemical solution if not a cytological application), the distal opening diameter will typically be from about 0.5 mm to about 1.5 mm, for example about 0.83 mm to 1 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As already noted, the distal tip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extends beyond the distal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of outer sleeve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Such extension can be effected by a single point of reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, or reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be shaped to provide a plurality of points or otherwise configured to extend beyond distal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Typically reciprocation pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and distal tip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are unitary, but if desired they can be operably connected to provide the same functions (indeed, for example where the tip is designed to be used with a deep well plate such as certain 96-well plates, the distal tip may be configured to contact the side of the well as opposed to the bottom of the well yet still releasing the fluid at the desired point, for example substantially when the dispensing tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> contacts the bottom of the well (or other desired location). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The spot size can be controlled by a variety of factors in addition to the size of the reciprocating pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the outer sleeve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. For example, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, spot size can be affected by alcohol to water concentration, the concentration of cells, or other factors as desired. In view of the present application, a skilled person will be able to control the spot size quite precisely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts a hand-held embodiment of the microvolume liquid dispenser discussed herein. In particular, hand-held micropipette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a handle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As depicted, micropipette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> additionally comprises a plunger <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is useful for typical operation of the micropipette but which is not necessary for the present systems for dispensing microvolumes of liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts a cytology microarray maker <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As depicted, frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is sized to be stationary and fit on a substantially flat surface although it can be configured or sized to fit any desired surface. Maker <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a first stage <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> second stage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and third stage <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, each of which are capable of supporting or holding a cytology array template, cytology array substrate or other desired platform or surface. A cytology microarray template is a cytology microarray that comprises a plurality of liquid cytological specimens or other suitable samples (such as control samples or reference samples). This template can provide samples to the microvolume dispensing tips by transiently contacting the tips into the sample, i.e., the source of the liquid, and then suctioning up the liquid, for example by using capillary action, an active vacuum or otherwise as desired. It is an advantage of the present embodiment that enough liquid from the template can be loaded into the tips at one time to make a plurality of cytological microarrays without reloading. Accordingly, a plurality of different stains, probes or other investigative material can be used with different cytological microarrays but without significant variation in the samples in the microarrays, both in the volume of a given sample in the microarray and in the location of the samples in one microarray to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Cytology microarray maker <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> further comprises a body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that holds an array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of tips (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) between upright members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> further comprises at least one axial member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which in the embodiment depicted comprises two rails <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extending along frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, rails <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are attached to the frame via rail attachments <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Conversely, the rails <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or other axial member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be integrally formed in frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, for example being formed by the provision of axial slots along frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Rails <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, or other axial member, provide a track disposed along the frame such that the array of tips, the body, the upright members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, etc., are movable along the track between the various stages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, two sets of removable slide cards <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are shown, one each above the first stage and second stage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Upright members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which as depicted are substantially planar elements <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> can be moved along frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by pushing or pulling them along rails <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. If desired, the positioning of the upright members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be facilitated by the provision of retaining elements indicating when the upright members are in the proper location, for example by the provision of spring-loaded ball and indent centering and lock mechanisms, or any other desired positioning mechanism. The maker <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also has a frame support <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> sized for a substantially planar surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts a cytology microarray maker <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprising a body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> holding an array of tips <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a cytology microarray template <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Upright members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> comprise substantially planar elements <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, which in turn comprise elongated axial channels <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Substantially planar elements <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, are slidably connected to the rails <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and are situated on either side of the stages. Elongated axial channels <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> provide locations configured to slidably receive projections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extending from body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> also depicts a floating channel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in dotted line for one of the tips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; similar floating channels are provided for each of the microvolume dispenser tips in array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> but not depicted. The floating channels are each sized to releasably hold one tip. If desired, two or more of the channels can be interlocked, provided that adequate spacing between the tips is maintained when moving the array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from one stage to another. Also depicted are body biasing elements <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which urge the body <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> away from the various stages. This facilitates both loading the tips and making the microarrays because one need merely push down on the body to load the tips/dispense from the tips; the tips then automatically reciprocate away from the given cytology element upon release of the pressure. As depicted, the various embodiments are used in an orientation where gravity is below the tips and assists in maintaining the tips in place in the body and in maintaining the fluid in the reservoirs. It is possible to provide other orientations for the various elements if desired. In addition, the body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> moves in an orientation that is substantially normal to the various cytology templates/substrates. As used herein, substantially normal includes angles other than <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> degrees if desired by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts a tabletop <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> suitable for use with, and comprising a part of, frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In tabletop <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> as depicted, a variable Y adjustment device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a variable X adjustment device at <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are provided. Movement of these devices in the desired direction enhances the ability to precisely place templates and substrates under the body and array of tips. Also depicted are a plurality of cytological microarray substrates <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, in this case glass slides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provides photographs of a variety of arrays made using various dispensing tips. In each of FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, each of the spots provide a cytological specimen and has been stained with H &amp; E. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the spots were made without using the reciprocating needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> discussed elsewhere and, as can be see, the spots are diffuse and large. In contrast, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, medium and small spots were created using outer sleeves or funnels and reciprocating pins. Small pins and a high cell concentration solution were used to make medium spots in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and large pins and a high cell concentration solution were used to make small spots in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference> provide photomicrographs at various magnifications (4&times;, 10&times; and 20&times;) of a single spot from the cytological microarrays depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 11</cross-reference> respectively. As can be seen, the spots in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> are smaller, as can also be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, and the cells are not as clustered and there is reduced overlapping. Thus the cells are better capable of analysis using certain analysis methods such as certain image cytometry analyses. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> also depicts a series of micrographs of magnification 4&times;, 10&times; and 20&times; of a single spot from a hand spotted cytology microarray that was stained with H &amp; E wherein the microvolume dispensing tip had a large reciprocating pin and a low cell concentration solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference> depict screen shots of cells images collected by an automated image cytometer. The Figures demonstrating the distribution of the images collected from the spots both with and without the cytological microvolume dispensing tip discussed herein. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the spots were created using a funnel only, with out a reciprocating pin, whereas in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> the spots were created using both the outer sleeve and the reciprocating pin (which was a small needle in this case). In each figure, low cell concentration solutions were used for the spots in the graphs on the left, high cell concentration solutions were used for the spots in the graphs on the right. As can be seen, the spots in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> are significantly larger and the spots in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> are better suited for some analyses than are the spots in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> provides graphs depicting the distribution of cell images collected by an automated image cytometer wherein the spots were created using an outer sleeve only (on the left in each graph) and an outer sleeve with a small reciprocating pin (on the right in each graph). Two different cell concentrations were used for each pair in each graph, with low concentrations on the left and high concentrations on the right). The low cell concentrations, and the funnels without reciprocating pins created larger spots, with more cells imaged per spot. For the high cell concentration dispensed through a funnel with a reciprocating pin, the cell density was too high and it appears that the number of overlapping cell clusters artificially reduced the number of cells counted by the automated image cytometer. It appears that the cell concentration changes the viscosity of the solution and that the high concentration solution exhibits the characteristics of a viscous or slow spreading or rapidly evaporating solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, different alcohol concentrations were used. As can be seen, increasing the alcohol concentration increased the spot size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Turning to some additional discussion of various aspects, the amount of fluid deposited depends in part upon the shape of the outer sleeve and the shape of the reciprocating pin. The size to which the fluid spreads to create the spot depends in part on the suspension fluid, the type of planar surface, and the environment in which the process takes place. For example, low humidity, moderate temperature and a hydrophilic surface will cause the formation of a smaller spot than will high humidity, low temperature and a hydrophilic surface. Additionally, the suspension fluid may comprise rapidly drying fluids such as alcohol. The rate of spread of the fluid affects creation of a cellular monolayer. Too slow with the spreading and too fast with the evaporation with a high cell density will lead to many clumped, overlapping cells. Too fast with the spreading and too slow with evaporation will lead to larger than desired spots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In addition to creating arrays of distinct spots on a planar surface, the same techniques and approach can be used to very rapidly turn a cell suspension into a spatially localized monolayer-type preparation for traditional cytological applications, as well as for automated quantitative cytological applications. This can be done by creating an area of spots that just touch or slightly overlap. These spots would be placed in an interleaved fashion such that new spots are either deposited on a virgin surface or adjacent to completely dry spots so as to create the optimal monolayer without causing all the deposited cells to bunch up along the edge or into clumps. The cytological preparation is typically disaggregated so as to not plug or clump up the outer sleeves or outer sleeve reciprocating pin combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The outer sleeve or reciprocating pin outer sleeve combinations may also be used to disaggregate cytological samples by utilizing the shear forces involved in flowing the sample multiple times backwards and/or forwards through the outer sleeve or outer sleeve reciprocating pin combination. It is possible to create different controllable shear forces by varying the position of the reciprocating pin within the outer sleeve and by designing the shape of the reciprocating pin-outer sleeve contact areas appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The methodologies and systems herein can typically be implemented in parallel such that many (2 to 32 or more) spots could be deposited in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Applications for cytology microarrays in addition to those discussed elsewhere herein include 1) Use with multiple FISH probes where one probe is applied to a cytology microarray comprising samples from multiple subjects; 2) Use with multiple messenger RNA probes for expression analysis from multiple subjects; 3) Use with disease markers across multiple subjects or samples to reduce cost and/or increase throughput; 4) Use with an automated cytometry device to allow ploidy data to be rapidly collected from many samples/subjects disposed on a single slide, which can assist in reducing slide-to-slide staining variations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The ability to make many equivalent cytology microarrays confers other possibilities. For example, given 200 tumor samples which need to be examined for about 1000 genetic changes or about 1000 expression changes, one can disaggregate the samples, create 200 cell suspensions, deposit 200 spots (one per sample) on each of 1000 slides (one spot from each sample for each slide, 100 cells per spot for a total cell count of about 100,000 cells) and then mark each slide with either a specific FISH probe (1 or multicolor per slide) or a specific mRNA marker for expression analysis. Thus, instead of running 600 DNA tissue microarrays, each of which typically uses about 1 million cells costs more per slide than cytology microarrays, one can run 1000 cytology microarrays for less cost, in some cases possibly about 10% the cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The data produced by each of the tissue microarray and the cytology microarray would be the about same except with the cytology microarray DNA data one would have FISH spot counts which can detect single deletions very reliably, as well as be able to differentiate the contamination cells (stromal, connective tissue, blood, vessel wall, etc.) from the tumor cells, which could reduce the need for tissue microdissection. The differentiation could be on the basis of morphological features or various counter stains. For the expression data, the result could be intensity expression for individual cells in a spot, the average expression, and the variance of expression. Given that mRNA marker and DNA FISH probe staining processes do not interact significantly it would be possible to perform both tests on the same samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Thus, in one aspect, one can match the FISH probe to the expression marker, or otherwise match gene and protein expression assays, and do both gene and gene expression at the same time. Also at a later date as more specific protein markers become available, one could measure all three of gene, gene expression and gene product on the same cells at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The present systems and methods are also useful for combining cytology microarrays (or for that matter, tissue microarrays) with complex liquid handling. For example, it would be possible to take multiple specimens from a single sample the deposit (or block) many spots of cells (or tissue cores) on a slide or slides and then deposit fixed (typically very small) amounts (usually no more than a single drop) of different marker solutions on different tissue or cell spots on the slide. This allows the different markers to bind the cell components (DNA, mRNA, etc.). The cell markers are then typically washed off the slide. To reduce the risk of cross contamination of marker solutions to adjacent spots, the small amounts of marker solution could be removed using a blotter (wicking material) in soft contact with the slide to wick away most of the marker solution then wash the slide. In all of these applications, a flexible automated cytometer (transmission and fluorescence mode) would be extremely valuable to automate the interpretation of the slides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> To reduce the spot to spot contamination (of either fluids and cells) it can be beneficial to use a slide with a removable or non-removable mask that creates shallow or deep wells, then depositing one spot into each well. The mask would contain the cell spot as well as any added solutions. For an example of a masked slide with removable mask see U.S. Pat. No. 5,784,193. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Turning to some additional discussion of the methods herein, in some aspects the methods comprising dispensing a microvolume of liquid. Such methods can comprise a) providing a microvolume liquid dispenser tip as discussed herein, b) transiently contacting the distal tip and distal opening with a substrate thereby causing the pin to cycle, for example by briefly touching the tip and the substrate; and, c) during the cycle, dispensing the liquid to the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The sleeve and pin can be configured to cooperatively dispense a volume per cycle suitable for a cytology microarray, and the passage can be sized to substantially avoid clogging by the cells. The microvolume liquid dispenser tip can be one of an array of tips, the tips and array configured and sized to make a cytology microarray. The method can comprise substantially simultaneously transiently contacting the array of tips with a cytology microarray platform, thereby causing the pin to cycle, and thereby forming the cytology microarray on the platform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The methods can also make cytology microarrays. Such methods can comprise providing a frame holding a body holding an array of microvolume liquid dispenser tips, at least first and second stages sized to support cytology microarrays, upright members operably attached to the body to move the body and tips substantially normal to the stages between at least an extended position wherein the tips contact a cytology microarray substrate located on the stage and a retracted position wherein the tips do not contact the cytology microarray substrate, and at least one axial member disposed along the frame and to move the upright members between the stages. The first stage holds a cytology microarray template comprising an array of liquid cytological specimens and the second stage holds a cytology microarray substrate. The tips in the array are then loaded with the liquid cytological specimens by transiently moving the array of tips into the liquid cytological specimens and suctioning up the liquid cytological specimens using capillary action. Next, the array of tips is moved to the second stage, where the cytology array is made by transiently contacting the array of tips with the cytology microarray substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The frame can further comprises a third stage holding a cytology microarray substrate and a second cytology array can be made by moving the array to the third stage then transiently contacting the array of tips with the second cytology microarray substrate. In some embodiments, this can be done without reloading the tips. Additionally, the substrates and the template(s) can be removed or covered, then additional substrates can be provided and additional cytology arrays created. The method can further comprise adjusting the stages on at least one of an x-axis and a y-axis relative to at least one of the frame and each other. The methods can also comprise placing the tips in the body to create the array of tips and removing the tips from the body after making the cytology array. As with the devices herein, the methods can be either substantially manual or automated.
