<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a driving circuit and a method of driving an active-matrix type organic electroluminescent device, and more particularly to a driving circuit and a method of driving an organic electroluminescent device having the capability of shortening a time required to display picture data on a screen, wherein the picture data applied from a current driver integrated circuit (IC) is of a minimum gray level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A related art organic electroluminescent device driving circuit will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> generally illustrates a block diagram of a driving circuit used in an active-matrix type organic electroluminescent device. The driving circuit includes a gate driver unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for sequentially outputting a control signal to select gate lines in a luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a current driver unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for supplying picture data to data lines in the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> corresponding to gate lines that are selected by the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and selectively driving organic electroluminescent devices connected to the selected line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a driving circuit unit used in an organic electroluminescent device. The driving circuit unit includes first and second PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, wherein the sources of the first and second PMOS transistors are connected to a power voltage (VDD) and wherein the gates of the first and second PMOS transistors are commonly connected; a first capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected between the power voltage (VDD) and the commonly connected gates of the first and second PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; an organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> connected between a drain of the first PMOS transistor PM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a ground (VSS); a source of a third PMOS transistor PM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> connected to the commonly connected gates of the first and second PMOS transistors; a drain of the third PMOS transistor PM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> connected to a drain of the second PMOS transistor PM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so as to be energized as a gate of the third PMOS transistor receives a control signal from the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; a source of a fourth PMOS transistor PM<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connected to commonly connected drains of the second and third PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so as to be energized as a gate of the fourth PMOS transistor receives a control signal of the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; and a first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected between a drain of the fourth PMOS transistor PM<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the ground (VSS), so as to be energized as a gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives an analog voltage, corresponding to the picture data from the current driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An operation of the electroluminescent device illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When a line in the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is selected by a control signal from the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> low potential signal is applied from the driving circuit unit in the organic electroluminescent device to the gates of the third and fourth PMO transistors PM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, so that the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be energized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Analog voltages, corresponding to picture data, may be applied from the current driver unit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In applying the analog voltages, the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is energized may be controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A proper voltage value may therefore be outputted from the current driver unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> according to the gray level characteristics of each of the individual organic electroluminescent devices <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. For example, if a gray level is to be implemented as a 8 bit digital data signal, the current driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> converts digital values between a predetermined maximum gray level of, for example, &lsquo;11111111&rsquo; and a predetermined minimum gray level of, for example, &lsquo;00000000&rsquo; to analog voltage values using a digital/analog converter. The digital/analog converter applies the analog voltage values to gates of the first NMOS transistors NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby controlling the degree to which the first NMOS transistors NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are energized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are energized, a predetermined amount of current flows through a first route beginning at the power voltage (VDD) to the second and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, from the second and fourth PMOS transistors to the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and from the first NMOS transistor to ground (VSS). The predetermined amount of current flows through the first route according to the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is energized by the analog voltage value supplied from the current driver unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. According to the principles of current mirroring, a predetermined amount of current also flows through a second route beginning at the power voltage (VDD) then flowing to the first PMOS transistor PM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then to the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and lastly to ground (VSS) thereby controlling luminescent characteristics of the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> If a predetermined maximum gray level is to be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the current driver unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> converts a digital value of, for example, &lsquo;11111111&rsquo; into a corresponding analog voltage value and applies the corresponding analog voltage value to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is energized, is maximized allowing a maximum amount of current to flow through the first route. Accordingly, a maximum amount of current also flows through the second route, so that the predetermined maximum gray level may be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> If a predetermined minimum gray level is to be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the current driver unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> converts a digital value of, for example, &lsquo;00000000&rsquo; into a corresponding analog voltage value and applies the corresponding analog voltage to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned off, e.g., placed in a floating state, such that no current flows through either the first or second routes so that the predetermined minimum gray level may be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The gate driver unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> sequentially outputs a series of control signals so that the first through the last gate lines in the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in which a plurality of the organic electroluminescent devices <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are arranged, may be sequentially selected to display one frame of a picture on a screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is coupled to the first gate line in the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be energized when the first line is selected by the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, an analog voltage value specific to the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be applied to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the current driver unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to control the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is energized. Accordingly, a predetermined amount of current flows to the first and second routes so that a proper gray level may be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> After the first gate line has been selected by the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the next consecutive gate line is selected and the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> coupled to the first gate line are turned off. Accordingly, the gray level of the corresponding organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the first gate line is maintained by the first capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> until the last gate line in the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is selected, thereby displaying one frame of a picture on a screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> However, the related art driving circuit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> has the following problem. When an organic electroluminescent device consecutively displays a maximum gray level in a first frame of a picture and then again in a second frame, the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> energized in the first picture frame turned off and induced into a floating state. The voltage charged in the first capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is then gradually reduced from the maximum gray level to the minimum gray level. Accordingly, it is impossible to accurately display the appropriate gray level within an organic electroluminescent device. Further, it becomes difficult to drive the organic electroluminescent devices with a quick response speed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A driving circuit operation in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when a gate line within the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is receives a control signal from the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a low potential signal from the organic electroluminescent device driving circuit is applied to the gates of the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be energized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, within the current driver unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the gray level analog voltage corresponding to the picture data is applied to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thereby controlling the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is energized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A proper voltage value may therefore be outputted from the current driver unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to the gray level characteristics of each of the individual organic electroluminescent devices <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. For example, if a gray level is to be implemented as a 8 bit digital data signal, the current driver <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> converts digital values between a predetermined maximum gray level of, for example, &lsquo;11111111&rsquo; and a predetermined minimum gray level of, for example, &lsquo;00000000&rsquo; to analog voltage values through a digital/analog converter. The current driver <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> then applies the analog voltage values to the gates of the first NMOS transistors NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby controlling the degree to which the first NMOS transistors NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are energized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are energized, a predetermined amount of current flows through a first route beginning at the power voltage (VDD) to the second and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, from the second and fourth transistors to the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and from the first NMOS transistor to ground (VSS). The predetermined amount of current flows through the first route according to the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is energized by the analog voltage value supplied from the current driver unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. According to the principles of current mirroring, a predetermined amount of current also flows through a second route beginning at the power voltage (VDD) then flowing to the first PMOS transistor PM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, then to the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and lastly to ground (VSS) thereby controlling luminescence characteristics of the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> If a predetermined maximum gray level is to be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the current driver unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> converts a digital value of, for example, &lsquo;11111111&rsquo; into a corresponding gray level analog voltage value and applies the corresponding gray level analog voltage value to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is energized, is maximized allowing a maximum amount of current to flow through the first route. Accordingly, the maximum amount of current also flows through the second route so that the predetermined maximum gray level may be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> If a predetermined minimum gray level is to be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the current driver unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> converts a digital value of, for example, &lsquo;00000000&rsquo; into a corresponding gray level analog voltage value and applies the corresponding gray level analog voltage value to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is turned off, e.g., placed in a floating state, such that no current flows through either the first or second routes so that the predetermined minimum gray level may be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The gate driver unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> outputs a series of control signals so that the first through last gate lines in the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in which a plurality of the organic electroluminescent devices <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are arranged, may be sequentially selected to display one frame of a picture on a screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is coupled to the first gate line of the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be energized when the first line is selected by the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, an analog voltage value specific to the organic electroluminescent device may be applied to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the current driver unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to control the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is energized. Accordingly, a predetermined amount of current flows through the first and second routes so that a proper gray level may be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> After the first gate line has been selected by the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the next consecutive gate line is selected and the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> coupled to first gate line are turned off. Accordingly, the gray level of the corresponding organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is maintained by the first capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> until the last gate line in the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is selected, thereby displaying one frame of a picture on a screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, as discussed above, the minimum gray level judgment unit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may be installed in the current driver unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The minimum gray level judgment unit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may include a NOR gate NOR<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> that performs a NOR operation on the digital value of the gray level for the organic electroluminescent device generated by the current driver <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when a digital value of a predetermined minimum gray level of, for example, &lsquo;00000000&rsquo; is inputted, the minimum gray level judgment unit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> selectively outputs a logical &lsquo;high&rsquo; potential, thereby indicating that the digital value has been determined to be of the predetermined minimum gray level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The NOR gate NOR<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> may be altered using an inverter. Accordingly, the inverter may invert the digital value of the gray level for an organic electroluminescent device outputted from the current driver <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Further, an AND gate may be added to perform an AND operation on the output of the inverter in order to obtain the same output value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the switching unit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> selectively supplies a reference voltage (Vref) to the first route if the NOR gate NOR<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> outputs a logical &lsquo;high&rsquo; potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A method of driving the organic electroluminescent device of the present invention will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, picture data is supplied to the organic electroluminescent device that is selected by the gate driver unit and the current driver unit is read (step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Next, it is determined whether the read picture data contains a digital value of a predetermined minimum gray level (step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> If the picture data does not contain a digital value of the predetermined minimum gray level, the corresponding organic electroluminescent device luminesces using current received from the current driver unit. If, however, the picture data does contain a digital value of the predetermined minimum gray level, the corresponding organic electroluminescent device receives no current from the current driver unit. However, a reference voltage is supplied to the corresponding organic electroluminescent device (step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when an organic electroluminescent device displays a predetermined gray level in a first frame of a picture and then displays the predetermined minimum gray level in a second, consecutive, frame, the reference voltage (Vref) may be supplied to the first route so that the organic electroluminescent device can display the predetermined gray level and then immediately display the minimum gray level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary view of a driving apparatus of an organic electroluminescent device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, when the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> displays a predetermined gray level, the current driver <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may be connected to the organic electroluminescent device driving circuit via the switching unit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An analog voltage corresponding to the digital picture data signal may be applied to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to control the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is energized. Accordingly, the current flowing to the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be controlled as required such that a predetermined gray level is displayed by the organic electroluminescent device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> displays a predetermined minimum gray level, the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is turned off. Further, the voltage driver <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> supplies the reference voltage (Vfref) to the organic electroluminescent device driving circuit via a connection made by the switching unit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. When the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> displays the predetermined minimum gray level, the first and second PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are turned off and the current flowing to the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is turned off so that the predetermined minimum gray level is displayed by the organic electroluminescent device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> If a predetermined maximum gray level is to be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the current driver unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> converts a digital value of, for example, &lsquo;11111111&rsquo; into a corresponding gray level analog voltage value and applies the corresponding gray level analog voltage to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Then, the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is energized, is maximized allowing a maximum amount of current to flow through the first route. Accordingly, the maximum amount of current also flows through the second route so that the predetermined maximum gray level may be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> If a predetermined minimum gray level is to be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the current driver unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> converts the digital value of, for example, &lsquo;00000000&rsquo; into a corresponding gray level analog voltage value and applies the corresponding gray level analog voltage value to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Then, the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned off, e.g., placed in a floating state, such that no current flows through either the first or second routes so that the predetermined minimum gray level may be displayed by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The gate driver unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> outputs a series of control signals so that the first through last gate lines in the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, in which a plurality of organic electroluminescent devices <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> are arranged, may be sequentially selected to display one frame of a picture on a screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is coupled to the first gate line of the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be energized when the first line is selected by the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, an analog voltage value specific to the organic electroluminescent device may be applied to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by the current driver unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> to control the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is energized. Accordingly, a predetermined amount of current flows through the first and second routes so that a proper gray level may be indicated by the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> After the first gate line has been selected by the gate driver unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, the next consecutive gate line is selected and the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the first gate line are turned off. Accordingly, the gray level of the corresponding organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is maintained by the first capacitor C<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> until the last gate line in the luminescent array unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is selected, thereby displaying one frame of a picture on a screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, as discussed above, the minimum gray level judgment unit <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> may be installed in the current driver unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The minimum gray level judgment unit <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> includes a NOR gate NOR<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> that performs a NOR operation on the digital value of the gray level for the organic electroluminescent device generated by the current driver <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when a digital value of a predetermined minimum gray level of, for example, &lsquo;00000000&rsquo; is inputted, the minimum gray level judgment unit <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> selectively outputs a logical &lsquo;high&rsquo; potential, thereby indicating that the digital value has been determined to be of the predetermined minimum gray level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The NOR gate NOR<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> may be altered using an inverter. Accordingly, the inverter may invert the digital value of the gray level for an organic electroluminescent device outputted from the current driver <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. Further, an AND gate may be added to perform an AND operation on the output of the inverter in order to obtain the same output value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the switching unit <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> selectively supplies a reference current (Iref) to the first route if the NOR gate NOR<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> outputs a logical &lsquo;high&rsquo; potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A method of driving the organic electroluminescent device of the present invention will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, picture data is supplied to the organic electroluminescent device of the luminescent array unit selected by the gate driver unit and the current driver unit is read (step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Next, it is determined whether the read picture data contains a digital value of a predetermined minimum gray level (step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> If the picture data does not contain a digital value of the predetermined minimum gray level, the corresponding organic electroluminescent device luminesces using a current received from the current driver unit. If, however, the picture data does contain a digital value of the predetermined minimum gray level, the corresponding organic electroluminescent device receives no current from the current driver unit. However, a reference current is supplied to the corresponding organic electroluminescent device (step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when an organic electroluminescent device displays a predetermined gray level in a first frame of a picture and then displays the predetermined minimum gray level in a second, consecutive, frame, the reference voltage (Vref) may be supplied to the first route so that the organic electroluminescent device can display the predetermined gray level and then immediately display the minimum gray level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary view of a driving apparatus of an organic electroluminescent device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, when the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> displays a predetermined gray level, the current driver <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> may be connected to the organic electroluminescent device driving circuit via the switching unit <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>, and the third and fourth PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. An analog voltage corresponding to the digital picture data signal may be applied to the gate of the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to control the degree to which the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is energized. Accordingly, the current flowing to the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> may be controlled as required such that a predetermined gray level is displayed by the organic electroluminescent device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> When the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> displays a predetermined gray level, the first NMOS transistor NM<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned off. Further, the current source <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> supplies the reference current (Iref) to the organic electroluminescent device driving circuit via a connection made by the switching unit <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. When the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> displays the predetermined minimum gray level, the first and second PMOS transistors PM<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are turned off and the current flowing to the organic electroluminescent device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is turned off so that the predetermined minimum gray level is displayed by the organic electroluminescent device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> According to the principles of the present invention, when an organic electroluminescent device consecutively displays a predetermined gray level in a first frame and then displays a predetermined minimum gray level in a second frame, a reference voltage or a reference current may be selectively supplied so that the organic electroluminescent device may display the predetermined gray level and then immediately display the predetermined minimum gray level. Accordingly, an accurate gray level may be expressed and the organic electroluminescent devices may be driven with a quick response speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the meets and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such meets and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims. </paragraph>
