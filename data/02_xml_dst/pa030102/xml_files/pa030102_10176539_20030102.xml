<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a spin exciting method, a magnetic resonance imaging method, and a magnetic resonance imaging system. More specifically, it relates to a spin exciting method, a magnetic resonance imaging method, and a magnetic resonance imaging system for producing tomographic images of multiple slices. Herein, spins in an object, in which two kinds of magnetic resonance signals having different frequencies are induced based on chemical shifts, that have one of two peak resonance signals are saturated, and spins that have the other peak resonant frequency are utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, an object of imaging is carried into a bore of a magnet system, that is, an imaging space in which a static magnetic field is created. Magnetic field gradients and a high-frequency magnetic field are applied to the object in order to excite spins in the object. This causes the spins to induce a magnetic resonance (MR) signal. An image is reconstructed based on the received MR signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The MR signal utilized for imaging is induced by spins possessed by protons of hydrogen nuclei. The protons exist in water that is a major component of a living body, and are therefore preferably adopted as a signal source necessary to visualize the living body through magnetic resonance imaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Since protons also exist in fat, fat also induces a magnetic resonance signal. Due to chemical shifts, the frequency of the magnetic resonance signal induced by spins possessed by the protons of fat is different from the frequency of the one induced by spins possessed by the protons of water. The resonant frequency of fat is lower by an equivalent of approximately 3.5 ppm than the resonant frequency of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> By utilizing the difference in a resonant frequency, water alone is visualized but fat is not, or fat alone is visualized but water is not. In order to visualize water alone, processing of preventing fat from inducing a magnetic resonance signal is performed in advance. Moreover, in order to visualize fat alone, processing of preventing water from inducing a magnetic resonance signal is performed in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The processing is referred to as saturation, wherein spins possessed by the protons of fat or water are excited and fully diffused so that the spins will not respond to subsequent excitation. Excitation of spins for saturation is initiated with a radio-frequency (RF) signal whose frequency agrees with the resonant frequency of fat or water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> If a static magnetic field is inhomogeneous in strength from site to site in an imaging space, resonant frequencies of spins possessed by protons are uncertain depending on a site. Depending on the degree of uncertainty, the spins to be used for imaging may be saturated. This effect of the uncertainty gets especially outstanding in multiple slice imaging. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to realize a spin exciting method, a magnetic resonance imaging method, and a magnetic resonance imaging system which make it possible to properly perform multiple slice imaging accompanied by saturation irrespective of inhomogeneity in static magnetic field strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In this specification, spins possessed by protons of water and spins possessed by protons of fat may be referred to as water and fat respectively. Moreover, the frequency of a magnetic resonance signal induced by the spins possessed by the protons of water may be discussed while being replaced with the resonant frequency of water. Likewise, the frequency of a magnetic resonance signal induced by the spins possessed by the protons of fat may be discussed while being replaced with the resonant frequency of fat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In this specification, spins possessed by protons of water and used to visualize water alone and spins possessed by protons of fat and used to visualize fat alone may be referred to as spins to be used for imaging. Moreover, spins possessed by protons of fat and saturated for visualization of water alone, and spins possessed by protons of water and saturated for visualization of fat alone may be referred to as spins to be saturated. The spins to be used for imaging are not limited to the spins possessed by the protons of water or fat but may be spins possessed by any kind of nuclei according to the purpose of imaging. The same applies to the spins to be saturated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> (1) According to one aspect of the present invention for solving the foregoing problem, there is provided a spin exciting method for producing tomographic images of multiple slices of an object, in which two kinds of magnetic resonance signals having different frequencies are induced based on chemical shifts, by saturating spins that have one of two peak resonant frequencies, and by utilizing spins that have the other peak resonant frequency. Herein, an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins at each of slice positions specifying multiple slices is measured. A maximum error is extracted from among errors of peak resonant frequencies with the peak resonant frequencies observed between the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging and the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated. Spins are excited using an exciting signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by adding the maximum value to a theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (2) According to another aspect of the present invention for solving the aforesaid problem, there is provided a magnetic resonance imaging method for producing tomographic images of multiple slices of an object, in which two kinds of magnetic resonance signals having different frequencies are induced based on chemical shifts, by saturating spins that have one of two peak resonant frequencies, and by utilizing spins that have the other peak resonant frequency. Herein, an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins at each of slice positions specifying multiple slices is measured. A maximum value is extracted from among errors of peak resonant frequencies with the peak resonant frequencies observed between the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging and the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated. Spins are excited using an exciting signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by adding the maximum value to a theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. The excited spins are then saturated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (3) According to another aspect of the present invention for solving the aforesaid problem, there is provided a magnetic resonance imaging system for producing tomographic images of multiple slices of an object, in which two kinds of magnetic resonance signals having different frequencies are induced based on chemical shifts, by saturating spins that have one of two peak resonant frequencies, and by utilizing spins that have the other peak resonant frequency. The magnetic resonance imaging system consists mainly of a frequency error measuring means, a maximum value extracting means, an exciting means, and a saturating means. The frequency error measuring means measures an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins at each of slice positions specifying multiple slices. The maximum value extracting means extracts a maximum value from among errors of peak resonant frequencies with the peak resonant frequencies observed between the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging and the peak resonant frequency of spins to be saturated. The exciting means excites spins using an exciting signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by adding the maximum value to a theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. The saturating means saturates the excited spins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the aspects (1) to (3) of the present invention, an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins at each of slice positions specifying multiple slices is measured. A maximum value is extracted from among errors of peak resonant frequencies with the peak resonant frequencies observed between the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging and the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated. Spins are excited using an exciting signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by adding the maximum value to a theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. An adverse effect on the spins to be used for imaging at each of the slice positions specifying multiple slices can be canceled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (4) According to still another aspect of the present invention for solving the aforesaid problem, there is provided a spin exciting method for producing tomographic images of multiple slices of an object, in which two kinds of magnetic resonance signals having different frequencies are induced based on chemical shifts, by saturating spins that have one of two peak resonant frequencies, and by utilizing spins that have the other peak resonant frequency. Herein, an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins at each of slice positions specifying multiple slices is measured. A maximum value is extracted from among errors of peak resonant frequencies with the peak resonant frequencies observed between the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging and the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated. Differences of an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins in each slice from errors of peak resonant frequencies of spins in the other slices are calculated. When one of the differences of the errors of the peak resonant frequencies exceeds a predetermined threshold with the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging between the peak resonant frequencies and the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated, spins are excited using an exciting signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by subtracting the threshold from a value calculated by adding the maximum value to a theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. When none of the differences exceeds the threshold, spins are excited using an exciting signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by adding an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins in a slice concerned to a theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. </paragraph>

When one of the differences of the errors of the peak resonant frequencies exceeds a predetermined threshold with the peak resonant frequencies observed between the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging and the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated, spins are excited using an exciting signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by subtracting the threshold from a value calculated by adding the maximum value to a theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. When none of the differences exceeds the threshold, an exciting signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by adding an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins in a slice concerned to the theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. The excited spins are then saturated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (6) According to another aspect of the present invention for solving the aforesaid problem, there is provided a magnetic resonance imaging system for producing tomographic images of multiple slices of an object, in which two kinds of magnetic resonance signals having different frequencies are induced based on chemical shifts, by saturating spins that have one of two resonant frequencies and by utilizing spins that have the other resonant frequency.

The difference calculating means calculates differences of an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins in each slice from errors of peak resonant frequencies of spins in the other slices. When one of the differences of the errors of the peak resonant frequencies exceeds a predetermined threshold with the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging between the peak resonant frequencies and the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated, the exciting means excites spins using an exciting signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by subtracting the threshold from a value calculated by adding the maximum value to a theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift.

The saturating means saturates the excited spins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the aspects (4) to (6) of the present invention, an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins at each of slice positions specifying multiple slices is measured. A maximum value is extracted from among errors of peak resonant frequencies with the peak resonant frequencies observed between the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging and the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated. Differences of an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins in each slice from errors of peak resonant frequencies of spins in the other slices are calculated. When one of the differences of the errors of the peak resonant frequencies exceed a predetermined threshold with the peak resonant frequencies observed between the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging and the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated, spins are excited using an exciting signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by subtracting the threshold from a value calculated by adding the maximum value to the theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. When none of the differences exceeds the threshold, spins are excited using an excising signal whose frequency deviates from the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging towards the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated by an equivalent of a value calculated by adding an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins in a slice concerned to the theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. Consequently, an adverse effect on the spins to be used for imaging at each of slice positions specifying multiple slices can be minimized while saturation can be achieved fully. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention will be detailed with reference to drawings below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. The MRI system is an example of the embodiment of the present invention. The configuration of the MRI system represents the example of the embodiment of the present invention. The actions of the MRI system represent a method implemented in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, the MRI system includes a magnet system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The magnet system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a main magnetic coil assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a gradient coil assembly <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and a radio-frequency (RF) coil assembly <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. These coil assemblies are generally shaped cylindrically and arranged coaxially. An object of imaging <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is carried into or out of a substantially cylindrical internal space (bore) of the magnet system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by means of a transporting means that is not shown while lying down on a cradle <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The main magnetic coil assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> creates a static magnetic field in the internal space of the magnet system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The direction of the static magnetic field is substantially parallel to the direction of the body axis of the object <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The static magnetic field is a so-called horizontal magnetic field. The main magnetic coil assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is realized with, for example, a superconductor. Needless to say, the main coil assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is not limited to the superconductor but may be realized with a normal conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The gradient coil assembly <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> generates three magnetic field gradients that produce gradients in static magnetic field strength along each of three mutually perpendicular axes, that is, a slice-selecting axis, a phase-encoding axis, and a frequency-encoding axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the coordinate axes that are mutually perpendicular in the space of a static magnetic field are x, y, and z axes, any of the axes may be regarded as the slice-selecting axis. One of the other two axes is regarded as the phase-encoding axis, and the other axis is regarded as the frequency-encoding axis. The slice-selecting axis, phase-encoding axis, and frequency-encoding axis may be inclined arbitrarily with respect to the x, y, and z axes respectively while being perpendicular to one another. In the present MRI system, the direction of the body axis of the object <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is regarded as the direction of the z axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A magnetic field gradient oriented in the direction of the slice-selecting axis may be referred to as a slice-selecting magnetic field gradient. A magnetic field gradient oriented in the direction of the phase-encoding axis may be referred to as a phase-encoding magnetic field gradient. A magnetic field gradient oriented in the direction of the frequency-encoding axis may be referred to as a readout magnetic field gradient. For generation of the magnetic field gradients, the gradient coil assembly <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has three gradient coils that are not shown.

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Imaging to be performed by the MRI system will be described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> schematically shows an example of a pulse sequence to be used to acquire an MR signal in the MRI system shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The pulse sequence is used to acquire a gradient echo, that is, devised based on a gradient echo imaging technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) shows RF pulses, (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) shows slice-selecting magnetic field gradients Gs, (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) shows readout magnetic field gradients Gr, (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) shows phase-encoding magnetic field gradients Gp, and (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) shows MR signals MR. The pulse sequence progresses from left to right along a time axis t in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, spins are excited with application of an RF pulse RF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At this time, none of the magnetic field gradients is applied. Namely, non-selective excitation is carried out. The non-selective excitation is intended to excite spins to be saturated. An RF pulse whose frequency is the same as the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated is employed. For example, in order to visualize water, an RF pulse whose frequency is agreed with the resonant frequency of fat is employed. In order to visualize fat, an RF pulse whose frequency is agreed with the resonant frequency of water is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The frequency of the RF pulse RF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is predetermined to agree with the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be saturated. The way of determining the frequency of the RF pulse RF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Assuming that water is visualized, an RF pulse whose frequency agrees with the resonant frequency of fat is adopted as the RF pulse RF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in order to excite the spins in fat. At this time, the RF pulse serving as an exciting pulse is, for example, a 90&deg; pulse. Hereinafter, the RF pulse RF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be referred to as a saturation pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> After the RF pulse RF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is applied for excitation, the slice-selecting magnetic field gradient Gs<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, readout magnetic field gradient Gr<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, and phase-encoding magnetic field gradient Gp<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> are applied in order to diffuse the spins in fat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> After the spins in fat are diffused, an RF pulse RF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is applied for excitation. An RF pulse whose frequency agrees with the resonant frequency of water is adopted as the RF pulse RF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order to excite water. At this time, the RF pulse serving as an exciting pulse is an &agr;&deg; (&lE;90&deg;) pulse. The resonant frequency of water is determined with a static magnetic field strength and a gyromagnetic ratio. The frequency of the RF pulse RF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is agreed with the resonant frequency of water. Hereinafter, the RF pulse RF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be referred to as an &agr;&deg; pulse. When the &agr;&deg; pulse is applied for excitation, the slice-selecting magnetic field gradient Gs<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is applied for the purpose of selective excitation that is intended to excite spins in a predetermined slice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The excited spins induce a free induction decay (FID) signal. Since fat is saturated, no FID signal is induced in fat. The FID signal is therefore induced in water alone. The FID signal is received as FID data by the data acquisition unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> via the RF coil assembly <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>&prime;). The FID data is, as described later, used to calculate an error of a peak resonant frequency of spins lying at a slice position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> After the FID signal decays, the phase-encoding magnetic field gradient Gp<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is applied in order to perform phase encoding on spins lying in the direction of the phase-encoding axis. Moreover, a readout magnetic field gradient Gr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is applied in order to dephase spins lying in the direction of the frequency-encoding axis. Thereafter, a readout magnetic field gradient Gr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is applied in order to rephase the spins. This results in a gradient echo GR. Since fat is saturated, the gradient echo GR is induced in water alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The gradient echo GR is an RF signal having a waveform symmetrical with respect to the middle of production of an echo. The middle of production of an echo comes in an echo time (TE) after excitation with the &agr;&deg; pulse. The gradient echo GR is acquired as view data by the data acquisition unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> via the RF coil assembly (<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>&prime;). After the acquisition of view data is completed, the phase-encoding magnetic field gradient Gp<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is applied in order to perform phase-encoding in a direction in which a coil would trace if it were rewound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The pulse sequence is repeated in cycles of a repetition time TR while slice positions are sequentially changed. In order to change slice positions, regions in which spins are excited during selective excitation are changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The pulse sequence is repeated, for example, 64 times to 256 times for each slice. At each time of repetition, the phase-encoding magnetic field gradients Gp<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Gp<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be oriented in the direction of the phase-encoding axis has the strength thereof changed. Horizontal lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> conceptually express a sequential change in the strength of the phase-encoding magnetic field gradient. Consequently, 64 to 256 view data items are acquired from each slice at different phases of the slice in the direction of the phase-encoding axis. The thus acquired view data items are stored in the k-space in the memory included in the data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> in association with slice positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The data in the k-space is subjected to two-dimensional inverse Fourier transform, whereby two-dimensional image data of each slice in an actual space, that is, reconstructed images of multiple slices are produced. The images depict water alone because fat is saturated. The reconstructed images are displayed on the display device <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and stored in the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Talking of the pulse sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, needless to say, the saturation pulse RF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be a saturation pulse to be used to saturate water. The &agr;&deg; pulse RF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be an &agr;&deg; exciting pulse to be used to excite spins in fat. In this case, fat is visualized on behalf of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A description will be made of a frequency determining method for the saturation pulse RF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is implemented in order to adopt an imaging technique accompanied by saturation like the aforesaid one. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flowchart describing imaging that is performed by the MRI system and involves data processing needed to determine the frequency of the saturation pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As described, at step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, a variation of a peak resonant frequency of spins in each slice, deltaB0(k), is measured. Herein, k denotes a slice number (k&equals;1 to N). The number of views per slice shall be V. In this specification, the variation of a peak resonant frequency, deltaB0(k), is referred to as an error of a peak resonant frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The measurement of the error of a peak resonant frequency, deltaB0(k), is achieved by detecting an error of a peak resonant frequency of an FID signal, which is induced in water and acquired by adopting the pulse sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for each slice, relative to a predetermined center frequency. The predetermined center frequency is determined with a product of a static magnetic field strength (B0) at the center of the magnet system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by a gyromagnetic ratio (&ggr;) . The center frequency is an example of the peak resonant frequency of the spins to be used for imaging employed in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> conceptually shows the error of a peak resonant frequency deltaB0(k). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the number of slices N is 3. Profiles wat<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, wat<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and wat<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> portray the spectra of resonant frequencies of spins in water in slices <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> respectively. Profiles fat<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, fat<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and fat <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> portray the spectra of resonance frequencies of spins in water in slices <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> respectively. Incidentally, as the axis of frequencies goes left to right, the resonant frequency gets higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> There is a difference stemming from a chemical shift between a peak observed on a profile wat and a peak observed on a profile fat. The difference is theoretically fixed, and is different by approximately 3.5 ppm from the peak on the profile wat. The difference is tentatively set to 50 Hz. In this specification, the difference may be referred to as a theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, the peak on the profile wat<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> portraying the spectrum of resonant frequencies of spins in slice <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is higher by 5 Hz than the center frequency, and expressed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>deltaB0(1)&equals;&plus;5 Hz </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The peak on the profile wat<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> portraying the spectrum of resonant frequencies of spins in slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is lower by 10 Hz than the center frequency and expressed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>deltaB0(2)&equals;&minus;10 Hz </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The peak on the profile wat<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> portraying the spectrum of resonant frequencies of spins in slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is higher by 20 Hz than the center frequency and expressed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>deltaB0(3)&equals;&plus;20 Hz </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The error of a peak resonant frequency of spins in each slice, deltaB0(k), is attributable to inhomogeneity of static magnetic field strength that varies depending on a site. The error of a peak resonant frequency of spins in each slice, deltaB0(k), is measured at step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> performs the measurement of the error of a peak resonant frequency deltaB0(k) . The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is an example of a frequency error measuring means employed in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, the frequency of a saturation pulse is determined. For the determination of the frequency, a value calculated by adding a difference in a resonant frequency between fat and water to a minimum value among errors of peak resonant frequencies, deltaB0(k) where k denotes 1 to n, to the saturation pulse is adopted for a saturation pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, a minimum value is detected from among the errors of peak resonant frequencies of spins in all slices, deltaB0(k). When it says that an error of a peak resonant frequency assumes the minimum value, it means that the peak resonant frequency most greatly deviates from the center frequency while being lower than that. In other words, the peak resonant frequency is the lowest among the peak resonant frequencies of spins in all the slices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the error of the peak resonant frequency of spins in slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, deltaB0(2)&equals;&minus;10 Hz, meets the above condition. Therefore, 10 is extracted as the minimum value. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> performs the extraction of the minimum value. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is an example of a maximum value extracting means employed in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A difference in a resonant frequency between fat and water, that is, a theoretical change in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift is added to the minimum value. A frequency lower by the value from the center frequency is adopted for a saturation pulse. Consequently, the frequency indicated with an arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is adopted as the frequency of the saturation pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The frequency is the lowest frequency for a saturation pulse among the frequencies therefor adopted for all slices. Therefore, even when a saturation pulse having the frequency is applied to slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> whose spins have a peak resonant frequency that deviates most greatly from the center frequency while being lower than that, fat can be saturated without impairment of an MR signal induced in water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, a count i is initialized to 1. The count i represents the number of counted views. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, a count j is initialized to 1. The count j represents the number of counted slices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, an imaging echo is acquired. Since j equals 1 and i equals 1, the imaging echo is acquired from the first view of the first slice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The acquisition of an imaging echo is achieved using the pulse sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>.

For the frequency determination, a value calculated by adding a difference in a resonant frequency between fat and water to a maximum value out of the errors of peak resonant frequencies, deltaB0(k) (k&equals;1 to N) is adopted for the saturation pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, first, a maximum value is extracted from among the errors of peak resonant frequencies of spins in all slices, deltaB0(k) When it says that an error of a peak resonant frequency assumes the maximum value, it means that the peak resonant frequency deviates most greatly while being higher than the center frequency In other words, the peak resonant frequency is the highest among the peak resonant frequencies of spins in all the slices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the error of the peak resonant frequency of spins in slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, deltaB0(3)&equals;&plus;20 Hz, meets the above condition. Therefore, 20 is extracted as the maximum value. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> performs the extraction of a maximum value. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is an example of a maximum value extracting means employed in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> A difference in a resonant frequency between fat and water, that is, a theoretical change in a peak resonance frequency stemming from a chemical shift is added to the maximum value.

<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The frequency is the highest among the frequencies at which a saturation pulse is applied to all slices. Therefore, even when the saturation pulse having the frequency is applied to slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> whose spins has a peak resonant frequency that deviates most greatly from the center frequency while being higher than that, water in the slice can be saturated without impairment of an MR signal induced in fat therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> After the frequency determination is completed, step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and subsequent steps are carried out. Consequently, tomographic images of multiple slices depicting fat can be produced. Owing to the foregoing saturation, an MR signal induced in fat will not be impaired in any slice.

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flowchart describing a procedure for visualizing water. According to the imaging method described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the frequency of an RF pulse to be applied for saturating fat is shifted based on the maximum value of an error of a peak resonant frequency, which is lower than a center frequency, relative to the center frequency. When an error of a peak resonant frequency differs greatly from slice to slice, fat in some slice may not be saturated satisfactorily. The flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> describes a procedure intended to saturate fat satisfactorily even in such a situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> As described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, at step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, a variation of a peak resonant frequency of spins in each slice, deltaB0(k), is measured. This step is identical to step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Consequently, errors of peak resonant frequencies deltaB0(1), deltaB0(2), and deltaB0(3) are measured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is nearly the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, i and j are incremented by one at steps <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> respectively. These steps are identical to steps <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, at step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, it is judged whether the following condition is met relative to any slice of a slice number k&equals;1 to N: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&minus;(<highlight><italic>deltaB</italic></highlight>0(<highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>)&minus;<highlight><italic>deltaB</italic></highlight>0(<highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>))&gt;<highlight><italic>deltaF </italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> where deltaF represents a predetermined threshold. The threshold is set to, for example, 10. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> resolves the left side of the expression (1). The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is an example of a difference calculating means employed in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Since j equals 1, deltaB0(1) comes to 5. The left side of the expression (1) is solved by sequentially assigning 1 to N to k. This results in 0, 15, or &minus;15. Since 15 is included, the condition (1) is met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, a frequency for a saturation pulse is determined. A value calculated by adding a difference in a resonant frequency between fat and water to a minimum value out of values of deltaB0(k)&plus;deltaF is adopted for the saturation pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, first, a minimum value is extracted from among errors of peak resonant frequencies of spins in all slices. When it says that an error of a peak resonant frequency assumes the minimum value, it means that the peak resonant frequency most greatly deviates from the center frequency while being lower than that. In other words, the peak resonant frequency is the lowest among the peak resonant frequencies of spins in all the slices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the error of the peak resonant frequency of spins in slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, deltaB0(2)&equals;&minus;10, meets the above condition. Therefore, &minus;10 is extracted as the minimum value. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> performs the extraction of a minimum value. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is an example of a maximum value extracting means employed in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> A value calculated by adding deltaF to the above value is still a minimum value. The calculated value is 0. A difference in a resonant frequency between fat and water, that is, a theoretical change (50) in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift is added to the value of 0. A frequency lower by the calculated value from the center frequency is adopted for a saturation pulse. Consequently, the frequency indicated with an arrow painted in black in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is adopted as the frequency of the saturation pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The frequency is closer to the center frequency by the threshold deltaF than the frequency indicated with an arrow drawn with a dashed line is.

For slice <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the frequency is closer to the peak on the profile fat<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> than the frequency indicated with the arrow drawn with a dashed line is, and permits more successful saturation of fat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the above frequency is close to the resonant frequency of water in slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or any other slice whose spins have a peak resonant frequency that deviates most greatly from the center frequency while being lower than the center frequency. For this reason, the frequency may affect visualization of water in slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, when the threshold deltaF is set to a proper value, the adverse effect can be limited to a permissible level. Conversely, the threshold deltaF is determined so that the adverse effect will be confined to the permissible level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, an imaging echo is acquired at step <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. This step is identical to step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, the same processing as the foregoing one is performed on slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Since deltaB0(2) equals &minus;10, the solution of the left side of the expression (1) comes to &minus;15, 0, or &minus;30. The aforesaid condition is therefore not met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Frequency determination is performed at step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. For the frequency determination, a value calculated by adding a difference in a resonant frequency between fat and water to deltaB0(j) is adopted for a saturation pulse. Since j equals 2, deltaB0(2) comes to &minus;10. Therefore, the frequency indicated with an arrow drawn with a dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is adopted as the frequency of a saturation pulse to be applied to slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The frequency agrees with the resonant frequency of fat in slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The frequency is the lowest among the frequencies at which a saturation pulse is applied to all slices.

Since deltaB0(3) equals 20, the solution of the left side of the expression (1) is 15, 30, or 0. The aforesaid condition is therefore met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, a frequency for a saturation pulse is determined in the same manner as the aforesaid one.

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The frequency is closer to the center frequency by a threshold than the frequency indicated with an arrow drawn with a dashed line is. As far as slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is concerned, the frequency is closer to the peak on the profile fat<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> than the frequency indicated with the arrow drawn with the dashed line is.

The flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> describes the procedure for saturating water satisfactorily even in such a situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> As described, at step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime;, a variation of a peak resonant frequency of spins in each slice, deltaB0(k), is measured. This step is identical to step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Consequently, for example, errors of peak resonant frequencies deltaB0(1), deltaB0(2), and deltaB0(3) are obtained as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is almost the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> At steps <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, i and j are initialized to 1. These steps are identical to steps <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, it is judged whether the following condition is met relative to any slice of a slice number k&equals;1 to N: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>deltaB</italic></highlight>0(<highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>)&minus;deltaB0(<highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>))&gt;<highlight><italic>deltaF&prime;</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> where deltaF&prime; denotes a predetermined threshold. The threshold is set to, for example, 10. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> solves the left side of the expression (2). The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is an example of a difference calculating means employed in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Since j equals 1, deltaB0(1) comes to 5. The left side of the expression (2) is solved by assigning 1 to N to k. Consequently, the solution is 0, &minus;15, or 15. Since 15 is included, the above condition is met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>&prime;, a frequency for a saturation pulse is determined. For the frequency determination, a value calculated by adding a difference in a resonant frequency between fat and water to a maximum value out of values of deltaB0(k)&minus;deltaF&prime; is adopted for a saturation pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, first, a maximum value is extracted from among errors of peak resonant frequencies of spins in all slices, deltaB0(k). When it says that a peak resonant frequency most greatly deviates from a center frequency while being higher than that, it means that the peak resonant frequency is the highest among all the resonant frequencies of spins in all the slices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the error of the peak resonant frequency of spins in slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, deltaB0(3)&equals;20, meets the above condition. 20 is extracted as the maximum value. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> performs the extraction of a maximum value. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is an example of a maximum value extracting means employed in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> A value calculated by subtracting deltaF&prime; from the above maximum value is still a maximum value among the errors of the peak resonant frequencies of spins in all slices. The resultant value is 10. A difference in a resonant frequency between fat and water, that is, a theoretical change (50) in a peak resonant frequency stemming from a chemical shift is added to the value (10). A frequency higher by the resultant value from the center frequency is adopted as a frequency for a saturation pulse. Consequently, the frequency indicated with an arrow painted in black in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is adopted as the frequency of the saturation pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The frequency is closer to the center frequency by the threshold deltaF&prime; than the frequency indicated with an arrow drawn with a dashed line is. The frequency is adopted as the frequency of a saturation pulse to be applied to slice <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. For slice <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the frequency is closer to the peak on the profile wat<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> than the frequency indicated with the arrow drawn with a dashed line is. The adoption of the frequency enables more satisfactory saturation of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the frequency is close to the resonant frequency of fat in slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or any other slice whose spins have a peak resonant frequency that most greatly deviates from the center frequency while being higher than that. Application of a saturation pulse having the frequency may affect visualization of fat in slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. However, when the threshold deltaF&prime; is set to a proper value, the adverse effect can be limited to a permissible level. Conversely, the threshold deltaF&prime; is set to a value that limits the adverse effect to the permissible level. The threshold deltaF&prime; need not be the same as the aforesaid threshold deltaF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, an imaging echo is acquired. This step is identical to step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. However, the frequency determined at step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>&prime; is adopted as the frequency of the saturation pulse RF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the first view data of slice <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is acquired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, it is judged whether j&gt;(N&minus;1) is met. If not, j is incremented by one at step <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. These steps are identical to steps <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>&prime;, the above processing is repeated for slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Since deltaB0(2) equals &minus;10, the solution of the left side of the expression (2) is 15, 0, or 30. The aforesaid condition is therefore met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>&prime;, a frequency is determined for a saturation pulse in the same manner as the aforesaid one. Consequently, the frequency indicated with an arrow painted in black in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is adopted as the frequency of a saturation pulse to be applied to slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the frequency is closer to the peak on the profile wat<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> than the frequency indicated with an arrow drawn with a dashed line is. The adoption of the frequency permits satisfactory saturation of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, an imaging echo is acquired. This step is identical to step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. However, the frequency determined at step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>&prime; is adopted as the frequency of the saturation pulse RF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the first view data of slice <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is acquired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, it is judged whether j&gt;(N&minus;1) is met. If not, j is incremented by one at step <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. These steps are identical to steps <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>&prime;, the same processing as the above one is performed on slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Since deltaB0(2) equals &minus;10, the solution of the left side of the expression (2) is &minus;10, &minus;30, or 0. The aforesaid condition is therefore not met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Frequency determination is performed at step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>&prime;. For the frequency determination, a value calculated by adding )a difference in a resonant frequency between fat and water to deltaB0(j) is adopted for a saturation pulse. Since j equals 3, deltaB0(3) comes to 20. Consequently, the frequency indicated with the arrow drawn with a dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is adopted as the frequency of a saturation pulse to be applied to slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The frequency agrees with the resonant frequency of water in slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The frequency is the lowest among the frequencies at which a saturation pulse is applied to all slices. Therefore, even when a saturation pulse having the frequency is applied to slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> whose spins have a peak resonant frequency that most greatly deviates from the center frequency while being higher than that, water can be saturated without impairment of an MR signal included in water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, an imaging echo is acquired. Consequently, the first view data of slice <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is acquired. At step <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, it is judged whether j&gt;(N&minus;1) is met. If not, j is incremented by one at step <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. The same procedure as the above one is repeated. Consequently, the first view data of the fourth slice and thereafter is acquired sequentially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> When the first view data of all slices has been acquired, the condition based on which judgment is made at step <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> is met. At step <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, it is judged whether i&gt;(V&minus;1) is met. If not, i is incremented by one at step <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and control is returned to step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the second view data is acquired from all slices started with slice <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The procedure is repeated, whereby multiple slices are scanned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> After scanning is completed, image reconstruction is performed at step <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, images are displayed and stored. Through steps <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>&prime;, and <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>&prime;, an appropriate frequency is determined for a saturation pulse to be applied to each slice. Consequently, fat in each slice can be visualized successfully. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, control unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, RF drive unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and RF coil assembly <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are involved in excitation with application of an RF pulse intended for saturation. The portion of the MRI system composed of the data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, control unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, RF drive unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and RF coil assembly <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is an example of an exciting means employed in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> After excitation with application of an RF pulse is completed, the magnetic field gradients Gs, Gr, and Gp are applied in order to diffuse spins. Excitation with application of an RF pulse and diffusion result in saturation. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, control unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, RF drive unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, RF coil assembly <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, gradient coil assembly <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and gradient drive unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are involved in the saturation. The portion of the MRI system composed of the data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, control unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, RF drive unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, RF coil assembly <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, gradient coil assembly <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and gradient drive unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is an example of a saturating means employed in the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Frequency error measurement of step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime; may be performed periodically during imaging. Consequently, a time-varying drift in a static magnetic field stemming from a change in ambient temperature can be coped with satisfactorily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Moreover, an appropriate limit may be set for errors of peak resonant frequencies. Preferably, a measured value of an error of a peak resonant frequency exceeding the limit should be invalidated for fear imaging might be affected by a temporal magnetic disorder caused by automobiles or the like that happen to run nearby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described by taking examples.
