<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a front fork for a motor cycle. In particular, it relates to a front fork which sharply increases a damping force in proximity to a maximum compression stroke. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A front fork is such that a tube connected to the vehicle wheels is inserted to slide freely in a tube connected to the vehicle body. These tubes undergo compression or extension operations relative to one another due to vibrations input to the motor cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A front fork as disclosed for example in JP-A7-174179 or JP-A10-103399 generates a strong damping force in proximity to maximum compression during a compression stroke in order to prevent the compressed tubes from colliding with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However this type of front fork may produce a shock since an excessively strong damping force is rapidly produced in proximity to maximum compression. When such a shock is transmitted from the front fork to the vehicle body, the rider receives an unpleasant sensation and thus riding comfort is adversely affected. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a front fork which improves riding comfort by preventing the generation of a shock by gradually increasing the damping force in proximity to maximum compression of a front fork. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve above the object the invention provides a front fork for a motor cycle which comprises a tube connected to a vehicle body; a tube connected to a vehicle-wheel and engaging to slide freely with respect to the vehicle-body tube ; a damper disposed in an interior space between the vehicle-body tube and the vehicle-wheel tube, the damper extending or compressing in response to extension or compression of the tubes; a suspension spring disposed in the interior space between the vehicle-body tube and the vehicle-wheel tube, the suspension spring biased in a direction extending the tubes; a first gas chamber formed in the interior space, and an oil chamber positioned above the first gas chamber and introducing oil from the damper, the oil surface in the oil chamber varying as a result of the compression stroke position of the front fork; a second gas chamber formed in the interior space and connected to the first gas chamber through a orifice; a space A formed between the outer periphery of the suspension spring and the inner periphery of the vehicle-body tube, the space A being closed by enter of the tip of the vehicle-wheel tube, and when the space A is open, oil in the oil chamber flows through the space A; and a hole provided in the first gas chamber, and allowing flow of all oil after the space A is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The details as well as other features and advantages of the invention are set forth in the remainder of the specification and are shown in the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of a front fork according to this invention will be described hereafter referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a tube connected to the vehicle body and reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a tube connected to the vehicle wheels. The tubes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are engaged to slide freely with respect to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> damper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is coaxially disposed in the interior of the vehicle-wheel tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The bottom of the damper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fixed to the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the tip of the piston rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the damper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to an upper section in the vehicle-body tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus when the tubes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> undergo compression or extension relative to one another, the piston rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the damper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also extended or compressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A reservoir R is provided in the vehicle-body tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the vehicle-wheel tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The reservoir R comprises a first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> disposed in an upper section of the tubes and an oil chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disposed in a lower section of the tubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When oil fills the interior of the damper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the piston rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> undergoes a compression operation, the oil in the damper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is discharged to the oil chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the reservoir R. Furthermore when the piston rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> undergoes an extension operation, oil is drawn from the reservoir R into the damper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the position of the oil surface O in the reserve rises and falls corresponding to the displacement amount produced by the piston rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> entering into or withdrawing from the oil in the damper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The capacity of the interior space also varies due to the entry and extension of the vehicle-wheel tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with respect to the vehicle-body tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Consequently the position of the oil surface also varies as a result of this variation in the capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Thus the speed with which the oil surface O undergoes variation is larger than the speed in which the tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rises or falls. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, initially the oil surface O is lower than the tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However when the compression stroke amount of the front fork increases, the oil surface O shifts to a position which is higher than the tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A suspension spring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is interposed between the damper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the upper section in the vehicle-body tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in order to support a load acting on the front fork. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The damper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided with a damper cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a piston <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is connected to a piston (not shown) disposed in the damping cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The top end of the piston rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is threadably connected to a boss <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the center of a cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> connected coaxially to the top of the tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is secured by a lock nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A hollow case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected in a coaxial position to the cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by a screw. The case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is positioned on the outer side of the boss <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at a fixed interval thereto. A stopper member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is engaged to the inner periphery of the upper section of the hollow case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Consequently a second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is partitioned in the interior of the case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by the case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the stopper member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the bottom <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the boss <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Interconnected oil passages <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are respectively formed in the wall of the case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the stopper member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a orifice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is interposed along the oil passages <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is connected to the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the oil passages <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the orifice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The flow amount of gas and oil flowing between the second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is controlled in response to the aperture area of the orifice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A regulating rod <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is inserted to allow free displacement in a vertical direction in the oil passage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the stopper member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in order to regulate the aperture area of the orifice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The aperture area of the orifice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is regulated by the vertical position of the regulating rod <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the orifice displays a variable orifice function. An adjuster <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is threadably connected in a hole formed in the upper section of the cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This adjuster <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be directly connected to the regulating rod <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or may be connected through a spacer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. When the adjuster <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates, the regulating rod <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> displaces in a vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> However in an alternative arrangement, the orifice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be a fixed orifice which does not vary the aperture area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A through hole <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed in the bottom <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. A check valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> allowing outward flow of oil and gas is provided in the outlet face of the through hole <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in order to allow flow only from the second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In this manner, although flow of oil and gas is permitted from the second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through the check valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, flow is not permitted from the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the check valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into the second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A cylindrical member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is engaged at the step portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on the outer lower section of the case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The upper end of the suspension spring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is supported by the lower end of the cylinder member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A first hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided at different vertical positions in the wall of the cylindrical member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A plurality of holes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be provided on the circular periphery of the cylindrical member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the tip of the vehicle-wheel tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rises during a compression stroke in the front fork. However when the tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> reaches the lower end of the cylindrical member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the space A between the inner peripheral face of the vehicle-body tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the outer periphery of the suspension spring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> becomes closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although gas and oil rise upwardly from lower sections during a compression stroke of the front fork, when the space A of the tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is open and the oil surface O of the oil is lower than that position, gas and oil pass through the space A and the vertical holes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> After the space A is closed, the degree of entry of the piston rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is at a maximum and the oil surface O is positioned above the tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, oil passes through both the vertical holes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>However throttle resistance to the passage of oil is increased by an amount corresponding to the closure of the space A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Furthermore the tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rises from the inclined face <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>provided on the case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and reaches the large radius section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight>In this state, the throttle resistance is further increased as a result of the flow of oil passing through the narrow space between the tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In addition, oil passes through the orifice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and flows into the second gas chamber containing gas under pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Consequently, during a compression stroke of the front fork, the sectional surface area of the passage allowing flow of oil is varied by the elevated position of the oil surface O and results in an increase in resistance to oil flow. That is to say, compression resistance is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The operation of the front fork will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When an upward force due to a vibration from the road surface is input while the vehicle is running, the front fork is compressed and the vehicle-wheel tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> displaces upwardly. At this time, the oil surface O in the oil chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> rises with the result that the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is compressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Firstly the resilient function as a gas spring will be described with reference to the compression speed of the front fork under these conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When the compression stroke speed is slow, that is to say, when the compression operation is gentle, the elevation speed of the oil surface O is low and the compression of the gas is also gentle. As a result, although gas flow through the orifice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> from the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, since the speed of gas flow is low, the influence of the throttle resistance is small and the pressure in the second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> increases to substantially the same pressure as the pressure in the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Consequently the resilient characteristics of the gas spring is defined by the large gas chamber capacity comprising the capacity of the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> added to the capacity of second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. This results in low spring characteristics. That is to say, the resilient characteristics of the gas display soft compression characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the compression stroke speed is high, the elevation speed of the oil surface O of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is high and the gas is rapidly compressed. Consequently the flow speed of gas flowing into the second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> from the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is high and the orifice <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> creates a strong resistance. Thus the pressure in the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is conspicuously higher than the pressure in the second gas chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Thus the effective gas chamber capacity for the formation of the resilient characteristics of the gas spring substantially corresponds only to the first gas chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, that is to say, the overall capacity is reduced. As a result, the spring characteristics are increased and the resilient characteristics of the gas spring display hard compression characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown above, the resilient characteristics of the gas spring can vary the spring characteristics in response to the compression stroke speed of the front fork. That is to say, when the compression speed is low, the gas displays soft resilient characteristics. When the compression speed is high, hard resilient characteristics result. As a result, the front fork provides high stability and riding comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Next the damping characteristics when the compression stroke of the front fork is large will be described with reference to the stroke position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> With respect to either gentle compression or rapid compression of the front fork, when the compression stroke amount is large, the oil surface O rises in the first gas chamber and the surface area of the passage allowing oil flow varies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when the space A is open, the cross-sectional surface area of the passage when oil shifts upwardly takes a maximum value. When the tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rises and the space A is closed, oil displaces through the first hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Consequently the cross-sectional area of the oil passage is decreased and throttle resistance is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the compression stroke amount is large and the tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> enters the narrow space provided between the outer periphery of the large radius section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the case <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the inner periphery of the tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the passage for oil becomes sharply decreased and a large throttle resistance is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When the compression stroke amount of the front fork increases, the throttle resistance to oil gradually increases as a result. This takes the form of a compression repulsive force on the front fork and produces a large damping force in proximity to maximum compression. In this case, since the damping force for the compression gradually increases, it is possible to avoid generating a shock in proximity to maximum compression and to avoid adverse effects on riding comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> This invention is not limited to the above embodiments, various modifications being possible by those skilled in the art within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
