<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to cell sampling devices and more particularly, to a new and improved device for collecting cellular specimens from biological tissue surfaces and which is suitably adapted for collecting cellular and DNA specimens from the vagina and cervix of the female reproductive tract. The device can be self-administered by a female gynecological patient and includes a cell-collecting insert which in typical use is discharged from a tubular housing into the vagina and expands into a generally spherical or other geometrical configuration for contacting the upper vaginal and lower cervical walls of the patient&apos;s reproductive tract. The insert is maintained in position for a selected period of time to collect cells from the vagina and cervix, after which the insert is removed from the vagina, and the cell samples collected thereon are removed and tested for various medical conditions such as cancer or sexually-transmitted diseases or cytological or DNA aberrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The most common method of retrieving upper vaginal and cervical cell and DNA specimens requires a visit to a physician&apos;s office for a speculum-guided pelvic exam. The facility for retrieving such specimens in a home setting, on the other hand, would have multiple uses including, but not limited to, cytologic studies and DNA analysis. Such a technique would afford privacy to patients and result in increased compliance with recommendations for periodic medical evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Various types of devices for retrieving tissue or cell samples are known in the art and typical of these devices are those detailed in the following U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 4,633,886, dated Jan. 6, 1987, to Bucaro, Jr., U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,921, dated Aug. 7, 1990, to Okimoto; U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,316, dated Feb. 25, 1992, to Monthony, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,992, dated Aug. 3, 1993, to Leon; U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,164, dated Aug. 29, 1995, to Worthen, et al; U.S. Pat. No. 6,155,990, dated Dec. 5, 2000, to Fournier; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,293, dated Jan. 16, 2001, to Buck, et al. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the drawings, an illustrative embodiment of the device for collecting cellular and DNA specimens, hereinafter referred to as the device, of this invention is generally illustrated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes an elongated, hollow plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, typically constructed of paper or plastic, in non-exclusive particular, and having a front opening <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a rear opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which communicate with a housing interior <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). A plunger <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, typically having an elongated plunger shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and terminated on the rear end thereof by a plunger base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> fitted with a plunger flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, is slidably disposed in the housing interior <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, with the typically rounded front end <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the plunger shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> inserted in the rear opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A cell-collecting insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, shown in the functional, expanded configuration in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, typically includes multiple, generally teardrop-shaped insert panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the apices of which are sewn or otherwise attached to each other at a central attachment point <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and extend outwardly therefrom in a compact, generally spherical array. The insert panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be constructed of any suitable flexible material having an expandable &ldquo;memory&rdquo;, including nylon and cellulose, in non-exclusive particular. A retrieval stem <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, such as nylon twine, in non-exclusive particular, may be attached to the insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for purposes hereinafter described. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is normally confined in a compressed configuration in the housing interior <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, with at least a portion of the retrieval stem <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> typically extending through and captured in a central opening (not illustrated) provided in the front end <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the plunger shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In typical use of the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as hereinafter described, the retrieval stem <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be useful for a female patient&apos;s retrieving the expanded insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, released from the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, from the vaginal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) of her reproductive tract after use of the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> of the drawings, in typical application of the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a gynecological patient initially inserts the front opening <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> end of the elongated plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into the vaginal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of her reproductive tract, with the plunger <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extending from the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> disposed in the compressed configuration in the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the vaginal wall <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> partially grips the outside surface of the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The patient then discharges the cell-collecting insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, initially confined in the compressed configuration inside the housing interior <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, from the housing interior <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the front opening <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by applying forward pressure against the plunger flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> until the plunger base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> contacts the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Accordingly, as the front end <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the forwardly-advancing plunger shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> pushes the compressed insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the housing interior <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the front opening <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the flexible insert panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> expand outwardly to define the generally spherical insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and the expanded insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> contacts substantially the entire diameter of both the circular upper vaginal wall <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as well as the lower cervical wall <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the patient&apos;s reproductive tract. The patient then grasps and pulls the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rearwardly to remove the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and plunger <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, nested in the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, from the vaginal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and advance the retrieval stem <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the central front opening (not illustrated) in the front end <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the plunger shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. After the plunger housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is completely removed from the vaginal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the extending end of the retrieval stem <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> typically releases from the tapered front end <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the plunger <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and partially protrudes from the vaginal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as further illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. As the expanded insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> remains in position against the upper vaginal wall <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the lower cervical wall <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for a selected period of time, typically about eight hours or overnight, vaginal and cervical cells (not illustrated) as well as loose DNA from the upper vaginal wall <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the lower cervical wall <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> become detached from the vaginal wall <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and cervical wall <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and are trapped on the insert panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At the end of the application period, the retrieval stem <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be grasped and pulled to retrieve the easily collapsible insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the vaginal opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, after which the insert <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is typically placed in a suitable sample container (not illustrated) for transport to an appropriate medical facility. The vaginal and cervical cells, collected on the insert panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, are removed therefrom by means known to those skilled in the art and subjected to various cytologic studies and DNA analysis for the detection of various medical conditions such as cancer, sexually transmitted diseases and abnormal vaginal and cervical cytology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the device for collecting cellular and DNA specimens of this invention is capable of contacting a large surface area of the vaginal and cervical wall to collect cells and DNA samples from these areas for cytological or chromosomal analysis. The various components of the device can be constructed in different sizes, and the expandible insert component of the device can be constructed in any size and geometrical shape which facilitates a large surface area of contact between the insert and the cellular surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been described above, it will be recognized and understood that various modifications can be made in the invention and the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications which may fall within the spirit and scope of the invention.</paragraph>
