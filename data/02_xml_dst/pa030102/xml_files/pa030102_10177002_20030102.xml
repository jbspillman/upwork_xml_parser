<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a new oxidation colorant for coloring keratin-containing fibers which contains a combination of at least one 4,5-diaminopyrazole derivative as primary intermediate and at least one halogenated m-aminopenol as secondary intermediate and to a process for coloring keratin fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Nowadays, human hair is treated in many different ways with hair-care preparations. Such treatments include, for example, the cleaning of hair with shampoos, the care and regeneration of hair with rinses and conditioners and the bleaching, coloring and shaping of hair with coloring and tinting formulations, wave formulations and styling preparations. Among these, formulations for modifying or shading the color of the hair occupy a prominent position. Conventional hair colorants are formulated either on the basis of oxidation dyes or on the basis of substantive dyes according to the required color or the permanence thereof. In many cases, combinations of oxidation dyes and substantive dyes are also used to obtain special shades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Colorants or tints containing substantive dyes as their coloring component are normally used for temporary colors. Substantive dyes are based on dye molecules which are directly absorbed onto the hair and do not require an oxidative process for developing the color. Dyes such as these include, for example, henna which has been used since ancient times for coloring the body and hair. Corresponding colors are generally far more sensitive to shampooing than the oxidative colors so that an often unwanted change of shade or even a visible &ldquo;decoloration&rdquo; then occurs very much more quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> So-called oxidation colorants are used for permanent, intensive colors with corresponding fastness properties. Oxidation colorants normally contain oxidation dye precursors, so-called primary intermediates and secondary intermediates. The primary intermediates form the actual dyes with one another or by coupling with one or more secondary intermediates under the influence of oxidizing agents or atmospheric oxygen. Oxidation colorants are distinguished by excellent long-lasting coloring results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Good oxidation dye precursors are expected to satisfy above all the following requirements: they must form the required color tones with sufficient intensity and fastness during the oxidative coupling reaction. In addition, they must be readily absorbed onto the fibers with no significant differences&mdash;particularly in the case of human hair&mdash;between damaged and freshly regrown hair (levelling behavior). They are expected to be fast to light, heat and the effect of chemical reducing agents, for example permanent wave lotions. Finally, if they are used to color hair, they should not overly stain the scalp and, above all, should be toxicologically and dermatologically safe. It is also of advantage if the substances are readily soluble in various basic formulations. In addition, the color obtained, for example by blonding, should be easily removable from the hair if it does not meet the individual wishes of the user and is to be taken out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In general, natural hair colors cannot be obtained with a primary intermediate alone or with a special secondary intermediate/primary intermediate combination. In practice, therefore, combinations of various primary intermediates and/or secondary intermediates are used. In addition, substantive dyes are often used for shading purposes. Accordingly, there is a constant demand for new improved dye combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The problem addressed by the present invention, therefore, was to provide new combinations of dye precursors which would be suitable for use in colorants and which would meet the requirements they are expected to satisfy to a particular degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It has now surprisingly been found that combinations of special halogenated m-aminophenols as secondary intermediates with 4,5-diaminopyrazoles as primary intermediates meet the requirements oxidation colorants are expected to satisfy to a particularly high degree. Thus, brilliant, very intensive color tones in the red and magenta range which are extremely fast to light and washing are obtained using these secondary intermediates with, for example, 4,5-diamino-1-(2&prime;-hydroxyethyl)-pyrazole as primary intermediate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The use of 4,5-diaminopyrazole derivatives as primary intermediates in hair colorants is described, for example, in EP-B1-0 740 931. The use of other derivatives is known from WO 94108970 A1, WO 94/08969 A1 and DE 38 43 892 A1. The halogenated m-aminophenols used in the present invention are described as secondary intermediates in hair colorants in DE 196 07 158 A1 and DE 197 17 293 A1. However, these documents do not point to the excellent coloring properties of the combinations of 4,5-diaminopyrazoles with the special halogenated m-aminophenols according to the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The oxidation dye precursors or the substantive dyes do not have to be single compounds. On the contrary, other components may be present in small quantities in the hair colorants according to the invention due to the processes used to produce the individual dyes providing these other components do not adversely affect the coloring result or have to be ruled out for other reasons, for example toxicological reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> So far as the dyes suitable for use in the hair colorants and tinting compositions according to the invention are concerned, reference is also expressly made to the work by Ch. Zviak, The Science of Hair Care, Chapter 7 (pages 248-250; substantive dyes) and Chapter 8, pages 264-267; oxidation dye precursors), published as Volume 7 of the Series &ldquo;Dermatology&rdquo; (Ed.: Ch. Culnan and H. Maibach), Marcel Dekker Inc., New York/Basel, 1986, and to the &ldquo;Europ&auml;ische Inventar der Kosmetik-Rohstoffe&rdquo; published by the Europ&auml;ische Gemeinschaft and available on floppy disk from the Bundesverband Deutscher Industrie- und Handelsunternehmen f&uuml;r Arzneimittel, Reformwaren und K&ouml;rperpflegemittel d.V., Mannheim. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Hair colorants are normally adjusted to a mildly acidic to alkaline pH, i.e. to a pH of about 5 to 11, particularly where coloring is carried out oxidatively with atmospheric oxygen or other oxidizing agents, such as hydrogen peroxide. To this end, the colorants contain alkalizing agents, normally alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, ammonia or organic amines. Preferred alkalizing agents are monoethanolamine, monoisopropanolamine, 2-amino-2-methylpropanol, 2-amino-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol, 2-amino-2-ethylpropane-1,3-diol, 2-amino-2-methylbutanol and triethanolamine and alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides. Within this group, monoethanolamine, triethanolamine and 2-amino-2-methylpropanol and 2-amino-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol are preferred. &ohgr;-Amino acids, such as &ohgr;-aminocaproic acid, may also be used as alkalizing agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> To form the actual hair colors from the oxidation dye precursors, typical oxidizing agents such as, in particular, hydrogen peroxide or adducts thereof with urea, melamine or sodium borate may be used. However, oxidation with atmospheric oxygen as sole oxidizing agent may be preferred. Oxidation may also be carried out with enzymes. In this case, the enzymes may be used both to produce oxidizing per compounds and to enhance the effect of an oxidizing agent present in small quantities. Thus, the enzymes (enzyme class 1: oxidoreductases) are capable of transferring electrons from suitable primary intermediates (reducing agents) to atmospheric oxygen. Preferred enzymes are oxidases, such as tyrosinase and laccase, although glucoseoxidase, uricase or pyruvate oxidase may also be used. Mention is also made of the procedure whereby the effect of small quantities (for example 1% and less, based on the composition as a whole) of hydrogen peroxide is strengthened by peroxidases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The preparation of the oxidizing agent is preferably mixed with the preparation of the oxidation dye precursors immediately before coloring of the hair. The ready-to-use hair coloring preparation formed should preferably have a pH value in the range from 6 to 10. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the hair colorant is used in a mildly alkaline medium. The application temperatures may be in the range from 15 to 40&deg; C. but are preferably at the temperature of the scalp. After a contact time of about 5 to 45 and preferably 15 to 30 minutes, the hair colorant is removed from the hair to be colored by rinsing. There is no need for the hair to be washed with a shampoo where a carrier of high surfactant content, for example a coloring shampoo, has been used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the particular case of hair which is difficult to color, the preparation containing the oxidation dye precursors may be applied to the hair without preliminary mixing with the oxidation component. The oxidation component is applied after a contact time of 20 to 30 minutes, optionally after rinsing. After another contact time of 10 to 20 minutes, the hair is rinsed and, if desired, shampooed. In a first variant of this embodiment where the preliminary application of the dye precursors is intended to improve penetration into the hair, the corresponding formulation is adjusted to a pH value of about 4 to 7. In a second variant, oxidation with air is initially carried out, the formulation applied preferably having a pH value of 7 to 10. In the subsequent accelerated post-oxidation phase, it can be of advantage to use acidified peroxydisulfate solutions as the oxidizing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Whichever of the processes mentioned above is used to apply the colorant according to the invention, development of the color may be supported and enhanced by adding certain metal ions to the colorant. Examples of such metal ions are Zn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Cu<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Fe<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Fe<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Mn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Mn<highlight><superscript>4&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Li<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Mg<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> and Al<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight>. Zn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Cu<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> and Mn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> are particularly suitable. Basically, the metal ions may be used in the form of a physiologically compatible salt. Preferred salts are the acetates, sulfates, halides, lactates and tartrates. Development of the hair color can be accelerated and the color tone can be influenced as required through the use of these metal salts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> To produce the colorants according to the invention, the oxidation dye precursors are incorporated in a suitable water-containing carrier. For coloring hair, such carriers are, for example, creams, emulsions, gels or even surfactant-containing foaming solutions, for example shampoos, foam aerosols or other formulations suitable for application to the hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The colorants according to the invention may also contain any of the known active substances, additives and auxiliaries typical of such formulations. In many cases, the colorants contain at least one surfactant, both anionic and zwitterionic, ampholytic, nonionic and cationic surfactants being suitable in principle. In many cases, however, it has been found to be of advantage to select the surfactants from anionic, zwitterionic or nonionic surfactants. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The compounds containing alkyl groups used as surfactants may be single compounds. In general, however, these compounds are produced from native vegetable or animal raw materials so that mixtures with different alkyl chain lengths dependent upon the particular raw material are obtained. </paragraph>

Products with a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; homolog distribution are mixtures of homologs which are obtained in the reaction of fatty alcohol and alkylene oxide using alkali metals, alkali metal hydroxides or alkali metal alcoholates as catalysts. By contrast, narrow homolog distributions are obtained when, for example, hydrotalcites, alkaline earth metal salts of ether carboxylic acids, alkaline earth metal oxides, hydroxides or alcoholates are used as catalysts. The use of products with a narrow homolog distribution can be of advantage. </paragraph>
