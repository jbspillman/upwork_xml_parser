<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to illumination systems for projection devices and, in particular, relates to scrolling color sequential projection devices, e.g., scrolling color sequential projection devices employing liquid crystal panels. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Color sequential systems are widely used in the projection industry. Every single chip DLP projector has a color wheel, which is commercially available as an off-the-shelf unit. Typically, the color wheel is located at the hot spot of the lamp where the size of the light spot is the smallest. This location provides the fastest color change for the entire panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Liquid crystal displays and, in particular, LCoS displays cannot operate as fast as DLP displays. This slower operation is associated with the liquid crystal relaxation time and leads to a significant reduction of projection system efficiency. To increase the light efficiency of the system, it has been suggested to change colors not frame by frame but row by row. This progressive row-at-a-time way of operating a color sequential system substantially doubles the light output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One example of the application of color sequential illumination to a projection device employing a liquid crystal panel appears in U.S. Pat. No. 6,266,105 B1 (the &apos;105 patent), which was published as EPO Patent Publication No. EP 0 977 422 A2 on Feb. 2, 2000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the present invention, the system disclosed in the &apos;105 patent employs reflective, as opposed to transmissive, color filters. As discussed in Brennesholtz, Matthew S., &ldquo;Color-Sequential LCoS Projector with a Rotating Drum&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>SID </italic></highlight>2002, Paper 51.4, pp. 1346-1349, 2002, reflective color filters of the type disclosed in the &apos;105 patent suffer from poor efficiency and colorimetry. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, the present invention is directed to providing color sequential illumination systems (color scanning systems) which are capable of scrolling bands of colored light across the surface of a panel, e.g., across the surface of a liquid crystal panel such as a LCoS panel. In particular, the present invention is directed to providing scrolling illumination systems which are simple to construct and operate and which achieve sufficiently high levels of color separation between color bands to produce high quality projected images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a first aspect, the invention provides apparatus for producing scrolling bands of colored light (e.g., bands <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (a) an assembly (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) adapted to be rotated about an axis (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>), said assembly comprising a plurality of transmissive color filters (e.g., <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) which extend along the axis and define an internal volume (<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>), a periphery (<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>), and two opposing ends (<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (b) a reflecting surface (<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>) located at least partially within the internal volume (<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>) for receiving light which has passed through the periphery (<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>) and reflecting said light out of one of said ends (<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>), said reflecting surface (<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>) being adapted to remain stationary as the assembly (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) rotates about the axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with other aspects, the invention provides a scrolling method comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (a) providing a plurality of color filters (e.g., <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>), each filter producing transmitted light from received light; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (b) repetitively passing the filters in front of a light source (e.g., <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) by transporting the filters in a substantially circular path about a rotation axis (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>), said light source having an optical axis (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>) which is substantially perpendicular to said rotation axis (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (c) turning the optical axis of the transmitted light produced by the filters so that said axis (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) does not pass through a filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Additional features and advantages of the invention are set forth in the detailed description which follows, and in part will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from that description or recognized by practicing the invention as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are merely exemplary of the invention, and are intended to provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the invention as it is claimed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the present invention is directed to Illumination systems which provide scrolling progressive color change, e.g., row-by-row color change, on a liquid crystal panel, such as a LCoS panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The systems use transmissive color filters (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) which form an assembly (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) which is rotated about a rotation axis (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>). Incident light from a light source (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) passes through the filters and reflects from a reflecting surface (<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>). As a result of this reflection, the system&apos;s optical axis is turned from an orientation substantially perpendicular to the rotation axis to an orientation which does not intersect a filter. Such turning of the optical axis allows colored light to be easily removed from the assembly and avoids problems with color mixing at boundaries between filters as occurs for systems in which light passes through two filters. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,361,172 which was published as PCT Patent Publication No. WO 01/72047 on Sep. 27, 2001. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A layout of the illumination system of the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As illustrated in this figure, the system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a lamp <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, an integrator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (see Apparatus For Uniformly Illuminating a Light Valve, U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,738 dated Apr. 29, 1997), a rotatable assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and an optical relay <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The lamp <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has an elliptical reflector, which focuses the light on the entrance window of the integrator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The relay <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> creates an image of the uniformly illuminated integrator exit window on the active area of the panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The optical relay shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can include various conventional components of an illumination system, such as a UV filter, a cold mirror, and/or a polarization conversion system. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,157. One or more of these components can, of course, be placed in other portions of the system besides the relay. Also, the components are optional and can be omitted if desired. Similarly, additional components can be included in the system without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, rotatable assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is designed to be rotated around an axis <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> parallel to the long side of the integrator exit window. The outer periphery <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the rotatable assembly is preferably located near the integrator exit window at a distance just large enough for mechanical clearance between the integrator and the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Reflecting surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> can be, for example, the front surface of a mirror or the diagonal of a prism at which total internal reflection takes place. Prisms are generally more expensive than mirrors but are more efficient even though the light path through the prism includes two additional air/glass interfaces. Also, prisms can reduce the beam size which can be desirable for some applications of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the structure of a first embodiment of rotatable assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the form of a color cylinder, i.e., the rotatable assembly has a cylindrical periphery <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The outer surface of the cylinder consists of three primary zones (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) separated by opaque strips (<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>). These strips are oriented parallel to the cylinder&apos;s axis. Each primary zone has a different dichroic filter, which determines the color of the light which passes through the cylinder wall (red, green or blue). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As the assembly rotates, the opaque strips move along the short side of the integrator&apos;s exit window. This movement creates the effect of progressive (row-by-row) changing of the color on the active area <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The circumferential lengths of the red, green, and blue zones are picked to satisfy the system&apos;s specification for white color coordinates, e.g., x&equals;0.30 and y&equals;0.31. The circumferential length of the opaque strips are picked based on the relaxation time of the liquid crystal material used in the panel so as to achieve the system&apos;s specification for color purity of the projected image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For the rotatable assembly of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, several dichroic zones need to be produced on the same piece of glass. This can make large scale manufacturing expensive. In particular, if something goes wrong in the process of depositing the last dichroic structure on the glass cylinder, the entire unit needs to be discarded. This decreases manufacturing yield and increases the cost of the component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Another version of the rotatable assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which avoids this manufacturing problem is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In this case, the assembly comprises a plurality of plano-parallel plates or segments <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Each plate has an appropriate transmissive dichroic coating, e.g., red, green, or blue. To form the assembly, the plates can be glued together or can be mechanically affixed to a suitable housing. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the edges of individual plates can be straight or can be angle-ground so that they mate with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> If the filter plates have straight edges (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), there will be gaps between them when they are assembled to form the periphery of the assembly. These gaps will allow some white light to pass through and could reduce the contrast or color purity of the display. In such a case, the gap regions can be blocked using a black paint or other opaque material. Such blocking may be preferable if the imager requires the illumination to be blocked between sequential color fields (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). However, the blocking will reduce the total light throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Alternately, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the filter segments may have edges which are ground with an appropriate angle so that they can mate and leave a minimal gap between the filter plates. This allows the maximum amount of light through, although it can increase fabrication cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The number of segments used is determined by several competing factors. The first consideration is the cost of fabricating a rotatable assembly. Having a larger number of segments makes the device more expensive. Thus, from a cost point of view, a design with fewer segments is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The second factor is the diameter of the assembly, which is approximately proportional to the number of segments. At a minimum, the number of segments must be great enough so that the assembly will have a diameter large enough to receive reflecting surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The third factor is the rotation speed of the assembly. The number of revolutions per minute that is needed to match the frame rate of the imager is inversely proportional to the number of segments. So from this point of view, a larger number of filters (segments) is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Whether continuous or segmented, the color modulators of the invention provide an easy way to maintain the required proportion between the three primary colors. This is important because the typical high-pressure mercury arc lamp (UHP type) is deficient in red light. To obtain a required white point, one needs to increase the relative amount of red light which reaches the panel and decrease the relative amount of green and blue light. Changing the relative size of individual filters can do this. Alternatively, in the case of a segmented design, some adjacent segments can filter the same color (e.g., blue, green, red, red, blue, green, red, red . . . ) rather than changing color (e.g., blue, green, red, blue, green, red . . . ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Although specific embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated, it is to be understood that modifications can be made without departing from the invention&apos;s spirit and scope. For example, although dichroic filters are preferred, absorption filters can also be used in the practice of the invention. Also, although it is preferred that the entire periphery of the rotatable assembly performs filtering (except for any intentionally opaque areas that may be used), non-filtering regions/segments (e.g., clear regions/segments) can be included if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A variety of other modifications which do not depart from the scope and spirit of the invention will be evident to persons of ordinary skill in the art from the disclosure herein. The following claims are intended to cover the specific embodiments set forth herein as well as such modifications, variations, and equivalents. </paragraph>
