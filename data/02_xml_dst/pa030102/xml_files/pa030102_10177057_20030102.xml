<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A technique for calibrating the open-loop transmit power of a wireless communication device overcomes the inherent nonlinearities in the gain control input of a variable gain amplifier (VGA). In one embodiment, a feedback circuit generates a signal indicative of the transmit power. This signal is compared with a desired transmit power level, which comprises an open-loop gain component and a closed-loop gain component. The desired transmit power level is compared with the actual transmit power level and an error signal is generated. The error signal is used to alter the gain of the VGA in the transmitter to thereby adjust the actual transmit power level to correspond with the desired transmit power level. In alternative embodiment, the receiver portion, which also contains a VGA, is pre-calibrated in a conventional manner. During a transmitter calibration process, the transmitter is coupled to the receiver input through a mixer and filter. The pre-calibrated receiver determines the actual transmit power level. The difference is used to generate error correction data to adjust for non linearities in the gain control input of the transmitter VGA. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The disclosed subject matter is directed generally to power control in a wireless communication device and, more particularly, to a system and method for calibration of open-loop power control in a wireless communication device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Wireless communication devices are widely used throughout the world. Such wireless devices use radio frequency components, including transmitters and receivers. Proper operation of wireless devices requires the careful calibration of the transmitter and receiver sections. This is particularly important in some wireless communications schemes, such as code division multiple access (CDMA) technology where multiple users are transmitting simultaneously on the same frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As is known in the art, CDMA technology assigns different pseudo noise (PN) codes to each wireless device. The PN codes are mathematically uncorrelated to each other such that one CDMA wireless device cannot decode the radio frequency (RF) signal intended for another CDMA device. As a result, a signal transmitted from one CDMA wireless device appears as noise to other CDMA devices operating at the same frequency and in the same geographic region. Thus, it is desirable to minimize transmitted power for each CDMA device in order to reduce the noise effects on other CDMA devices. Therefore, proper calibration of each CDMA device is important for satisfactory operation of the overall CDMA system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A simplified block diagram of the receiver portion of a CDMA device is illustrated in the function block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The operation of the wireless device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in the functional block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is known to those of ordinary skill in the art and thus need not be described in great detail herein. Radio signals are detected by an antenna <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and coupled to an RF stage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The RF stage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may include a number of different components, such as amplifiers, tuning circuitry, filters, and the like. For the sake of brevity, those various components are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as the RF stage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The output of the RF stage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is coupled to an intermediate frequency (IF) stage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The RF stage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and IF stage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> amplify the signal detected by the antenna <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and shift the frequency from RF frequencies down to an intermediate frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A variable gain amplifier (VGA) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> receives the signal from the IF stage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and amplifies the signal to a desired level. As will be described in greater detail below, the variable gain amplifier has a variable gain input V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>which sets the level of amplification. Although the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a single component, a typical implementation often uses multiple stages of amplification to provide the necessary gain. However, these are engineering implementations within the skill of the design engineer. For the sake of simplicity, the multiple gain stages are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The output of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is coupled to a demodulator <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The demodulator <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> comprises quadrature mixers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The quadrature mixer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is mixed with a local oscillator ILO while the quadrature mixer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is mixed with the local oscillator QLO. The output of the quadrature mixers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are taken for further processing in a conventional manner to produce the voice signal. However, the presently disclosed subject matter is directed to control of amplifiers and is not directly related to the actual processing of the received signals to produce the audio data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The output of the quadrature mixers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are also coupled to low-pass filters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, respectively, and subsequently coupled to inputs of respective analog-to-digital converters (ADC) <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. To efficiently utilize the dynamic range of the ADCs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is designed to control the gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to produce a fixed power level at the inputs of the ADCs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The outputs of the ADCs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are provided to an automatic gain control (AGC) loop <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> that ultimately will control the gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The outputs of the ADCs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are combined in a summing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and provided to a log circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The log circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> converts the signal from a linear form to a logarithmic form to thereby permit control of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in decibels (dB). The output of the log circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is combined with a control voltage P<highlight><subscript>REF </subscript></highlight>in an adder <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The control voltage P<highlight><subscript>REF </subscript></highlight>is a control setpoint for the AGC loop <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The output of the adder <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is integrated by an integrator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and provided as an input to a linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The integrator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> averages the control signal from the adder <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and controls the response time of the AGC loop <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through the selection of an integration time. It is also possible to control the bandwitdth of the AGC loop <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by varying the gain of the integrator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. An increase of the gain of the integrator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> causes a corresponding increase in the bandwidth of the AGC loop <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. So long as the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is properly linearized, the output of the integrator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is a linear function of the power-in (P<highlight><subscript>IN</subscript></highlight>) detected by the RF stage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and IF stage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The output of the integrator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is also an indication of the strength of the received signal. The signal is generally described in the wireless communication industry as a received signal strength indicator (RSSI). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Although the RSSI is an indicator of received signal strength, the signal itself cannot be used directly to control the gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> because of the inherent nonlinearities of the variable gain input. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> compensates for non-linearities in the control voltage versus gain characteristics of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The output of the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided to a digital-to-analog circuit (DAC) <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The output of the DAC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is the control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>that controls the gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As noted above, it is desirable to produce fixed level inputs for the ADCs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is controlled by the AGC loop <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to provide the desired level at the inputs of the ADCs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the ideal gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> versus input power produced by the IF stage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the ideal linear relationship between gain and power in (P<highlight><subscript>I</subscript></highlight>N). In an ideal situation, if P<highlight><subscript>IN </subscript></highlight>decreases, the gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> increases by the same amount such that the power provided to the ADCs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is constant. Unfortunately, the variable gain input versus gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not linear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the relationship between the control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>and the gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The ideal curve shows a linear relationship between the control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>and the gain. However, process variations and design limitations of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> make it virtually impossible to achieve ideal linear relationship. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also illustrates the actual relationship between the control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>and gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The actual curve has been somewhat exaggerated to illustrated the nonlinearity between the control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>and gain. Because of this inherent nonlinearity, it is necessary to utilize the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to compensate for differences between the actual control voltage curve and the ideal voltage curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the non-linearity described herein refers to the nonlinear relationship between the voltage control V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>and the actual gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The relationship between the input and output of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is highly linear. That is, the output of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a highly accurate amplified version of the input. The non-linearity referred to herein is the nonlinear relationship between the voltage control input and the gain setting of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is used to compensate for nonlinearities in the gain control of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A number of different known techniques may be used to implement the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. One such technique utilizes piece-wise linear segments, also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, to approximate the actual control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>versus gain curve. In this manner, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> selects the linear segment that most closely approximates the desired control voltage. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a desired gain G<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. In the ideal circumstance, a control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT1 </subscript></highlight>is required to generate that gain using the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). However, due to the non-linearities in the gain control of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to produce the control voltage V&prime;<highlight><subscript>CONT1 </subscript></highlight>to achieve the desired gain G<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Using the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> selects a linear segment <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that approximates the desired control voltage V&prime;<highlight><subscript>CONT1</subscript></highlight>. With the proper selection of a linear line segment that approximates the desired control voltage, it is possible to accurately produce the desired level of gain in the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, for the sake of clarity, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a relatively few number of line segments, including the segment <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, to approximate the actual control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>versus gain. To produce the desired degree of accuracy, it is generally necessary to produce significantly greater number of line segments to approximate the actual control voltage curve. In one example, sixteen separate segments are used to approximate the control voltage curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The drawback of this process is that each individual wireless device must be carefully calibrated so that the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is customized for virtually every device. This requires careful calibration of the receiver circuitry using external test equipment and programming of the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to achieve the desired degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the transmitter section of a wireless device, which is not illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, has a similar variable gain amplifier. The control voltage curve of the transmitter variable gain amplifier must also be calibrated so that the transmit power is carefully controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Because of the importance of power control in a CDMA wireless system, the calibration of the variable gain amplifier in the transmitter of a wireless device is even more important and time-consuming than the process described above with respect to the receiver portion of a wireless communication device. Thus, accurate calibration of each wireless device requires a significant number of calibration steps using external test equipment to generate a custom selected linearizer for the transmitter and receiver of each wireless device. As those skilled in the art will recognize, this is a time-consuming process, which is difficult to perform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Using conventional techniques, each wireless device undergoes a number of calibration steps to assure proper operation of the variable gain amplifiers and linear operation for a wide range of gain settings over temperature and frequency. For a wireless device with multiple gain steps, such as a CDMA wireless device, the receiver portion may require nearly three dozen calibration steps while the transmitter portion of the wireless device may require as many as 117 different calibration steps. These processes include calibration steps for the variable gain amplifiers, including steps to assure linearity over frequency, over voltage variations of the power supply (not shown) and over the expected temperature range of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such an enormous number of calibration steps, each of which requires external test equipment, is very time-consuming in the production process and adds significantly to the cost of the product. Therefore, it can be appreciated that there is a significant need for a technique that reduces the number of calibration steps that must be performed for proper operation of a wireless device. The presently disclosed subject matter provides this and other advantages as will be apparent from the following detailed description and accompanying figures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The presently disclosed subject matter is directed to a technique to control the transmit power and overcome the inherent nonlinearities of control voltage of a variable gain amplifier. In one exemplary embodiment, a dynamic feedback loop is provided that permits precise control of transmit power without the need for a linearizer. Although the importance of power control in a CDMA system has been discussed and the examples presented herein are implementations within a CDMA device, virtually all wireless devices utilize variable gain amplifiers and suffer from the effects of nonlinearity in the gain control. The presently disclosed subject matter provides a solution to the problem of nonlinear gain control and is broadly applicable to any wireless device. The presently disclosed subject matter is not limited to CDMA technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram of one exemplary embodiment of the presently disclosed subject matter to control transmit power. In the example illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the presently disclosed subject matter is embodied in a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that dynamically adjusts the transmit power using a feedback loop. The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The antenna <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is coupled to the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the receiver portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through a diplexer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The diplexer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> permits the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to share a common antenna (i.e., the antenna <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). The diplexer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is a common device and need not be described in greater detail herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes certain elements that have previously been discussed in the functional block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, for the sake of clarity, the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> only includes certain elements from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Specifically, the RSSI is provided to the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The output of the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is coupled to the DAC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which, in turn, generates the control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT</subscript></highlight>. The control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>controls the gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In addition, the output of the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided to the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is implemented using two different gain control factors. The first gain control factor, sometimes referred to as an open-loop gain control simply sets the gain of the transmitter at a predetermined level relative to the received signal level. This factor is sometimes referred to in the industry as a &ldquo;turn-around constant.&rdquo; Thus, for open-loop power control, the transmit power is the received power plus the turn-around constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The turn-around constant is determined by industry standards and can vary based on the particular type of wireless technology. For example, the turn-around constant for cellular telephones is set by industry standard to be &plus;73 dB. That is, the transmit power is set to 73 dB above the power of the received signal. In contrast, personal communication systems (PCS) devices use an industry standard turn-around constant of &plus;78 dB. The presently disclosed subject matter is not limited by the particular level for the turn-around constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In addition to the open-loop power control, the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a closed-loop power control. While open-loop power control depends only upon the industry standard (i.e., the turn-around constant) and the received signal strength (i.e., RSSI), closed-loop power control is based solely on commands from a base station transceiver system (BTS) (not shown). The BTS sends commands to the mobile unit (i.e., the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) to increase or decrease transmit power. In a typical implementation, the BTS sends a command to increase the transmit power when the error rate of data received by the BTS is unacceptably high. Conversely, if the error rate is low, the BTS may send a command to the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to decrease the transmit power. While the turn-around constant described above is a relatively high signal level (e.g., &plus;73 dB), closed-loop power control uses very small incremental steps, such as &frac14; dB or &frac12; dB steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a transmit power reference <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, which represents both the open-loop power control signal (i.e., the turn-around constant) and the closed-loop power control signals based on commands received from the BTS (not shown). The output of the linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which is indicative of the received signal strength, is provided as an input to a summer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The transmit power reference <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> provides a signal corresponding to the selected turn-around constant, and may be an AC signal or a DC signal depending on the particular circuit implementation. The output of the summer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is a combination of the received signal strength and the turn-around constant. This signal is the open-loop gain component used to set the transmit power. In addition, the transmit power reference <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> responds to signals from the BTS (not shown) to generate closed-loop power control signals. The open-loop power control signals and closed-loop power control signals are combined by a summer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The output of the summer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is coupled to the positive input of an adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The negative input of the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> receives a feedback signal from a transmit power processor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The operation of the transmit power processor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> will be described in greater detail below. In essence, the transmit power processor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> provides negative feedback to the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which functions as an error circuit. The output of the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is an error signal that is coupled to a transmit power control circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which generates control signals for a variable gain amplifier (VGA) <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and an RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The output of the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is coupled to the diplexer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> through an isolator <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The isolator <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> maintains a constant impedance for the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment, a 50-ohm impedance is provided by the isolator <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The signal input to the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> comes from transmitter circuitry that, for the sake of clarity, is not illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The transmitter circuitry, which may typically include a microphone, vocoder, and transmitter modulator, operate in a conventional manner to provide an input signal that will actually be transmitted by the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The output of the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is also provided as an input to the transmit power processor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The transmit power processor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> generates signals indicative of the actual transmit power and provides that indicator as negative feedback to the transmitter power control circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> includes dynamic power adjustments that are extremely accurate and which eliminates the linearization process required in conventional wireless systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In operation, the positive input of the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is a signal indicating the desired transmit power. As previously noted, this is a combination of the open-loop gain control and closed-loop gain control. The negative input of the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is a signal indicating the actual transmit power. If the actual transmit power is exactly equal to the desired transmit power, the output of the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is 0 and no correction in the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> or RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is necessary. If the actual transmit power is higher than the desired transmit power, the output of the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is a negative signal, indicating that the transmit power should be reduced. In contrast, if the actual transmit power is lower than the desired transmit power, the output of the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is a positive signal, indicating that an increase in the transmit power is required. Thus, the feedback loop in the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> accurately controls the actual transmit power in a highly accurate and linear manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Details of the transmit power processor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are shown in the functional block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The transmit power processor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> includes an attenuator circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which attenuates the output signal from the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). In an exemplary embodiment, the attenuator circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> also presents a high impedance which, when combined in parallel with the isolator <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, provides the necessary constant impedance to the output of the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The attenuator circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is coupled to a squaring circuit <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, which generates a signal proportional to the output voltage squared (V<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) of the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and thus provides an indication of the actual transmit power. The output of the square circuit <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is coupled to a low-pass filter <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, which in turn is provided as an input to an ADC <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The ADC <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> provides digital representation of the transmit power. To convert the transmit power to a logarithmic scale, the output of the ADC <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is coupled to a log circuit <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The output of the log circuit <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is the negative feedback signal provided to the negative input of the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Thus, the transmit power processor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> automatically and dynamically measures the transmitted output power, converts it to digital form and provides a logarithmic representation thereof as a feedback signal in a transmitter control loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Details of the transmit power control circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are illustrated in the functional block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The output of the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) is coupled as an input to the transmit power control circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the signal from the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> includes the desired transmit power signal and the negative feedback signal. The signal from the adder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which is essentially an error signal, is provided to an integrator <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The integrator <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> averages out the error signal and also controls the response time of the feedback loop. As those skilled in the art can appreciate, a longer integration time for the integrator <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> results in slower response time for the feedback loop. The actual selection of the integrator time is a matter of design choice that is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The output of the integrator <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is provided to an input of a DAC <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, which converts the digital signal from the integrator <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to an analog signal that can be used to control the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the functional block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> simplifies the output of the transmit power control circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by illustrating a single control line to both the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. However, in the more detailed functional block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, separate control signals are provided for the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to maintain as high a signal-to-noise ratio as possible in the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. A step gain control <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is used to provide control of large step gains for the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and thereby maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio in the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. For example, the step gain control <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may permit the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to have a gain of 0 dBm or &plus;20 dBm. In this example, if the desired transmit power is relatively low, the step gain control <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may set the gain of the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to 0 dBm and permit the overall gain of the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) to be controlled by the output of the DAC <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If the desired transmit power approaches the maximum limit of the DAC <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, the step gain control <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may increase the transmit power of the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to, by way of example, &plus;20 dBm. The output of the DAC <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is adjusted correspondingly to provide any additional gain that is required beyond the gain of the power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A number of different circuit configurations may be used to provide the necessary amplification in the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For example, as previously noted with respect to the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may be implemented as a series of amplifier gain stages that are coupled in series and controlled by the signal generated by the transmit power control circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the two stages of amplification illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and controlled by the DAC <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and step gain control <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, respectively, may be combined into a single amplification stage. Furthermore, the step gain control <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may use a different step size or a different number of gain steps. The actual step size may be based on the dynamic range of the DAC <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The presently disclosed subject matter is not limited by the specific architecture of the variable gain amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and the specific control signals associated therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Thus, the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> provides a dynamic feedback loop that completely eliminates the need for linearization in the transmitter of a wireless device. This approach eliminates a large number of calibration steps that must be performed on each wireless device during the manufacturing process. The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> greatly increases productivity of the manufacturing process and may reduce the overall costs of the wireless device since costly and time-consuming calibration steps have been eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The exemplary embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> eliminates the need for linearization of the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. However, the inherent nonlinearity between the control voltage V<highlight><subscript>CONT </subscript></highlight>and the actual gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) in the receiver still requires the linearization process described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has a linearizer, but utilizes the calibrated receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to eliminate the need for external test equipment that would otherwise be required for calibration of the transmitter portion of the wireless device. In essence, the un-calibrated output of the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is coupled to the calibrated receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so that the receiver portion can be used to accurately measure the actual transmitted power levels and allow linearization of the transmitter portion. This embodiment is illustrated in the functional block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. For the sake of clarity, of the functional block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> does not provide details of circuit components that are not relevant to the particular embodiment. Specifically, the demodulator <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes components, such as mixers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, low-pass filters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the like. For the sake of clarity, those components are illustrated in the functional block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> as the demodulator <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the AGC <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which comprises a number of components illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, are merely shown in block diagram form as the AGC <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Similarly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates additional components in the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that are not illustrated in the functional block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a mixer <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and local oscillators <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that modulate data, such as voice data from a vocoder circuit (not shown) to generate the desired radio frequencies. The output of the mixer <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is coupled to the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> whose output is coupled, in turn, to the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The output of the RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is coupled to the diplexer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> via the isolator <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> includes a second mixer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> coupled to the output of the variable gain amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the local oscillators <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The mixer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> shifts the frequency of the transmitted output signal to IF frequencies compatible with the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A typical wireless communication device includes a single master oscillator from which the various local oscillator frequencies are derived. As is known in the art, the transmitter and receiver operate at different frequencies that are offset by a predetermined amount that is set by industry standards. For example, in a cellular telephone operation, the transmitter and receiver are offset by 45 MHz. The circuitry used to derive the local oscillator frequencies to produce the desired offset is known in the art and need not be described herein. The local oscillators <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> provide the necessary frequencies to the mixers <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, respectively. That is, the local oscillators <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> provide one frequency to the mixer <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> for the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and provide a second frequency to the mixer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> to convert the transmitted signal to the receiver IF frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The output of the mixer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is coupled through a band pass filter <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> to a VGA <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The band pass filter <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> operates in a conventional manner as an IF filter. It should be noted that the output of the band pass filter <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is coupled to the input of the VGA <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> via a switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, such as an electronic switch. The operation of the switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, which functions as a coupling circuit to couple the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, will be described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The output of the VGA <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are combined by a summer <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. Using this configuration, the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> utilizes the calibration of the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to calibrate the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The calibration of the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is performed in a manner known in the art and described above. During the receiver calibration procedure, the switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is deactivated so that no output from the band pass filter <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is provided to the VGA <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Following the calibration of the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is activated such that the signal from the band pass filter <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is now provided as an input to the VGA <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is calibrated during the manufacturing process in the following manner. Control signals set the gain of the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at the predetermined transmit power level. The signal from the output of the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is mixed with the local oscillator signal <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> by the mixer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> to produce an output signal compatible with the frequencies of the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The output of the mixer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is provided to the VGA <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> via the band pass filter <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and the switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> utilizes the previously calibrated receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to accurately determine the received signal level, which is proportional to the transmitted power level from the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. If the transmitted signal level is greater than or less than the desired transmitted power level, the error is detected by the calibrated receiver circuitry and the deviation is stored in the form of interim results <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The interim results the process may be repeated for numerous transmitter gain steps and different transmitter frequencies. In addition, calibration processes may be performed for different power supply levels and different temperature settings to provide an accurate characterization of the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The interim results <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> are used to generate a transmitter linearizer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The interium results <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> indicate an error difference between the desired transmit power level and the actual transmit power level. These interium data results are used to create the transmitter linearizer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and effectively determine the actual gain control curve for the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The transmitter linearizer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> operates in a manner similar to that described above with respect to that described above with respect to the receiver linearizer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. That is, the transmitter linearizer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> breaks the variable gain curve for the VGA <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> into a plurality of piece-wise linear portions that describe the actual gain characteristics and provide sufficient gain resolution. Whenever the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> calls for a particular gain setting for the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the transmitter linearizer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is used to select the actual control voltage for the variable gain amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is deactivated during normal operation of the wireless device. In the deactivated position, the switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> provides a desired degree of isolation between the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Although the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is calibrated when the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is calibrated in a conventional manner, the VGA <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is not calibrated. However, in an exemplary embodiment, the VGA <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the VGA <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are formed on a common integrated circuit substrate and are thus closely matched. The separate VGA <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> provide the desired degree of isolation between the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A variety of alternative architectures may be used by the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. For example, the mixer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> can be designed to mix to the RF frequency of the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to permit coupling of the transmitter signal at the RF stage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or at a point intermediate the RF stage and the IF stage. The presently disclosed subject matter is directed to a technique for using the calibrated receiver pathway to calibrate the transmitter and is not limited by the particular point in the receiver pathway at which the transmitter signal is injected. In an alternative embodiment, the switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> can be replaced by an SPDT switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The alternative architecture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> eliminates the need for the uncalibrated VGA <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the summer <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. The SPDT switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> must provide necessary degree of isolation between the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the SPDT switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is coupled to the IF stage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> during the calibration process for the receiver portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The SPDT switch is coupled to the band pass filter <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> during the calibration of the transmitter portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that during normal operation of the wireless device, the SPDT switch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is coupled to the IF stage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
