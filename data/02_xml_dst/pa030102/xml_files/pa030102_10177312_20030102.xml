<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A supplemental restraint system that is easy to use and provides superior protection in an vehicle is provided. The user of the system is prevented from the damaging effects of being restrained by a shoulder seat belt combination that provides inadequate support to most of the body and can produce injury at the point of contact with the body during an accident. Further, the supplemental restraint system of the present invention provides the user with a harness, having an elastic pad stretchable along the harnesses longitudinal axis, to better hold the user to the seat and restraint system of the vehicle while preventing the typical snap-back response to forward motion. In one embodiment a vest, having padding and providing other comforts, is included with the harness. The present invention provides a means of dressing an adult or a child in a restraint harness, with or without a vest, having energy absorbing padding, that may be easily attached within a vehicle and provides the user with restraints that fit the user&apos;s height and weight requirements. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns a novel collision survival system for vehicles, specifically the present invention concerns a harness that is worn by the occupants of a car and attaches to the interior of the car, the harness of the present invention is made of materials which aid in the absorption of the energy of the vehicle such that the wearer is better protected from damage caused by sudden stops or collisions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There are approximately 3.2 million fatalities and injuries in the United States every year related to automobile and other vehicle accidents. Medical expenses for the 3.2 million injuries and fatalities amount to approximately $150 billion, exclusive of property damages. Among the 3.2 million fatalities and injuries are approximately 180,000 children under the age of nine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Currently, safety equipment in vehicles includes the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Seat Belts: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Current seat belts are designed to be used in vehicles at any time that an vehicle is running. Often times, vehicle riders do not use their seat belts, generally due to neglect. Further, in case of collision, it has been found that seat belts alone do not provide sufficient protection. It has been determined that certain body parts are not protected by seat belts during collisions, for example, seat belts cannot protect the neck or head area. Also, when seat belts are worn in a collision, the belts cause severe impacts to the body in the areas where they are worn, specifically across the shoulder and belly area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Air Bags: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Most modern automobiles are provided with air bags. The standard placement of air bags is on the dashboard of the vehicle, generally facing the occupant. When an air bag deploys it typically explodes towards the passenger with great speed and force. Air bags have been known to deploy when not needed, such as when there has not been an accident or when there has been such a slight accident which as not to have required the deployment of the air bag. The deployment of air bags in such cases and in cases of accidents have been known to cause injuries and even fatalities. Further, in cases of severe collisions, air bags have been known to cause severe injury or death to small adults and to children. In addition, the chemical used to inflate the air bag, sodium azide, has been found to be unsafe for some passengers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Child Restraint Systems: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Most states require that children of a certain age or size be placed in child restraint seats in automobiles. For newborn children and small toddlers the restraints include seats that face towards the rear of the vehicle known as infant car seats. Older children are required to be places in larger forward facing child restraint seats or car seats and/or booster seats. The requirements for booster seats have recently been found to be necessary for older children who are generally smaller, as the booster seat elevated the child so as to allow a standard seat and shoulder belt to lie correctly on the shoulder and mid-section of the smaller child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The most common problem with these child restraint seats is the fact that most parents do not use the seats properly. When not used properly, these child restrain systems do not protect the child, may be ineffective in preventing injury or death in an accident and can result in injury to the child. These problems could be solved if parents use the child restraints properly. However, because there are a number of manufacturers of these seats and each manufacturer may utilize a different system of securing the seat to the automobile, it is often difficult for parents and others to know how to properly attach the seat. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns a supplemental restraint system for use in an automobile or vehicle comprising, a harness having restraints for attachment to the seat of an automobile. The harness, which may be of a variety of types, including a series of belts and buckles, or a series of braces and bars resembling a safety cage, or a typical cloth jacket worn as a garment. The jacket and harness elements are constructed of energy absorbing pads and materials which, along with the restraint provided by the jacket and harness, provided energy absorption. The materials used are light-weight and durable and are inexpensive to make and produce in desirable shapes and sizes. The harness or the jacket, or a combination of both, is wearable by a rider in the vehicle such that when the rider wears the harness, jacket or combination, the rider is secured to the seat-belt of the vehicle so that the rider remains secured against the seat of the vehicle notwithstanding the motion of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It will be understood by persons having skill in the art that their are two preferred basic embodiments of the supplemental restraint system that arise from the present invention. Each of these embodiments is tied to the type of restrain system available in the vehicle, either a three point system using a lap and shoulder belt system or a system using merely the lap belt, when that is all that is available. However, other embodiments can be derived without departing from the novel scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a vehicle having a three point adult lap and shoulder belt, typically all of the seating positions, with the exception of the rear central position, has both a lap belt and a shoulder belt. As will be explained in greater detail below, and in the detailed description, the lap portion of the vehicle lap and shoulder belt can be routed through a belt guide located along the lower edge of the jacket/harness and the shoulder belt alone is routed through the belt guide located on the shoulder of the jacket/harness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the second preferred embodiment, the vehicle has a restraint system comprising solely a lap belt. It will be understood that this system is also descriptive of the center rear position in most vehicles having a shoulder belt for all of the other seating positions. A special elastic top tether is provided for use in conjunction with the second embodiment. As will be described in greater detail below, and in the detailed description, the top tether provides upper torso restraint when using a vehicle lap belt only. The lap belt can be routed through the belt guide located along the lower edge of the jacket/harness; the tether is attached to the jacket/harness at the shoulders and to the vehicle frame at the tether anchor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the supplemental restraint system has restraints that comprise a plurality of belts forming a five point type-restraint system with a system of harnesses and harness assembly connectors allowing the connection of the harness to a modern automobile safety restraint harness system. The modem automobile safety restraint system including tether attachment points for front and rear passengers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the harness system is attached to either a jacket or a vest that allows the harness to be worn outside of the automobile in a fashionable manner and which is then attachable to the seat portions of the automobile. The jacket, or vest, is constructed using the above noted energy absorbing pads and materials in such a manner as to provide an appealing appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the supplemental restraint system has a sleeve attached to the jacket or vest, the sleeve being slideable over the back portion of the seat. In this manner, the back of the seat of the vehicle provides bracing force to the jacket or vest. In one embodiment, where the jacket resembles an ordinary cloth jacket, extra material maybe added to the back panel of the jacket to provide the slideable sleeve. The extra material being hidden in the pattern of the material or in the design of the jacket such that the jacket can be worn outside of the vehicle without appearing to be an incomplete or strange garment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the restraints comprise belts, having buckles, attached to the harness, jacket or vest and buckled together about the seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment the jacket, vest or pockets attached to the harness includes air bags, and air bag discharge sensors, strategically placed such that motions which typically cause automobile-type air bags to deploy, cause the jacket, vest or harness air bags to deploy. Further, in one embodiment, the jacket, vest or harness air bags are strategically placed on the garment or harness to provide needed restraint in an air bag deployment incident. Also, in such embodiment, the deployment of the air bags occurs or expands in a direction not diametrically opposite to the movement of the garment or harness such that the bag does not strike the user of the supplemental restraint system head-on. In this embodiment, an air bag that is placed on or near the chest portion of the garment or harness deploys in the direction that the user is travelling so that the user is not struck by the air bag. This embodiment has the added benefit of providing air bag protection for an automobile that does not have air bags built into the automobile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the harness or garment may be separated from the automobile, such that it may be worn as an ordinary garment, under a garment, or about a garment in a fashionable manner when the user is away from the automobile, and may be reattached upon returning to the automobile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a seat belt and supplemental restrain system that includes a number of harness belts, forming, in a preferred embodiment, a five-point harness system, or bars and straps that keep a passenger in his seat and which can include a number of air bags, in association with the harness belts, bars and straps, such that one or more air bags will, upon vehicle impact, inflate upon and about the passenger rather than towards the passenger. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, means to attach a restraint harness system or a jacket to the automobile seat are provided. The passenger may be seated within the harness system or jacket and, thus, be provided with a number of belts and/or bars and surrounding air bags, such that injury will be prevented by keeping the passenger in his seat and providing cushioning air bags to surround and protect the passenger. It is to be understood that the restraint system of the present invention may be provided with crash detection sensing devices and may be connected to the vehicle in such a fashion as to utilize crash sensors present in the vehicle and/or which are well known to persons having skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the present invention a supplemental restraint system that can resemble an ordinary jacket, such as a leather jacket or a wind-breaker, is envisioned. The jacket has means for sensing that an accident or impact has occurred, or has means to attach the jacket to external sensors or to the sensors conventionally found in a vehicle. The passenger puts the jacket on, in the way one would normally put a jacket on, and sits in the vehicle. The restraint system built into the jacket, including a means to attach the person to the vehicle seat, such as a wide band of jacket material (which can be as wide and tall as the entire back area of the jacket) is slid over the vertical portion of car seat-back, so as to restrain the person in the seat, and air bags, are built into the jacket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The supplemental restraints of the present invention provide a means to protect the passenger with a system that is as easy to use as putting on a jacket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The reason for the present invention is to provide a solution to the problems found in prior art seat belts, air bags and child restraint systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When air bags deploy, the speed and direction of the air bag is directly in the reverse direction of travel of the vehicle and the passengers. Accordingly, the impact on a passenger will be the sum of the speed of the vehicle at the moment of impact and the speed of the air bag as it deploys towards the passenger. For example, if the vehicle is traveling at approximately 50 kilometers per hour forward and the air bag deploys at approximately 30 kilometers per hour towards the passenger, then the passenger will feel an impact equal to an approximately 80 kilometer per hour impact. In the present invention, the moving speed and direction of passengers will be almost the same as the moving direction of the air bag deployed, thereby giving the passenger an almost zero extra impact from the air bag deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Further, due to the design of seat belts, passengers are not protected fully and may be injured at the points of contact with the seat and shoulder belt on the body. The new design solves these problems by providing restraint over a wider area. In one case, bars and straps are used to restrain the passenger to the seat, in one embodiment, and in another embodiment, the passenger may be restrained though out his entire back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A more detailed explanation of the invention is provided in the following description and claims and is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms, there is shown in the drawings a number of presently preferred embodiments that are discussed in greater detail hereafter. It should be understood that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the present invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments illustrated. It should be further understood that the title of this section of this application (&ldquo;Detailed Description of an Illustrative Embodiment&rdquo;) relates to a requirement of the United States Patent Office, and should not be found to limit the subject matter disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference> show, schematically, the results of an accident in a vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> equipped with the restraint systems <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the prior art (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), and of the present invention (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>). Vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, wheels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> a passenger seat <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a shoulder and seat belt <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> a steering wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an air bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the impact of an accident in a vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> traveling at a speed of 50 kph at the moment of impact, causes the deployment of air bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, generally at 30 kph, out of steering wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> towards the passenger <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As a result of the accident, passenger <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is thrown forward by the inertia of the accident and is held by belt <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It may be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, that passenger <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has had its head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> thrown forward by the impact because passenger&apos;s <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> torso <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has been restrained by belt <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It will be understood by persons having skill in the art, that while the terms automobile and vehicle are used, somewhat interchangeably within the specification and claims, herein, the device of the present invention can be used in any type of vehicle, including automobiles, trucks, off-road vehicles, utility vehicles, sport utility vehicles, snow-mobiles, motorcycles, ATV&apos;s, boats, other water vehicles, airplanes, jets, rocket ships and other vehicles useable on land, in the water, in the air or in space, without limitation, without departing from the novel scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a similar accident in a vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> equipped with the supplemental restraint of the present invention. As can be seen, passenger <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is restrained against seat <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by the jacket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, of the present invention. Head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is thrown forward, however, it is restrained from striking steering wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (or the dash board or other surface for such a system deployed in the front passenger or other seating location in the vehicle) by air bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the device of the present invention, however, air bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> does not travel towards passenger <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, but instead travels with passenger <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, such that upon deployment, away from passenger <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, passenger <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&apos;s head <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is gently supported by air bag <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows another embodiment, wherein the passenger travels in a special seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which allows passenger <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to face away from the general direction of travel. Such travel has been found to be safer than forward facing travel, and in combination with the supplemental restraint of the present invention, provides an extremely safe manner of travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> restraint jacket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown.

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Sandwiched between the low-density layer <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and high-density layer <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> are at least two layers of air cellular cushioning <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, air cellular cushioning layer <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> is placed such that the air cells <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>face the air cells <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of layer <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the air cellular cushioning layers (<highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>) are placed facing each other such that the air cells (<highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of one layer are centered over the gaps (<highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the other layer such that an interlocking of air cells can be achieved to provide a more thorough cushioning effect. The cushioning effect is improved in this manner as no nodes, created by gaps in both cell layers, occurs in the same place on the cushion. In one preferred embodiment, each cell layer (<highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>), comprises air cells (<highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of different sizes than the other. It will be understood by persons having skill in the art, that any number of air cellular layers may be employed in the present device without departing from the novel scope of the present invention. Persons having skill in the art will recognize that such air cellular cushioning as Air Cap&reg; and Bubble Wrap&reg; made by Sealed Air Corporation of Saddle Brook, N.J., can be used in creating the energy absorption pad <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> of the present invention. It will be understood by persons having skill in the art that layers <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> may be attached together using any know process and method, including heat sealing, adhesives or fasteners, without departing from the novel scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> portion of a tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> (similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13, 14</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is shown having an elasticized pad portion <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> attached thereto. Tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> can be of the type having adjustment means <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, such that tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> may be made larger or smaller as needed or desired. Tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is also shown as having a self locking hook <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of a type well known in the art and now associated with vehicle anchor tethers required in newer vehicles. As described above, tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> (and the others previously shown and described) are instrumental in attaching a jacket, vest or harness of the present invention to the frame of an automobile. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>, tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> has the added feature of having an elasticized pad <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> attached to the one side of long leg <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> of the generally Y-shaped tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, in such a manner as to allow energy from a sudden stop or impact, to be absorbed within the elasticized pad <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> so that the pull of tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> onto a jacket, vest or harness of the present invention, is tempered. In the manufacture of tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, material on leg <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is bunched up into a series of undulations <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>along the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> of leg <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is attached to pad <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> by a series of stitch lines <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> made in the valleys <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> of undulations <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. When tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is attached to a jacket, vest or harness of the present invention and to an automobile tether hook and forward stress (due to an accident or a sudden stop) causes the user to move towards the front of the vehicle, pad <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> will stretch, along with the undulations <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of tether <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, absorbing the energy of the forward movement. The tether will, then, more slowly cause the user to stop its forward motion, rather than causing the typical snap-back response caused by a tether of the prior art. The user is thereby less likely to receive such ill effects as whiplash and muscle strains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, elasticized strap is constructed of Polyether Foam Grade 11054000 manufactured by General Foam of Paramus, N.J., and heavy-duty woven elastic, style 6511TG from Lea &amp; Sachs, Inc. of Des Plaines, Ill. However, it will be understood by persons having skill in the art that any type of elasticized products, including other products manufactured by the above noted companies and products of other companies, that can be formed into a desired shape and having the desired properties of providing a cushioning and pulling effect to a tether, can be used without departing from the novel scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment of a supplemental restraint system, such as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20, a</cross-reference> vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> is provided having a harness <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> comprising straps and belts and buckles, as described below. It will be seen that two buckles <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> are used in the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, one at lap level and another at generally the midriff level. While two buckles <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> are shown in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, it will be understood by persons having skill in the art, that more or fewer belts and buckles can be used without departing from the novel scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, is shown in conjunction with a back support and headrest, similar to that shown as back support <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and neck restraint <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Back support <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> is removably attachable to vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> by means of any manner of cloth fastening, including but not limited to hook and eye fasteners such as Velcro&reg; fasteners. An optional headrest <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> is attachable to back support <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> by similar means, and provides additional comfort and protection to the user. It will be understood by persons having skill in the art that the present invention can be practiced without the inclusion of back support <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> and/or headrest <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. It will also be understood that while a type of back support <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> and headrest <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, any manner of providing additional back support and protection as well as neck and headrest or support may be included without departing from the novel scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Back support <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>, headrest <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> and vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> are all made of durable material, which can be made such that they are comfortable to use and wear and can easily be cleaned and maintained. Further, back support <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>, headrest <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> and vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> can include the padding materials shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>, such that they can absorb the energy of an impact while remaining light weight and comfortable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> is generally a cloth vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> having padding, as described above, and a harness <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight>, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9, 11</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that harness <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> can be merely placed onto a vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, in the same manner that a harness can be placed onto a child over the child&apos;s clothing in the practice of the present invention where a harness (such as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11, 12</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) alone is used. In a preferred embodiment, however, the vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> and harness <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> are attached together; typically by use of stitching or by other fastening means, including but not limited to the use of hook and eye fasteners (such as Velcro&reg;) and others. Persons having skill in the art will understand that the use of vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, in association with harness <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight>, gives the wearer more comfort and a more stylish appearance that use of the harness alone would provide. Further, the wearer is provided with extra padding, within vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> (as described above), and an area, that is the back side of vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, onto which a back support <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> and headrest <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> can be attached and more firmly held in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> It will be seen that the vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is constructed to include a lap covers <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> extending from each of the front segments of vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. Lap covers <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> are designed to cover the buckle of automobile seat belt (not shown) such that the seat belt is neutralized as a potential harmful element in the event of an automobile impact. Further, as noted above, vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> has been designed to include two front buckles <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> on harness <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> to provide a desirable degree of closure of vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, so that the wearer remains in the vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, and therefore buckled to the vehicle, in all eventualities. It has been found that a buckle <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> at waist level and a second buckle <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> at mid-chest level provides an excellent means to keep a wearer safe during a jarring incident (such as an accident). It will be understood by persons having skill in the art that while two buckles <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> are shown, the use of one or more than two buckles <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> in a supplemental restraint device (harness, jacket, vest, etc.) is within the scope of the teachings of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, as illustrated, further includes means <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, as described above with respect to other embodiments of the invention, to connect harness <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> to the seat belt system of an automobile. It will be seen that the design of vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> is such that it has an appealing appearance such that the user, typically a child, will enjoy wearing vest <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. In this manner the child is encouraged to wear the supplemental restraint system protecting the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It will be understood, by persons having skill in the art, that while reference has been made to children or a child as the wearer or user of the illustrated and described devices of the present invention, the manufacture and use of appropriately sized devices for adults and teenagers, persons of any age, as well as the use of the device(s) of the present invention with animals, is contemplated and does not present a departure from the novel scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that various modifications and substitutions may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the novel spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
