<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to fluid operated piston type actuators. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved end wall structure and method of fabricating an improved end wall structure for a fluid-operated piston-type actuator, as well as to a fluid operated piston type actuator including the improved end wall structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Fluid-operated piston-type actuators are well-known and in widespread use. Depending upon their particular structure, these actuators incorporate at least one and often two removable end walls for sealing the open end(s) of a bore defined in the actuator body. The end walls sealingly engage the wall of the actuator body defining the bore to prevent fluid from escaping the bore between the end wall and the actuator body. Typically, a piston rod extends through one of the end walls and is slidable relative thereto. Here, again, one or more seals are employed to prevent fluid from escaping the bore between the rod and the end wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventional end walls and arrangements for operably locating same in a fluid-operated piston-type actuator have been found to be sub-optimal for a variety of reasons. Many end walls are expensive and/or time-consuming to manufacture. Others render the actuator more difficult and expensive to assemble. Still others do not present a smooth, uninterrupted surface that can be tapped or otherwise used to anchor related components. Also, end walls that include large open cavities in their outer faces are undesirable in many application owing to the fact that dirt and other debris can collect in these cavities and the retaining band is exposed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a first aspect of the present development, a fluid-operated piston-type actuator comprises a body having first and second axial ends and an inner surface that defines a bore that opens through at least one of said first and second axial ends to define an open end of the bore. A piston is slidably positioned in the bore. An end wall is positioned in blocking relation with the open end of the bore. The end wall comprises a peripheral surface that defines a first circumferentially extending groove that is axially aligned with a second circumferentially extending groove defined in the inner surface of the body when the end wall is positioned in blocking relation with the open end of the bore. The end wall further comprises an inner face oriented toward the piston and an opposite outer face oriented away from the piston. The first groove is located axially between the inner and outer faces. The outer face covers and blocks access to a majority of the first groove and comprises a first notch defined therein that intersects and provides access to the first groove. A retaining band is located partially in both the first and second grooves. The retaining band is resiliently expanded radially into abutment with an outermost wall of the second groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present development, a method of connecting an end wall to a body of a fluid cylinder comprises placing an end wall inside an open mouth of a bore defined in a body of a fluid cylinder and adjusting an axial position of the end wall in the bore so that a first groove that is defined in a peripheral surface of the end wall is aligned with a second groove that is defined in the body. A first end of a retaining band is fed in a first direction into the first groove through a notch defined in an outer face of said end wall. The end wall is rotated in a second direction that is generally opposite the first direction so that the retaining band is received in the first and second grooves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present development, an end wall for a fluid cylinder comprises a peripheral cylindrical surface that defines a first circumferentially extending groove adapted to be aligned with a second circumferentially extending groove defined in an inner surface of an associated body when the end wall is positioned in blocking relation with an open end of the bore. The end wall further comprises an inner face and an outer face oriented away from the inner face. The first groove is located axially between the inner and outer faces and the outer face covers and blocking access to a majority of the first groove. A first notch is defined in the outer face and intersects and provides access to said first groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One advantage of the present invention resides in the provision of a novel and unobvious end wall for a fluid-operated piston-type actuator, a fluid-operated piston-type actuator including same, and a method of assembling a fluid-operated piston-type actuator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is found in the provision of a novel and unobvious method for manufacturing an end wall for a fluid-operated piston-type actuator, and an end wall made according to the method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Still another advantage of the present invention resides in the provision of an end wall for a fluid-operated piston-type actuator wherein an outer face of the end wall is primarily smooth and uninterrupted, e.g., planar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the present invention is that it provides a cost-effective method for fabricating an end wall for a fluid operated piston type actuator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A yet further advantage of the present invention resides in the provision of a fluid-operated piston-type actuator having an end wall secured to a body thereof by a metal band, wherein a majority of the band, when operably positioned, is inaccessibly located behind an outer face of the end wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Still other benefits and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains upon reading this specification.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate a fluid-operated piston-type actuator constructed in accordance with the present invention. The actuator comprises a body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having an inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that defines a cylindrical bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a through-bore that extends between and through opposite first and second axial ends <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a blind bore open at only one of the ends <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. One or more ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are defined in the body and provide fluid communication with the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is closely received in the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is adapted for reciprocal axial sliding movement between the first and second ends <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Movement and positioning of the piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is controlled by fluid pressure on its opposite faces as varied by fluid introduced into or exhausted from the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the one or more ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As is generally well-known, the piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is sealingly engaged to the inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by one or more seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that prevent or at least substantially inhibit fluid flow between the piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while still allowing for axial sliding movement of the piston as described. A rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to the piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and projects outwardly therefrom. The rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes an outermost end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> adapted to be connected to an associated member to be moved in response to axial movement of the piston/rod assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the first end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is closed by a first end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed in accordance with the present invention. The first end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, also illustrated separately in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, defines an outer face <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, an inner face <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a peripheral surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The outer and inner faces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> preferably comprise planar surfaces while the peripheral surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a cylindrical surface. The first end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is dimensioned and conformed for close, sliding receipt in the first end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The peripheral surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> defines a first circumferential groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that, when the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is operably positioned in the end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is adapted to align axially with a circumferential groove <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> defined in the inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> defining the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The grooves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> together are adapted for receipt of a retaining band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) that is preferably manufactured from a one-piece polymeric or metallic band member preformed into a circular or helical shape. An innermost wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> defines the groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to have a first depth, while an outermost wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> defines the groove <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to have a second depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, as shown in an partially installed and relaxed condition in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is resilient and defines a maximum width W that is smaller than the combined depth D (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the grooves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> defines a relaxed maximum outer diameter OD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is greater than a diameter OD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the circumferential groove <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is operatively installed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is radially compressed by the outermost wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so that its maximum outer diameter OD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reduced and made equal to the diameter OD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Consequently, when installed in its operative position, the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is in resilient compressed abutment with the outermost wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a circumferentially extending gap S is defined between the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the innermost wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the first groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is operatively installed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is partially located in each of the grooves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and axial movement of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is prevented by the presence of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The space S facilitates installation of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by providing a temporary space into which the band can move temporarily during its installation. The presence of the space S allows for the first groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to be substantially enclosed behind the outer face <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> without excessive binding of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the first groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> during installation of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. A result of this arrangement is that the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is not seated against the innermost surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the first groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when operatively installed as is readily apparent from the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment, the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is metallic and has a width W of 0.131 inches and the grooves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> have a combined depth of 0.210 inches so that the space S is 0.079 inches. It is most preferred that the space S be at least 0.05 inches. Also, it is most preferred that the groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, taken alone, also define a minimum depth of that is at least approximately 0.010 inches greater than the width W of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to allow sufficient clearance for the band during installation. Of course, these dimensions can vary without departing from the overall scope and intent of the present invention. Also, each groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a axial length sufficient to accommodate the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> when the band is operatively installed and compressed a maximum amount axially as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Generally, when the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is operatively installed, it describes at least a full circle, i.e., 360&deg; and can describe a helix having multiple turns, e.g., a helix that passes through 1080&deg;. In any case, when axially compressed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> defines an axial length equal to the stacked height of its turns, and the grooves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are dimensioned to have a slightly greater axial length to accommodate the band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> defines at least one and preferably two peripheral notches <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that preferably open in both the outer face <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the peripheral surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The notches <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are preferably located at diametrically opposed locations on the periphery of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and each intersects and communicates with the first groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Therefore, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that, when the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is operably located in the first end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the notches <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> provide a location for feeding the retaining band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> into (and for withdrawing the retaining band from) the aligned grooves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The notches <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are also conformed and located to receive two projections of an associated tool (not shown) that is used to rotate the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as needed during band installation as described below. A seal retaining peripheral groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is also defined in the peripheral surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is adapted for operative receipt of an O-ring or other seal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that sealingly engages the surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to prevent fluid passage between the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference now particularly to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a preferred method for manufacturing the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is illustrated. An axial length of raw bar stock <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided with or machined to have a circular cross-section. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the stock <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a first planar face <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and second planar face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a cylindrical peripheral face <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The surface <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the stock <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is machined using conventional machinery to define the peripheral surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> including the first peripheral groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the seal-retaining groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. Also, if desired or necessary, the face <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the stock is machined to define the outer face <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The peripheral notches <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are machined into the face <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and peripheral surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> as described above. Furthermore, if necessary or desired, the face <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the stock <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is machined to define the inner face <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Those or ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the machining involved is minimal as compared to conventional end wall structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is operably secured in the second end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Except and shown and described herein, the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is identical to the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, like features of the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> relative to the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are identified using reference numbers that are one-hundred (100) greater than those used to identify features of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and further repetition of these like features is not necessary or provided. New features are identified with new reference numerals and are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that defines the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the actuator body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> defines a circumferential groove <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that is identical to the groove <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> defined by the inner surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the first end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is operably located in the second end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the grooves <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are axially aligned with each other so that the retaining band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be used to axially fix the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as described above in relation to the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Unlike the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> defines a central opening <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in which the piston rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is slidably positioned. Thus, the piston rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> projects through the opening <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and is axially movable relative to the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in response to axial movement of the piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is defined to include a first stepped area <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> that receives an annular seal <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. The seal prevents or at least inhibits fluid flow between the rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is also defined with a region <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> adapted to receive an annular bushing and/or seal <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, installation of the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> into the second end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is explained. The procedure in identical for operative installation of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into the first end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> first end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the retaining band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is inserted into the aligned grooves <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> through one of the notches <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is preferably fed into the grooves as far as possible, typically until the first end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>travels circumferentially through the grooves for approximately 360&deg;. After that, assuming the entire band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has not been inserted to the grooves <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> (i.e., assuming that the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> describes more than a simple circle), the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is rotated in a direction Al opposite the direction in which the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has been fed into the grooves <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Continued rotation of the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the direction Al results in the entire band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> being fed into the grooves <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Preferably, rotation of the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is stopped when a second end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is located in one of the notches <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Most preferably, the second end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> defines an upturned tail <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that is inclined at an angle of, e.g., 30&deg;, and that can be pulled using pliers or the like to facilitate removal of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> according to a procedure that is a reverse of the foregoing installation procedure. During installation of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the upturned tail <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that is located in one of the notches <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is manually flattened and moved radially outwardly so that it is held substantially flat in the groove <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. When the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is to be removed, the portion of the tail <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that is visible in the notch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is pulled radially inwardly (using e.g., a screwdriver or other blade) so that the tail is pulled from the groove <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and resiliently springs and returns to its upturned state where it is easily accessible to pliers or a like tool. Because the notches <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> are relatively small compared to the entire area of the outer surface <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, the upturned tail <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is important in that it allows for use of pliers or a like tool for grasping and puling the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the confined space of the notches <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> during removal of the band. Furthermore, as noted, the tail <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is selectively movable into the groove <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to flatten the tail selectively after installation of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to minimize tampering, damage and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> main advantage of the present invention is that, when the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is fully installed, the band is visible and exposed only at the notches <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (notches <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). A great majority of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is protected and inaccessible. It is preferred that at least 75% of the first groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> be covered and rendered inaccessible behind the outer face <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, respectively. As such, a corresponding percentage of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is protected and unexposed when operatively installed. Stated another way, it is most preferred that the notches <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, taken together, expose no more than 25% of the circumference of a band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> held in the groove <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Similarly, it is preferred that the notches <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, taken together, expose no more than 25% of the circumference of a band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> installed in the groove <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. This limited size of the notches <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> limits the space for accumulation of debris. In spite of the fact that the grooves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the grooves <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are primarily enclosed behind the respective faces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, installation of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in these grooves is not difficult owing to the presence of the space S described above. As noted, the space S temporarily accommodates the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as required during its installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, when the retaining band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is operatively installed, a tail portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the retaining band can remain outside of the grooves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and extend from the notches <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. In this case, at a minimum, the portion of the retaining band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> actually located in the grooves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is formed in accordance with the present invention. Thus, the appended claims are intended to encompass this alternative arrangement insofar and the claim limitations are satisfied by the portion of the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> actually located in the grooves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments.
