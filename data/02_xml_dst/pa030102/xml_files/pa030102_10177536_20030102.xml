<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Children learn letters, numbers and the names of various objects by audible repetition accompanied with visualization. For example, often, a parent or teacher will read a book aloud while pointing to an object depicted by a word, which is read. In this way, the child is able to visually associate the object with its name. This method of teaching is generally passive, i.e., there may be little interaction between the child and the subject matter being taught. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Commercially available electronic learning toys improve upon these passive teaching methods. Commercially available electronic learning toys teach children about certain subjects while allowing children to physically interact with them. A typical electronic learning toy may have a number of buttons in the form of letters. After depressing a letter, the electronic toy might recite back the name of the letter as well as the phonetic sound of the letter. For example, after a child presses a button in the shape of the letter F, the toy may say &ldquo;F, F says fuh. The word &lsquo;fish&rsquo; starts with F&rdquo;. Using such toys, children can receive audio and visual instruction on a particular subject, and can press buttons to further reinforce the subject matter being taught by the toys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Although such toys are useful for their intended purpose, improvements could be made. For example, in many conventional electronic toys, the child&apos;s physical interaction with the toy is limited to pressing buttons. Accordingly, the child&apos;s manipulation of the toy and the toy&apos;s movement is minimal. Consequently, the child is not able to practice manipulation skills using the toy. In addition, because of the toy&apos;s limited ability to move or be moved, the toy may not be able to capture the child&apos;s initial interest and/or may not be able to keep the child&apos;s interest over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One toy that does use motion to entertain a child is the See n&apos; Say&trade; toy. This toy has a lever on its side. The lever can be pulled down by the child. After pulling the lever, a pointer in the middle of the toy spins. Eventually, the pointer stops and the pointer may end up pointing to, for example, a picture of a pig. After the pointer stops, the toy may then produce the sound of a pig, thus entertaining the child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although the See n&apos; SayT&trade; toy is entertaining, the only physical interaction that the child has with the toy is pulling the side lever down. The pointer is not directly manipulated by the child during the ordinary use of the toy. Like the previously described toys, the child&apos;s ability to manipulate the See n&apos; Say&trade; toy or cause the See n&apos; Say&trade; toy to move is minimal and is practically the same each time the child interacts with the toy. Thus, a child cannot practice or improve his manipulation skills. Moreover, because the child&apos;s ability to physically manipulate the toy is minimal, learning is not reinforced by physical manipulation. Moreover, the functionality of the See n&apos; Say&trade; toy is limited. To the extent that the toy provides instruction to the child, the instruction is only declaratory in nature. Because of its limited functionality, a child may also quickly lose interest in the See n&apos; Say&trade; toy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, new and improved toys would be desirable. Embodiments of the invention address these problems individually and collectively), as well as other problems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> For purposes of illustration, many of the embodiments described below are described with reference to a child. In some embodiments of the invention, the user is a child that is greater than about 18 months old. Preferably, the user is a child that is less than about 10 years of age. Although children are discussed in detail, it is understood that the user in embodiments of the invention could be of any suitable age (e.g., an adult). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The toys according to embodiments of the invention can teach children about one or more predetermined subjects. Exemplary subjects include number recognition, alphabetical order, number association, letter recognition, letter/word association, letter/word pronunciation, object relationships (e.g., a ball and a bat, a knife and a fork, etc.), phonics, spelling, math (including addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication), animals and animal sounds, vehicles and vehicle sounds, history, geography, counting, etc. The toys according to embodiments of the invention can also help children develop cognitive skills, perceptual skills, and motor skills. They can also teach the child the relationship between cause and effect. Accordingly, embodiments of the invention may be characterized as educational toys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, the toy need not teach the child about a predetermined subject, but can simply be used to entertain a child. For example, in some embodiments, a rotating element can have a number of images that can blend together while the rotating element is rotating so that a unique rotating image is presented to the child. In such embodiments, the toy need not be per se educational, but could instead be primarily entertaining and/or amusing to a child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An exemplary toy according to an embodiment of the invention may comprise a base and a rotating element on the base. The rotating element can be adapted to rotate about an axis. The &ldquo;axis&rdquo; can be a reference point in the toy and can pass through a point about which the rotating element rotates. The axis need not be an actual structural element in the toy. In some embodiments, the rotating element includes a first set of image elements. Each image element in the first set is positioned at a first radial distance from the axis. The rotating element can also include a second set of image elements. Each image element in the second set is positioned at a second radial distance from the axis. The first distance can be different than the second distance so that the first set of image elements and the second set of image elements respectively form two circles of different radii. In some embodiments, the image elements in the first set can correspond to image elements in the second set. For example, the first set may comprise images of letters and the second set may comprise images of objects that have names that start with the letters in the first set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To operate the exemplary toy, a child manipulates an actuator (e.g., presses the actuator) to spin the rotating element around and around. In preferred embodiments, the actuator is in the form of a large, depressible button that moves perpendicular to the orientation of the rotating element. After the rotating element stops rotating, image elements from the first set and images elements from the second set are specifically presented to the child. For example, specific image elements may be exposed through a number of windows in a cover that is over the rotating element. In some embodiments, the cover may include a single window and a set of windows. The image element in the single window may be used to prompt the child, while the image elements in the set of windows may form a limited answer set from which the child may choose. For instance, an image element can be exposed through the single window, and the user may be requested to pick one of the image elements exposed through the set of windows that corresponds to the image element in the single window. For example, the single window may have the letter B in it, while the set of windows may show a ball, glove, and shoe. The toy may request that the user pick the object that starts with the letter B. If the child selects the wrong image element in the set of windows, the name of the image element can be stated to the user and the toy may request that the user try again. If the child selects the correct image element, the toy may provide a congratulatory message or sound effect for the user. In embodiments of the invention, audio outputs from the toy can prompt the child for a response, reinforce concepts taught by the image elements, and/or congratulate the child for successful responses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention have a number of advantages. First, in embodiments of the invention, a child can physically manipulate the toy in different ways. In embodiments of the invention, a child can cause the rotating element to spin by either using an actuator or grasping the rotating element directly. By directly grasping the rotating element, the child also can manually place particular images within particular windows to cause the toy to produce a particular output and/or to respond to an inquiry produced by the toy (e.g., &ldquo;can you put the letter A in the top window&quest;&rdquo;). In this process, the child aligns an image element with a window to obtain the correct answer and the child is able to improve his manipulation skills using embodiments of the invention. The manipulation of the rotating element reinforces learning (i.e., audial and visual instruction reinforced by kinesthetic activity). Second, the spinning motion of the rotating element is entertaining to the child. The rotating motion is capable of capturing the initial interest of a child and is also capable of retaining the child&apos;s interest. Lastly, as noted below, embodiments of the invention have a plurality of different learning modalities. The toy can provide, for example, declaratory instruction, questions for the child to answer, and the ability to practice manipulation skills. The toy uses a number of different learning modalities so that learning is reinforced in many different ways. These learning modalities can be preprogrammed into the memory of the toy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. A handle <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is provided at the top of the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to allow a child to carry it. An actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the form of a depressible element is at the center of the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and passes through a cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is coupled to the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When it is depressed, the actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> causes the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to spin. A speaker <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is near the bottom of the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide audio outputs for the child. Audio sequences may be played by the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> before, during and after, the spinning of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may have any suitable dimensions. For example, in some embodiments, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be less than about 12.5 inches high and less than about 3 inches thick, while the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be less than about 9 inches in diameter. The toy may be portable and can be easily carried by a child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated example, the cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> partially covers a rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is in the form of a circular wheel. The circular wheel has an undulating edge and is on a base (not shown). When it spins, the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> spins between the base and the cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the base, and the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be made of molded plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Various mechanical switches may be provided in the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A child may use these switches to alter the operation of the toy. For example, in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> volume switch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (e.g., high and low volume) and a mode selection switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are near the bottom of the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A child can use the volume switch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to adjust the volume of the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The mode selection switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can allow the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be in different modes. For example, the mode selection switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can allow the child to turn the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> off, place the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a learn mode or place the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a game mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> One or more images of animated characters may be on the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, in the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> 3-dimensional relief image of a frog is on the actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This image can be used to help prompt the child to press the actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. For example, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (e.g., using a speech synthesizer chip) can prompt the child to press the 3-dimensional image of the frog to spin the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Other animated character images may also be on the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The other animated character images on the toy (e.g., the firefly near to top of the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) can be functional or non-functional. For example, in some embodiments, the animated character images may be pressure sensitive switches that can be depressed by a child. The toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can produce some output in response to the activation of these pressure sensitive switches. For example, after depressing the frog near the bottom of the tree in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may play a song. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The child can spin the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that it rotates around an axis (not shown). The axis passes through the center of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and is generally perpendicular to the plane of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Illustratively, a child may press down on the 3-dimensional image of the frog on the actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> then moves downward relative to the cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or vertically with respect to the orientation of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The downward motion of the actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> causes the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to spin. A spiral screw (not shown) and gear-like elements with teeth (not shown) inside of the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> translate the downward motion of the actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into a rotating motion. Eventually, the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> stops so that one letter in the first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is shown in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is exposed through the set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, three image elements (e.g., images of a ball, cat, and a balloon) are shown in the set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As will be explained in further detail below, a magnetic element (not shown) in the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, can stop the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at an appropriate position so that certain image elements from the first and second image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are automatically aligned with the windows <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The child can also manipulate the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by grasping the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the open region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. After grasping the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the child can move the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> clockwise or counterclockwise. In some embodiments, the child can spin the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> fast by grasping the side of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the child can carefully move the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that selected image elements in the first and second sets <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, are exposed through the windows <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In this way, the child can actually input information (e.g., responses) into the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using the rotary element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may ask the user to put the letter A in the top window (first window) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The child then deliberately rotates the rotating element until the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; shows in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. After the letter A shows in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the toy may automatically say &ldquo;A, A says ahh&rdquo;. This is unlike many conventional toys that only have buttons that allow the child to input a response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Although the actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is in the form of a large depressible button in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the actuator could take other forms in other embodiments of the invention. For example, the actuator could be in the form of a lever that is disposed to the side of the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To spin the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the child pulls the lever down. In yet other embodiments, the actuator could be a string that is pulled by the user. However, a depressible actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is desirable, since it is easier for a child to operate (e.g., a pushing instead of a pulling motion). The depressible actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> also reduces the lateral width of the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as compared to a toy with a lever on its side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> relate to each other in some way. For example, in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises the letters of the alphabet, while the second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises images of objects that begin with the letters in the first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. For instance, the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; is in the first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a corresponding image of an apple is in the second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In another example, the first set of image elements may comprise uppercase letters while the second set of image elements may comprise lowercase letters. In yet another example, the first set of image elements could comprise images of the numbers 1 through 12, while the second set of image elements could comprises image of representations of the numbers 1 through 12 such as sets of dots, each set of dots having from 1 to 12 dots. In yet another example, the first set of image elements and the second set of image elements could comprise respectively different, but related objects. For example, an object in the first set may be a ball, while a related image in the second set may be a bat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can include images of any suitable type. Exemplary images include images of symbols, letters, numbers, shapes, and objects. Examples of desirable objects are those easily identified or recognized by young children. Such objects may include images of cats, dogs, balloons, apples, vehicles,(e.g., cars, trains), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The letters in the fist set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are arranged in a first circle. Each letter is located at about the same distance, or a first distance, from the center of the first circle. Each image in the second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be located at the same distance, or a second distance, from the center of a second circle formed by the second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. An axis (not shown) may pass through the centers of the first and second circles and may be perpendicular to the first and second circles. The first distance and the second distance may be different. In this example, the first distance is greater than the second distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The cover <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can also include a number of windows <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. It is understood that the size, location, and number of windows <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may vary in embodiments of the invention. In the illustrated example, a first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> selectively exposes image elements from the first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> selectively exposes image elements from the second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is at a first distance from the axis passing through the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, while each window in the set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is at a second distance from the axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In this example, the image element in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be used to prompt the child for a response, while the image elements in the set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be a group of image elements from which the child may select an answer. For example, the letter A is shown in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and an apple, cat, and a balloon are shown in the set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In this example, the apple may be the correct second image element that corresponds to the letter A, and the user can select the apple by opening or closing the door <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> associated with the window showing the apple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Other mechanisms for selectively identifying image elements can be used instead of windows. For instance, instead of windows, identifiers such arrows that are printed on the cover can be used to selectively identify one or more image elements for the user. Whatever type of image element identifier is used, one or more identifiers (e.g., one or more windows) may identify one or more image elements from the first set of image elements. In addition, one or more identifiers (e.g., windows) can identify one or more image elements in the second set of image elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may include sliding doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that can be manipulated by a child. The doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be solid or partially translucent or transparent. For example, in some embodiments, the doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can have apertures in the form of a heart, crescent, and star so that the child can partially see through the doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Switches may be associated with the sliding doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that the child can provide responses to the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the sliding doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the sliding doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are in a closed position when the child is not manipulating them. The child can open the sliding doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to input specific responses into the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the sliding doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be in an open position when the child is not manipulating them, and the child can close them to input specific responses into the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Other input devices could be used in other embodiments. For example, depressible buttons (not shown) could be below each window and the user could depress the appropriate button to select a particular image element within a window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the corresponding sliding doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be colored with different colors to allow the child to select a particular window. For example, the windows in the set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be colored red, blue, and green. Thus, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can prompt the child by asking the child to open a colored door. For example, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may ask the child, &ldquo;can you open the green door&quest;&rdquo;, or &ldquo;what did the letter B hide behind the yellow door&quest;&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (and the toy generally) may also be shaped in a way that is inviting to children. The cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be colored with bright colors and/or may have images of animated characters on it. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be in the form of a tree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may also include an open region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that does not cover a portion of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A child may manipulate the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by grasping the exposed portion of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The child may thus rotate the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> manually without depressing the actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The child&apos;s manipulation skills can be tested and improved by manually grasping the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, a speech synthesizer in the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may ask the child to place the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; in the first window. The child may the grasp the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and rotate it until the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; is in the window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A reward such as a congratulatory message can be played for the child if the child is successful. If the child is not successful, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could provide hints such as &ldquo;the letter A comes before the letter B&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The mode selection switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can allow a child select from two or more operational modes. Exemplary operational modes include a learn mode and a game mode. Further specific details about game modes and the learn modes suitable for use in embodiments of the invention are provided in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/302,731, filed Jul. 2, 2001. This U.S. Provisional Patent Application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can have a learn mode. In the learn mode, the child can press the actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to spin the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or could spin the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by directly grasping the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the open region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> spins, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may play a song or sound effects. After a period of time, the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> stops rotating. If, for example, the letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; is shown in the window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (e.g., after rotating the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), after a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 2 seconds) at that position, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can say, &ldquo;B says buh&rdquo;. After this, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may prompt the child to open one of the three doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Although there are three doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, only one door may contain the object, which corresponds to the letter in the window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The suggested door <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could have an image of an object, where the name of the object begins with the letter B. For example, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may have a blue, red, and yellow doors, and the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may prompt the child to &ldquo;open the blue door to find a surprise&rdquo;. After opening the blue door, the child may find that an image of a ball is shown through the open window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may comprise a translucent or transparent covering. The covering can be coupled to a switch that, when depressed, causes the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to sound an output that relates to the image shown in the window. After the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> stops rotating, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can prompt the child to press the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. For example, the letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; may be shown in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the toy may prompt the child to press the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to hear the name and sound of the letter. After the child presses the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may say &ldquo;B says Buh&excl;&rdquo;. A display device (not shown) such as an LED could flash as the toy is providing this audio output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Another mode that can be selected using the mode selection switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be a game mode. In the game mode, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can ask the child to find a letter by rotating the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to place a letter in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. For example, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may ask the child to place the letter &ldquo;K&rdquo; in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. After the child places the letter K in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may provide a reward message and then say, &ldquo;K, says kuh&rdquo;. If the child selects the wrong letter such as the letter Z, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may say &ldquo;you found the letter Z, Z says zuh.&rdquo; After the child selects the right letter, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may prompt the child to open one of the doors to find an object that starts with the letter K. For example, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may say, &ldquo;open a door to find an object that starts with the letter K&rdquo;. The doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be in a closed position and the child can partially see through small apertures in the doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The child may then peek through the apertures to see what objects are partially hidden by the doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, images of a key, an octopus, and a gumball machine might be partially visible to the child through the closed doors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the child opens the door covering the image of the key, then the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may provide a congratulatory message for the child, and the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may say, &ldquo;you found the key, flute starts with K&rdquo;. If the child opens the incorrect door such as the door covering the octopus, the toy may say, &ldquo;you found the octopus, octopus starts with O&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows another toy according to another embodiment of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, like numerals illustrate like elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The illustrated toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can teach a child animal names and sounds, colors, rhyming, and phonics. A child can spin the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and learn animal names and sounds, play a mommy/baby matching game, or add animals to an interactive song. In some embodiments, toy may play suitable music appropriate for the theme for the toy while the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotating. For example, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may play &ldquo;Old MacDonald Had a Farm&rdquo; when the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotating. Such songs and other audio may be encoded in the memory unit of the toy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that includes a first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprising images of animals (e.g., adult cows, pigs), and a second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises images of other objects and/or animals (e.g., baby animals). The image elements shown in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a horse, which appears to be in a corral that is depicted on the cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The image elements shown in the set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> include a moon, star, and a horse. Like the prior embodiment, each of the windows in the set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be colored a different color. In this toy embodiment, the child might be asked to open the door <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> covering the image element in the set of windows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the image element shown in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a mode switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with 4 selectable positions for four modes. The modes include, for example, off, a learn mode, game mode, and a music mode. In this example, the mode switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is in the form a wheelbarrow that slides from left to right and back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the learn mode, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> prompts the child to spin the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> stops, the child toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can hear about the mommy animal in the corral (e.g., &ldquo;Moo, I&apos;m Cora Cow&excl; I&apos;m black and white. My baby&apos;s behind the blue window. Open the blue window.&rdquo;). If the child presses the corral, the child will hear more information about the mommy animal (e.g., &ldquo;Moo. I&apos;m Cora Cow&excl; I make milk. My baby is called a calf.&rdquo;). When the correct door is opened, the toy may respond appropriately (e.g., &ldquo;It&apos;s a little calf&excl; That&apos;s my mommy&excl;&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the game mode, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may select one animal as a &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; animal. The toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> prompts the child to put one of the animals in the corral (i.e., in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). For example, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may say to the child, &ldquo;Farmer Leap is looking for the cow. Can you put the cow in the corral&quest;&rdquo; The child may grasp the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at an open region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and may carefully rotate the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> until the appropriate animal is exposed through the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. If the child puts the correct animal into the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may further prompt the child. For example, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may say &ldquo;Moo, I&apos;m Cora Cow. Farmer Leap is looking for me&excl; Can you find my baby&quest; Open a window. If the correct door <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the correct window <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is opened, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may say, &ldquo;It&apos;s a little calf. Moo&excl; You found my baby&excl; Let&apos;s play again&excl;&rdquo; If the door <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the incorrect window is opened, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may respond appropriately (e.g., &ldquo;It&apos;s a duckling. That&apos;s not MY baby&excl;&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the music mode, a song may play and the particular objects in one or more of the windows <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be added to the song. For example, if a child puts the horse into the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, then a song such as &ldquo;Old McDonald had a farm&rdquo; could play with the word &ldquo;horse&rdquo; and a whinnying sound being inserted into the appropriate lines in the song. Accordingly, in the music mode, the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may automatically incorporate a child&apos;s input information into the song. Appropriate computer code for accomplishing this and other functions of the toy may be in the memory unit of the toy. Programming the toy to accomplish the toy functions described herein can be done by those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, clues may be given if the child puts the wrong animal in the first window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The child may also receive a clue by pressing an appropriate button on the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> For example, clues such as the starting sound of the animal&apos;s name (e.g., for a pig, an exemplary hint might be &ldquo;my name starts with the sound puh&rdquo;), a word that rhymes with the animal&apos;s name (e.g., for a pig, an exemplary hint might be &ldquo;my name rhymes with dig&rdquo;), a fun fact about the animal (e.g., for a pig, &ldquo;I like to play in the mud&excl;&rdquo;), or the animal&apos;s color may be provided to the child for each wrong answer input into the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Unlike the toy embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, both the first and the second sets of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprise images of objects. Also, unlike the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be near the bottom of the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> instead of the top of the toy. Accordingly, in embodiments of the invention, the windows <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, may at any suitable location in the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(a) shows a plan view of a rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. In this example, a first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises letters of the alphabet, while a second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises images of objects with names that begin with the letters of the alphabet. A center depression <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is at the center of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Within this center depression <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is a central portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that includes a region with teeth <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The region with teeth <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is in the form of a circle that surrounds a hole <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the center of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As will be explained in further detail below, a spiral screw element can pass through the hole <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and a corresponding region with teeth on the front cover of the toy can mate with the region with teeth <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(b) shows a perspective view of another rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. The rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(b) has a first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> including the numbers 1 through 20. The rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also includes a second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that includes the numbers 1 through 20, but in a different form than in the first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As in other embodiments, each of the images in the first set of image elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> corresponds to an image in the second set of image elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A toy including the rotating element shown in this Figure can teach a child about number recognition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(c) shows a schematic diagram of another rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to another embodiment of the invention. In this example, the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> does not include a first set of image elements or a second set of image elements. Instead, a pointer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is printed on the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and can point to image elements <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> arranged around the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this example, the image elements <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are printed around a border region <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of a base. The border region <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is cooperatively structured to receive the rotating element and the rotating element rotates within the border region <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. In this example, the image elements are schematically shown as the letters A through H. The letters A through H could be, for example, images of eight different animals (e.g., a cow, goat, pig, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> After the child depresses the actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> spins around and eventually stops. After the pointer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> stops, the pointer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> points to one of the image elements <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can produce an output that is associated with the particular image element. For example, the image element that the pointer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> points to may be a picture of a cow, and after the pointer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> points to the cow, the toy can produce the sound &ldquo;Mooo&excl;&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the underside of the top cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of an embodiment of the invention. The top cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a raised, circular portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A circular region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with teeth is inside of the raised, circular portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A spiral screw <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is inside of the circular region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with teeth. The circular region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with teeth engage the teeth (not shown) of the circular portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> on the rotating element (see, e.g., the region with teeth <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(a)). The top cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also includes a plurality of rollers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that can contact the rotating element (not shown) so that the rotating element moves with respect to the top cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The rollers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be lubricated (e.g., greased) as appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In operation, the child depresses the actuator passing through the cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Pressing the actuator causes the spiral screw <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to move down, and the spiral screw <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> causes the circular region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with teeth to rotate. The teeth on the circular region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> engage corresponding teeth on the rotating element (not shown). The rotating circular region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> causes the rotating element to rotate. The rollers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> reduce the friction between the cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the rotating element, thus allowing the rotating element to spin relative to the top cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the base (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the back of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as it lies against the cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. As shown, the cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes holes <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> so that sound from an internal speaker can pass through the cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a raised portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the center depression (see, e.g., &ldquo;<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(a)) on the opposite side of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). A conductive element <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> with a plurality of conductive fingers is on the raised portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The conductive fingers of the conductive element <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> contact predetermined conductive traces on a circuit card on the base of the toy when they are at a particular angular position. Thus, when the angular position of the conductive element <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> changes, the number and/or combination of conductive traces contacted may change. Thus, each angular position is associated with a different number and/or combination of conductive traces. In this way, a processor in the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can determine which image elements are currently being presented to the child. This aspect will be described in further detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is disposed around the inner edge of the outer rim of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this example, the magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> forms a generally continuous circular shape, and has many peaks and valleys. In other embodiments, the magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> could be a discontinuous structure. An inner cover <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> covers the magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can be used to automatically align the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and is described in further detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the front of the base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. In this example, the base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> also forms the back cover of the toy. The base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that extend vertically from the major surface of the base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> reduce the friction between the base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the rotating element (not shown) that would be on the base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. A battery housing <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is present in the base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to house batteries that can supply power to the toy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A circuit card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with a pattern of conductive lines in the form of arcs is also on the base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and can be electrically coupled to a processor disposed within the toy. The conductive element with conductive fingers (see, e.g., element <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) on the back of the rotating element contact a predetermined number and/or combination of the conductive lines when the conductive fingers are at a particular radial position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A magnetic stop element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is at a peripheral region of the base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The magnetic stop element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the magnetic structure in the rotating element can automatically align the rotating element so that the image elements on it are within the windows on the cover of the toy. The magnetic stop element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be a flexible plastic arm that extends from the major surface of the base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. A magnet is at the end of the arm. When the motion of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is slow enough, the magnet attracts a peak in the magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and stops the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a schematic drawing of how the stop element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> stops the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from rotating. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> portion of a rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> including an undulating edge region <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and an undulating magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is shown. The undulating edge region <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the rotating structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may comprise molded plastic. The undulating magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> has peaks <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>(a) and valleys <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>(b) that correspond to the peaks and valleys in the undulating edge region <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the undulating magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is formed from a plurality of rigid, U-shaped magnetic strips that secured (e.g., glued) to the inner edge region surface of the rotating element from end to end. In another embodiment, the undulating magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> could be a single strip of magnetic material that is shaped so that the peaks in the shaped magnetic material correspond to the peaks in the edge region <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In yet another embodiment, the magnetic structure could be a discontinuous pattern of magnetic material that is secured or deposited on the inner surfaces of the edge region <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> where peaks are present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A magnetic stop element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> including a magnet <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>(a) is disposed outwardly from the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. After the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rotates, the speed of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> eventually decreases and the magnet <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>(a) is attracted to the peak <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in the magnetic structure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and completely stops the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from rotating. The rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> stops at a predetermined position and is automatically aligned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a view of the front of the base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the back of the top cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the back of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Conductive connectors <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> couple a circuit board <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with a processor to buttons on the top cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a speaker. The base <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the top cover <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be secured together using any suitable securing mechanism (e.g., screws). When they are secured together, the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can rotate freely between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A circuit card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the circuit board <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through a conductive connector <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. As shown, the circuit card <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has curved conductive traces at six different radial positions. At different angular positions, the conductive fingers of the conductive elements <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> may bridge different combinations of the conductive lines. A processor (not shown) in the toy <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can determine which number and/or combination of conductive traces have been short circuited by the conductive element <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> so that the processor can determine the specific position of the rotating element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the particular output that will be provided to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, a binary encoding scheme may be used. The particular number of conductive traces in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is more than sufficient to provide encode, for example, at least 26 different angular positions corresponding to the 26 letters of the alphabet. At least 26 different outputs can be provided for the 26 letters of the alphabet. </paragraph>

The host site <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and the user site <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are coupled through a communication medium <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. Many user sites may be present. However, only one user site is shown for simplicity of illustration. The host site <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> may include a server computer <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> operated by a host company. In this example, the host site <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> has a server computer <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that can access a content database <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The server computer <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is typically a powerful computer or cluster of computers. For example, the server computer can be a large mainframe, a minicomputer cluster, or a group of servers functioning as a unit. In one example, the server computer may be a database server coupled to a Web server. The server computer can behave as a single computer that services the requests of one or more client computers. For example, one or more client computers <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> at different user sites can communicate with the server computer through the communication medium <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and optionally through one or more Internet Service Providers (ISPs) (not shown). The client computers typically have less memory and less computing power than the server computer <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The server computer <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> can be remotely located with respect to the client computer <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The server computer <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> can have computer code for performing any suitable function.

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The content in the content database <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and the electronic content that may be in the toy <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> itself may be in any suitable form. For example, the content may be in the form of compressed or uncompressed data. The content may be in the form of sound files such as MP3 files, WAV files, and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) files. The content may also be in the form of graphic files such as video files, image files (e.g., bitmaps), and text files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> At the user&apos;s site <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a client computer <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> can be operatively coupled to a linker device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The linker device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the client computer <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> through a wireless or a wired link (e.g., a cable). The toy <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> can receive computer code from the server computer <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> through the client computer <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> via the linker device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The client computer <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> may have any suitable characteristics. For example, the client computer <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> can be an ordinary personal computer running a Windows&trade; based operating system. It may have a suitable Internet browser such as Microsoft Explorer&trade;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The linker device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> may be any suitable device capable of transferring data between the client computer <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and the toy <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The linker device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> could be, for example, a wireless transceiver such as a wireless RF (radio frequency) transceiver or an infrared transceiver. In preferred embodiments, however, the linker device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is capable of reading information from, and writing information to, the transferable information storage medium. In a typical embodiment, the transferable information storage medium may be a cartridge that can be inserted into both the linker device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and the base unit of the toy <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. Using the linker device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, data can be transferred to the toy directly or indirectly. </paragraph>
