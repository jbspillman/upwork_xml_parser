<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A device for manufacturing a preform for optical fibers is described, comprising a chemical deposition chamber including at least one gripping member rotatably mounted about an axis Z-Z and adapted to hold at least one end of at least one elongated element constituting a substrate for chemical deposition for forming a preform for optical fibers. The chamber further includes at least one burner which is mobile along a direction substantially parallel to said axis Z-Z and suitable for depositing, on said at least one elongated element, a chemical substance for forming a preform, and at least one suction element arranged on the opposite side to said at least one burner with respect to said axis Z-Z and adapted to collect and discharge, from said chemical deposition chamber, exhaust chemical substances. Said at least one gripping member is advantageously associated with a carriage which can be removed from said chemical deposition chamber in order to be able to carry out the positioning of the cylindrical support (before the deposition) in the gripping member and the removal of the preform (after the deposition) from the gripping member outside of the chemical deposition chamber and, possibly, in a position away from it. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device for manufacturing a preform for optical fibres. More specifically, the invention relates to a device for manufacturing one or more preforms for optical fibres through a chemical deposition process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As known, the methods for manufacturing optical fibre basically comprise a first process of manufacturing a preform from glass and a successive process of drawing the optical fibre from the preform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The most common processes of manufacturing preforms comprise one or more chemical deposition steps, through one or more burners, of suitable chemical substances on a cylindrical support; the chemical deposition substances typically comprise silicon and germanium, which are deposited in the form of oxides (SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>e GeO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The processes of manufacturing preforms through chemical deposition known in the art comprise processes of the VAD (Vapor Axial Deposition) type and processes of the OVD (Outside Vapor Deposition) type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Typically, in VAD type processes the cylindrical support is held in a vertical position by a gripping member which operates on an upper end of the cylindrical support; the cylindrical support is made to turn upon itself so as to expose its entire surface to one or more burners which are housed near to the lower end of the support and in such a position as to emit a flow of reactants along a direction which is inclined at a predetermined angle, typically lying between 30&deg; and 50&deg;, with respect to the longitudinal axis of the support. The support is then moved upwards so as to allow substantially axial growth of the preform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In processes of the OVD type, on the other hand, the cylindrical support is held in a horizontal or vertical position by a pair of gripping members which operate on the opposite ends of the support; the support is made to turn upon itself so as to expose its entire surface to one or more burners mounted on a side of the support and in such a position as to emit the flow of reactants along a direction which is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the support. The burner, in particular, is mounted on a support structure equipped with a motorised driving member which allows the repeated movement of the burner parallel to the cylindrical support, so as to allow a substantially radial growth of the preform along all the sections of the support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A typical process of the OVD type comprises the following steps. In a first step a substantially cylindrical glass preform, called &ldquo;core preform&rdquo;, is manufactured through deposition of the chemical substances on the cylindrical support: such a preform is named in such a way since it will create the core and a more internal portion of the optical fibre&apos;s cladding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a second step, the cylindrical support is taken out of the core preform, freeing up a central hole in the preform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a third step, the core preform undergoes a process of desiccation and compacting in a furnace, during which suitable gases (comprising, for example, Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) are made to flow inside the central hole in order to eliminate the hydroxide ions (&mdash;OH) and the atoms of water present in the preform, thus obtaining a vitrified core preform which exhibits a central hole having a smaller diameter than that of the initial preform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a fourth step, after having created the vacuum inside the hole, the vitrified core preform is placed in a vertical furnace in which the melting of a lower end of the preform itself is carried out. Such a melting causes the walls of the hole to collapse due to the vacuum created inside of it; the glass material cools down to form an elongated cylindrical element of a predetermined diameter, which is pulled downwards by a suitable traction device. Such an elongated cylindrical element is then cooled down further and cut transversally at many equidistant points so as to form a plurality of elongated elements, also known as &ldquo;core rods&rdquo;, typically having a length greater than 1 m and a diameter of between 10 and 20 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a fifth step, each core rod is used as a substrate for a further chemical deposition process (known as &ldquo;overcladding&rdquo;) similar to that of the first step discussed earlier. In particular, on each core rod and through at least one burner, a plurality of chemical substances are deposited (amongst which, typically, there is silicon oxide) which will then constitute the outer portion of the optical fibre&apos;s cladding. At the end of the process a low-density final preform is obtained, from which the optical fibre will then be drawn. Before the drawing, the low-density final preform is desiccated and consolidated with the same procedures seen in the third step. In this way a vitrified final preform which is ready for the drawing process is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Various devices for manufacturing a glass (core or final) preform for optical fibres through processes of the OVD type are known. Such devices typically comprise a chemical deposition chamber inside which are housed the gripping members of the cylindrical support constituting the chemical deposition substrate for the formation of the preform, a burner which is mobile parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical support, and a suction hood positioned on the opposite side to the burner with respect to the cylindrical support and adapted to collect and remove the particulate and the exhaust chemical substances produced inside the chamber during the chemical deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> JP 2000-313625 discloses a device for manufacturing a preform for optical fibres, wherein the gripping members hold the cylindrical support for preform formation in a horizontal position and the chemical deposition takes place through a plurality of burners lined up next to each other and mobile parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical support. Moreover, a suction hood is provided on the opposite side to said plurality of burners with respect to the cylindrical support; the hood also moves parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical support and in synchrony with said plurality of burners. The Applicant observes that, in such a device, the loading of the cylindrical support (before the chemical deposition) and the removal of the preform (at the end of the chemical deposition) must be carried out by the operator manually and directly inside the chemical deposition chamber; there is therefore the risk that, during such operations, the support or the preform can knock against the walls of the device or other elements of the device itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,732 discloses a device for manufacturing a preform for optical fibres, wherein the gripping members hold the cylindrical support for preform formation in a vertical position and the chemical deposition takes place through an array of burners substantially extending along the whole length of the cylindrical support and which is made to oscillate parallel to the longitudinal axis of the support in such a way that each burner acts on only one predetermined portion of the support. In order to facilitate the operations of loading the supports (before the chemical deposition) and of removing the preforms (at the end of the chemical deposition), the array of burners is angularly mobile inside the chemical deposition chamber from the working position (position taken up during chemical deposition) and a service position (position taken up during loading/removal of supports/preforms). The Applicant observes that, also in such a device, the loading of the cylindrical support (before the chemical deposition) and the removal of the preform (at the end of the chemical deposition) are carried out by the operator manually and directly inside the chemical deposition chamber; also in this case, therefore, there is the risk that, during such operations, the support or the preform can knock against the walls of the device or other elements of the device itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,684,384 discloses a device for simultaneously manufacturing a plurality of preforms for optical fibres, comprising a plurality of chemical deposition chambers each adapted to house a cylindrical support for chemical deposition for the formation of a preform. Each chamber is equipped with a mechanism for moving the gripping members for the cylindrical support; such a mechanism is structurally constrained to the chemical deposition chamber and allows the angular displacement of such gripping members from a first operative position, wherein the loading of the cylindrical support (before the chemical deposition) in the gripping members and the removal of the preform (at the end of the chemical deposition) from the gripping members take place, to a second operative position, wherein the cylindrical support which was loaded into the gripping members is carried close to the burners so as to start off the chemical deposition operations. Such a deposition then takes place through a plurality of burners associated with a system for moving the burners which carries all of the burners to complete a substantially rectangular route, during which they cyclically move parallel to the supports and deposit thereon chemical substances for preform formation. A plurality of hoods are provided on the opposite side to the burners with respect to the cylindrical supports to discharge the exhaust substances. The Applicant observes that, in such a device, the loading of the cylindrical support (before the chemical deposition) and the removal of the preform (at the end of the chemical deposition) take place manually inside a confined space of limited size provided around each chemical deposition chamber. There is also in this case, therefore, the risk of incurring possible collisions of the support and/or preform with the walls of the device or other elements of the device itself during the operations of loading the supports and removing the preforms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has therefore found a problem which is common to the devices of the known type. Such a problem consists in the difficulty of loading the support in the chamber before the process of deposition and of removing the preform from the chamber at the end of the process of deposition avoiding collision with the walls of the chamber or with other elements present within the chamber. In all the devices described above, indeed, particular attention and care must be paid during such operations of loading the support and/or removing the preform in order to avoid the risk of collisions. Such operations are, moreover, relatively complex and laborious due to the encumbrance of the support and, at the end of the deposition process, the weight of the preform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Moreover, such operations must be carried out in a relatively slow manner, thus limiting productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has found a solution which is constructively simple and at the same time functional which allows the positioning of the cylindrical support and the removal of the preform in and from the gripping members to be carried out in an easy an quick way and without incurring the risk of collision highlighted above; such a solution consists in associating the gripping members with a carriage which is removable from said chemical deposition chamber. In such a way it is indeed possible to carry out the operations of loading the support and removing the preform in and from the gripping members in an extremely simple way and in conditions of increased safety outside the chemical deposition chamber and, possibly, in a position away from it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates, therefore, in a first aspect thereof, to a device for manufacturing a preform for optical fibres, comprising a chemical deposition chamber including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> at least one gripping member rotatably mounted about an axis Z-Z and adapted to hold at least one elongated element constituting a substrate for chemical deposition for forming a preform for optical fibres; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> at least one burner which is mobile along a direction substantially parallel to said axis Z-Z and adapted to deposit, on said at least one elongated element, a chemical substance for forming a preform; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> at least one suction element placed on the opposite side to said at least one burner with respect to said axis Z-Z and adapted to collect and discharge, from said chemical deposition chamber, exhaust chemical substances; characterised in that said at least one gripping member is associated with a carriage which can be removed from said chemical deposition chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Throughout the present description and the successive claims indistinct use of the term &ldquo;elongated element&rdquo; or &ldquo;cylindrical support&rdquo; will be made to indicate the substrate for chemical deposition from which, at the end of the deposition process, the preform is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Throughout the present description and the successive claims, the term &ldquo;carriage&rdquo; will be used to indicate any element or unit for supporting the cylindrical supports and/or the preforms and which can be removed from the chemical deposition chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the present invention, therefore, allows the positioning of the cylindrical support (before the deposition) and the removal of the preform (after the deposition) in and from the gripping members to be carried out outside the chemical deposition chamber and, possibly, in a position away from it; such operations are thus extremely simplified and thus there is a significantly reduced risk of incurring possible unwanted collisions with the walls of the chamber or of the device inside of which the chemical deposition chamber is defined, or with other elements or parts of the device. The carriage, with the cylindrical support already loaded, is then inserted into the chemical deposition chamber so as to initiate the operations of chemical deposition; at the end of these operations the carriage is taken out from the chamber so that the preform can be easily removed and the successive operations of consolidating the preform can be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The housing of the gripping members in the removable carriage simplifies, moreover, maintenance and/or replacement operations of such members; such operations can indeed be carried out outside of the chemical deposition chamber, more advantageously, in a more suitable space for a more comfortable operation. Even more advantageously, the possibility of carrying out the operations of maintenance of the gripping members, of loading the cylindrical supports in the carriage and of removing the preform from the carriage outside of the chemical deposition chamber allows, during the performance of such operations, the chemical deposition on cylindrical supports loaded on a second carriage to be carried out: in such a way it is possible to significantly increase the productivity of the process of preform formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferably the chemical deposition chamber comprises a first side section for housing said at least one burner, a central section for housing the removable carriage and a second side section, opposite to the first one, for housing said at least one suction element. Even more preferably, the chemical deposition chamber comprises a first side wall equipped, at said central section, with an opening for the insertion and removal of the carriage in and from the chemical deposition chamber, and the carriage comprises a first side surface adapted to close said opening when the carriage is fully inserted in the chemical deposition chamber. Advantageously, the possibility of removing the carriage (and thus the gripping members of the cylindrical support) from the central portion of the chemical deposition chamber facilitates the access and the mobility of the operators inside the chamber; this is particularly advantageous in operations of inspection and maintenance of the chamber and of the elements contained thereinto (burners and suction elements). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the chemical deposition chamber comprises a second side wall opposite to said first side wall and equipped with first abutment elements (for example, bushes) suitable for co-operating, when the carriage is fully inserted into the chemical deposition chamber, with second abutment elements (for example, pins) provided on a second side surface of the carriage opposite to said first side surface. It is thus possible to define in a precise and repeatable manner the working position of the carriage inside the chemical deposition chamber and, therefore, the position of the cylindrical support with respect to the burner and to the suction hood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the carriage comprises a plurality of elements for supporting and moving the same on a floor. Even more preferably, said plurality of elements for supporting and moving the carriage comprises a plurality of spherical elements. Advantageously, the spherical elements give the carriage great freedom of movement in any direction (allowing, amongst other things, also the rotation of the carriage about itself) and facilitate the operations of insertion/removal of the carriage in and from the chemical deposition chamber. Alternatively, the carriage can comprise a plurality of spinning wheels, or other moving elements of the conventional type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the carriage comprises a pair of ledgers equipped with first sliding elements adapted to co-operate with second sliding elements provided inside the chemical deposition chamber at the central section. Even more preferably, said first sliding elements comprise a plurality of sliding rollers and said second sliding elements comprise at least one pair of sliding runners. The presence of such sliding elements contributes, advantageously, to the positioning of the carriage inside the chemical deposition chamber in a position which is reproducible with respect to the burners and to the suction hoods. The arrangement of the sliding rollers and runners can however be inverted, with the rollers mounted in the central section of the chemical deposition chamber and the runners provided on the removable carriage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the device of the invention comprises a first motor adapted to control the rotation of said at least one gripping member about said axis Z-Z through the interposition of a first kinematic chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect thereof, the present invention relates to a device for manufacturing a plurality of preforms for optical fibres, comprising a chemical deposition chamber including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> a plurality of gripping members, each one rotatably mounted about a respective axis Z-Z and adapted to hold one end of a respective elongated element constituting a substrate for chemical deposition for forming a preform for optical fibres; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> a plurality of burners which are mobile along a direction substantially parallel to said axis Z-Z and each of which adapted to deposit, on the respective elongated element, a chemical substance for forming a preform; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> a plurality of suction elements, each of which being placed on the opposite side to a burner of said plurality of burners with respect to the respective axis Z-Z and adapted to collect and discharge, from said chemical deposition chamber, exhaust chemical substances; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> characterised in that said plurality of gripping members is associated with a carriage which is removable from said chemical deposition chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the device of the invention comprises a further plurality of gripping members associated with said removable carriage, for holding the opposite ends of said elongated elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the device of the invention allows the manufacture of a number n of preforms (for example, four) through a simultaneous chemical deposition on such preforms; each preform is manufactured from a respective elongated element (or cylindrical support) which is positioned at a respective pair of gripping members provided on the carriage and on which, in operation, a respective burner and a respective suction element will operate. Such a device allows all the advantages mentioned above to be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect thereof, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a preform for optical fibres inside a chemical deposition chamber, comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> placing at least one elongated element, defining at least one substrate for chemical deposition, in a deposition position inside said chamber; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> depositing on said at least one elongated element at least one chemical substance for forming at least one preform; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> characterised in that said step of placing said at least one elongated element in a deposition position comprises the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> coupling said at least one elongated element with a support unit positioned outside said chemical deposition chamber; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> introducing said support unit in said chemical deposition chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the method of the present invention comprises, at the end of the deposition step of said at least one chemical substance, the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> removing said support unit from said chemical deposition chamber; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> decoupling said at least one preform from said support unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Preferably, said deposition position is vertical.</paragraph>

Each angular transmission member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is in turn kinetically associated with a vertical countershaft <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> (only partially visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) upon which a toothed wheel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is force fitted. Each wheel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> engages, when the carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fully inserted in the chemical deposition chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, with a corresponding toothed wheel <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> arranged on the upper surface of the upper ledger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>; this wheel is integrally connected and coaxial with the chuck <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the device of the present invention, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the horizontal countershaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is integrally connected with the carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and comprises, on one of its free ends, a conical or alternatively toothed clutch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, adapted to be kinetically associated, when the carriage is fully inserted in the chemical deposition chamber, with a corresponding sleeve <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> integrally connected with the motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A plurality of 90&deg; angular transmission members <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (for example, in the specific case described and illustrated here, four transmission members) are kinetically associated to the shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Each angular transmission member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is in turn kinetically associated with a vertical countershaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which is substantially coaxial to the rotational axis Z-Z of the cylindrical supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the systems of movement described above allow to achieve in a simple and functional way both the rotational movement of the cylindrical supports during the operations of chemical deposition, and the removal and insertion of the carriage in the chemical deposition chamber. Moreover, such movement systems offer the advantage of transmitting the motion from a motorisation outside of the carriage to the mobile parts of the carriage without the need of electric or pneumatic connections which would require the intervention of an operator at each insertion/removal of the carriage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment (not shown) of the device of the present invention, all the members for moving the preforms (motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and kinematic chain <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) are integrated in the carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is arranged to allow an electrical connection for the power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As already mentioned, the unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> houses, at section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the chemical deposition chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the burners <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> All the screws and the runners mentioned above are protected from the corrosive acidic substances, which generate during the chemical deposition, through bellows made of sewn and sealed Kevlar material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As already mentioned and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> houses, at the section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the chemical deposition chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, four suction hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The hoods are positioned at a predetermined distance d from each other so as to be arranged in front of the cylindrical supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the opposite side with respect to the burners when the carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fully inserted in the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The suction hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be fixed: in such a case, they extend vertically along the direction Z for a length which is substantially equal to that of the side surfaces of the cylindrical supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on which the chemical deposition takes place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> move together, during the process of chemical deposition, along the vertical direction Z (i.e. parallel to the longitudinal axis Z-Z of the cylindrical supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As said with respect to the burners, the hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are, moreover, preferably capable of moving towards/away from the supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>along the direction X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are preferably placed at a slightly different level to that of the burners in order to optimise the fluid dynamic effects in the area surrounding each cylindrical support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and to facilitate the collection and discharge of exhaust gases. More preferably, the hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are placed at a lower level with respect to the burners and remain always at a lower level during the whole process of chemical deposition. By keeping the hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at a lower level with respect to the burners <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the suction current generated by the hoods themselves tends to oppose the rising effect of the gases caused by the high temperatures, thus keeping the flow of such gases substantially horizontal in the interaction with the preform in formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the provision of a suction hood downstream from the preform along the fluid dynamic path of the gases and reactants and the positioning of the hood at a lower level with respect to that of the burner allows an impact direction of the gas flow on the preform which is substantially perpendicular to the axis of the preform to be maintained. In substance, such an arrangement allows the detachment of the laminar boundary layer (the meaning of which is known in thermal fluid dynamics) from the surface of the preform to be delayed: in such a way, advantageously, an increase in the yield of the process of chemical deposition and an improvement of the characteristics of compactness and uniformity of the preform is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The motion of the hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the direction Z can be synchronised with the motion of the burners, or else, for particular reasons of fluid dynamic optimisation, it is possible to provide for a motion which is different (not synchronised) with respect to that of the burners, and, that is, to provide for a variation in the difference in level between the hoods and the burners; this is allowed by the fact that the systems for moving the hoods and the burners are independent, as described below. Such a variation in level can be required to compensate the variations in temperature which occur inside the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or else to compensate the variation of one or more of the parameters of the deposition process. For example, if during the process the flow rate of the reactant gases needs to be increased, the difference in level between the hoods and the burners is increased to increase the sucking effect towards the bottom generated by the hoods, thus ensuring that the impact trajectory of the gas flow with the preform in formation is substantially perpendicular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are preferably associated with a substantially horizontal supporting ledger (not illustrated) and can be oriented manually. Such a ledger, moreover, supports a substantially horizontal collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for collecting and discharging chemical substances and the particulate generated in the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during chemical deposition. The tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is in turn in fluid communication with an exhaust chamber <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>) through an exhaust opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on a side portion of the wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; this chamber is adapted for taking the exhaust gases to a scrubber, through a heat-resistant tube <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> exhibits a section which is variable and progressively growing as it approaches the exhaust opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The ledger supporting the hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is associated with a first system suitable for allowing the movement of the ledger itself (and thus of the hoods associated with it) in the vertical direction Z and with a second system suitable for allowing the movement of the ledger itself (and thus of the hoods associated with it) in the horizontal direction X towards/away from the cylindrical supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Such systems are substantially identical and specular to those described above which allow the movements along the direction X and Z of the burners; they are, moreover, kinetically independent from these other systems so as to be able to separately and independently control the motion of the burners and the motion of the hoods (such motions, as already stated, can be synchronised or, for reasons of fluid dynamic optimisation, non-synchronised). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> As already stated, the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is associated with the wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, where it inserts into the exhaust chamber <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> at the exhaust opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>). In order to allow the movement in the direction X and Z of the collector tube in section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with respect to the wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the invention preferably comprises a sliding coupling between the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a first embodiment (illustrated in the attached figures) of the device of the present invention, such a coupling takes place, preferably, according to the following conditions: the portion of wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in proximity of the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is defined by a pair of respective upper and lower, with respect to the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, vertical tapes <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which can slide in the direction Z. The tapes <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are preferably made from stainless steel and are integrally associated, at the respective free ends, with an intermediate plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which exhibits a central slot <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> (seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) extended along the direction X for a length equal to or greater than the stroke of the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> towards/away from the cylindrical supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A further plate defining a flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> but not in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> to allow the plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to be seen) is integrally associated with the tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is preferably realised in teflon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> faces the plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> towards the inside of the chamber and is larger than the slot <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> in order to close such a slot even when the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is at its end (base stroke position along the direction X); in this way the chemical deposition chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fluid dynamically connected to the exhaust chamber <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> just through the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which inserts into the chamber <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> at the opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> preferably exhibits runners for the horizontal movement of the flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can alternatively face the plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> towards the outside of the chamber, or else the plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can exhibit a seat inside of which the flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is free to slide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The tapes <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are associated with respective winding/unwinding rollers (not shown) ; such rollers are positioned inside suitable boxes <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>mounted on the wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, above and below, respectively, the rollers themselves. When the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> rises, the upper tape <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>winds up on the roller positioned in the upper box <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, while the lower tape <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>unwinds from the roller positioned in the lower box <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and vice versa. The winding of the tapes on the rollers is made easier by the presence of a winding spring in each of the two boxes <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The movement in direction Z of the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is, therefore, allowed by the sliding in direction Z of the tapes <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>; the movement in direction X, on the other hand, is allowed by the sliding in direction X of the flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> with respect to the two tapes <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the construction material of the hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, of the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and of the ledger supporting the hoods and tube is an anodised hard aluminium alloy (anticorodal); this allows the advantages of resistance to acid corrosion (which can show up after chemical deposition) and of lightness and low cost mentioned above to be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> To move the plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and thus the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, in direction Z, instead of the tape system, a system using &ldquo;accordionlike&rdquo; elements (not shown) can be used. In practice, the tapes <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be replaced with a first and a second &ldquo;accordionlike&rdquo; element which support the plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> from above and below and define respective lower and upper portions (of variable extension) of the wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As a further possible alternative, instead of a system of tapes or using accordionlike elements, a non-sealed system can be used, such as a system comprising two series of opposing horizontal bristles extending from the opposite sides to the space defining the aforementioned side portion of the wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> defined in proximity of the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>; the length of the bristles in each series is slightly greater than half the width of the aforementioned space. In this way, the bristles slightly overlap at the centre-line of the space. The flexibility of the bristles allow them to open and close as the collector tube passes through thus allowing the movement of the tube in direction Z and X. Although such a system does not guarantee a sealing of the inside of the chemical deposition chamber, it is advantageous simply from the constructive and economic point of view: moreover, the lack of a seal is not critical in that most of the exhaust gases are sucked in and discharged through the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</cross-reference>, the wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, i.e. the wall situated behind the burners, exhibits, in its upper part, suitable openings <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> where respective pipe fittings (bulk-heads) are positioned, such pipe fittings being suitable for connecting rigid external tubes (not illustrated) for feeding gas to the chamber to flexible internal tubes (only one of which is represented, indicated with <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>) for transferring gas to the burners. In practice, a flexible tube <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected to each burner for each combustion gas and for each reactant gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> exhibits, moreover, a plurality of air suction members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (preferably a number equal to the number of burners) to provide into the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> an air flow adapted to replace the air discharged by the suction hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment (not illustrated) of the device of the present invention, the air suction members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> substantially extends along the whole wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment (illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the air suction members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> extends along a portion of the wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, in proximity of the single burners, and are mobile in direction Z with a motion which is synchronised with respect to that of the burners along the same direction, so as to be substantially at the same level as the burners during the whole deposition process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a system of sliding tapes similar to those described with reference to the sliding coupling between the collector tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, to allow the motion along the direction Z of the air suction members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In particular, the wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a wide central portion which consists of a pair of respective upper and lower vertical tapes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with respect to the air suction members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Such tapes can be made from rubberised fabric, teflon, metal (preferably steel) and are integrally associated, at the respective free ends, with an intermediate plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Such a plate exhibits, in proximity of the burners, a plurality of openings defining the aforementioned air suction members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is integrally connected with the ledgers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for supporting the burners, so that the air suction members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are kinetically associated with the burners <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The air suction members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be, for example, rectangular, and can have a height of around 35-40 cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The tapes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are associated with respective winding/unwinding rollers (not shown) housed inside suitable boxes <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) mounted on the upper and lower part of the wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively. When the ledgers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> rise, the upper tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>winds up on the roller positioned in the upper box <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while the lower tape <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>unwinds from the roller positioned in the lower box <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and vice versa. The winding of the tapes on the rollers is made easier by the presence of respective winding springs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> To move the plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, instead of a tape system, a system of &ldquo;accordionlike&rdquo; elements (not shown) can be used. In practice, the tapes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be replaced by a first and a second &ldquo;accordionlike&rdquo; element, which support the plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> from above and below and define the respective lower and upper portions (of variable extension) of the wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> More generally, the air suction members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be formed in any element which can be controllably moved in direction Z along the wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, for example through a runner-slide moving system. Such a moving system can be associated with the system for moving the ledgers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, or can be independent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As a further possible alternative, instead of a plurality of air suction members, there can be a single air suction member, having a horizontal extension substantially equal to that of the row of burners <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In the same way as the case of a plurality of air suction members, the single air suction member can be formed in a plate associated with a pair of tapes which slide in the direction Z. Alternatively, the air suction member can be formed in any other element which is capable of moving vertically along the direction Z. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises, moreover, a unit for feeding gas and reactants (not illustrated) positioned outside of the chemical deposition chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and an electric control board (not shown) for controlling the rotation of the preform and the movement of the burners <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the hoods <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> along the directions X and Z. Preferably, the unit for feeding gas and reactants and the electric control board are controlled by a centralised control unit (not illustrated). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In operation, with reference to the embodiment of the device of the invention illustrated in the attached figures, the cylindrical supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are loaded onto the carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> outside of the chemical deposition chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and, possibly, in a position away from it. The carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the supports loaded is then inserted in the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>; such an insertion is made easier by the presence of the sliding rollers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which engage with the sliding runners <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. When the carriage is fully inserted in the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the toothed wheels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, kinetically associated with the motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the kinematic chain <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, engages with the toothed wheels <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> placed on the upper ledger <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>; the actuation of the motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then controls the rotation of the cylindrical supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the process of chemical deposition can thus begin. During such a process the burners and the hoods move along the vertical direction Z and the horizontal direction X through the motion transmission members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>described above. At the end of the deposition process the carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the preforms <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is removed from the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and is moved away from the unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to be able to proceed to the operations of removal of the preforms, which will undergo the successive desiccation and consolidation steps. </paragraph>
