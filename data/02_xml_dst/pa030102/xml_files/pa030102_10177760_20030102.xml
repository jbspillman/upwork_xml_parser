<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a reverse-input shutoff clutch that transmits positive and negative rotational torque from the input side to the output side and does not transmits positive and negative rotational torque from the output side to the input side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> More and more electricity-assisted type trolleys are used as delivery trolleys for home delivery service because of the reasons such as, for example, increasing amount of goods loaded on trolleys, aging delivery personnel, and assimilating women in the industry. It is preferable in this case that trolleys can be electrically assisted for both forward and backward movements and also manually operated when the drive power source is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such a function can be realized using, for example, the clutch disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei. 8-177878, a proposal made by the present applicant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The clutch disclosed in the publication is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, and FIGS. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), provided with an outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an inner ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a torque transmission member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that can be engaged with and disengaged from the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the inner ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in both positive and negative rotation directions, a cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for retaining, through its rotation relative to the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the torque transmission member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and for controlling the engagement and disengagement of the torque transmission means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a centering spring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for connecting the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in a rotation direction, a stationary-side member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> fixed to a stationary system in a rotation direction, and a viscous fluid <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> interposed between the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the stationary-side member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The viscous fluid <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is, for example, a viscous fluid, such as a silicone oil, for applying rotational resistance to the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Rotational torque of a motor (not shown) is transmitted to the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through, for example, worm gear gearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), a plurality of cam faces <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided on the internal periphery of the inner ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at equal spacing in a circumferential direction. Also, wedge gaps, symmetrical in both positive and negative rotation directions, are formed between the cam faces <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the external periphery of the inner ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The torque transmission members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), cylindrically shaped rollers arranged in the wedge gaps, and received and retained in pockets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the centering spring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is coupled to the end faces of both the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, enabling the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to co-rotate with the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, the centering spring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> serves to position the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that the individual torque transmission members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are placed at the centers of the corresponding individual cam faces <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The rotation of the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with respect to the stationary-side member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> causes the viscous fluid <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to apply viscous shearing resistance to the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, resulting in delay in rotation of the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with respect to the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In this way, when positive or negative rotational torque is applied from the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), viscous shearing resistance of the viscous fluid <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> causes the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to delay in rotation with respect to the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As a result, the torque transmission member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is engaged with the corresponding wedge gap between the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the inner ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Consequently, rotational torque applied to the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the inner ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the torque transmission members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Contrary to this, when positive or negative rotational torque (reverse input torque) is applied from the inner ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in reverse to the above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is aligned to the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the centering spring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This way the torque transmission member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is positioned at a center c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the circumferential direction of the cam faces <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In this case, the individual torque transmission members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are disengaged from their corresponding individual wedge gaps to be in a state where the members are uncoupled from both the inner ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the reverse input torque applied to the inner ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not transmitted to the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and torque transmission is thus shut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As described above, the clutch shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> to FIGS. <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is constituted in such a way that viscous shearing resistance of the viscous fluid <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> interposed between the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the stationary-side member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> causes the cage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to delay in rotation with respect to the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this constitution, the following problem is feared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (1) As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, viscous shearing resistance (K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the viscous fluid <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> increases in proportion to the rotational speed (rotational angular speed) of the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, when the rotational speed of the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reaches a predetermined value and the viscous shearing resistance (K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is at a torque (K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) at which the centering spring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is deformed by a specific amount, the torque transmission members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> start to engage with the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the inner ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Then, rotational torque applied to the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the inner ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the torque transmission members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the clutch described above, the outer ring <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is required to rotate at a speed equal to or higher than a specific rotational speed (rotational speed at which the engagement starts) to switch the state of the clutch to a torque transmission state. For this reason, the clutch requires a specific length of time after the rotation drive source starts to rotate until the inner ring starts to rotate, creating a problem of start-up response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (2) The viscosity of the viscous fluid <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> varies depending on temperature, so that a rotational speed at which the engagement starts may change depending on ambient temperature of use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (3) The viscous fluid <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may deteriorate initially given functions of the clutch in long-term use even if the fluid is sealed with seals (such as lip seals or labyrinth seals). This is because friction force at the sealing portions may fluctuate to cause changes in rotational resistance of the seals against the cage or leakage of the viscous fluid. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object-of the invention to provide a novel type of clutch that does not use a viscous fluid as rotational resistance applying means for applying rotational resistance to a cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A reverse-input shutoff clutch according to the invention comprises an input-side rotation member, an output-side rotation member, a torque transmission member that can be engaged with and disengaged from the input-side rotation member and the output-side rotation member in both positive and negative rotation directions, a cage for retaining the torque transmission member and switching between the engagement and disengagement of the torque transmission member through the rotation of the cage relative to the input-side rotation member, a stationary-side member, and rotational resistance applying means for causing friction resistance to act on the cage against its rotation with respect to the stationary-side member. In this constitution, torque transmission is controlled in the following way by the control of a rotational phase difference between the input-side rotation member and the cage. That is, positive and negative rotational torque from the input-side rotation member is transmitted to the output-side rotation member by the engagement of the torque transmission member with the input-side and output-side rotation members, while the transmission of positive and negative rotational torque from the output-side rotation member to the input-side rotation member is shut off by the disengagement of the torque transmission member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the constitution described above, the input-side rotation member and the output-side rotation member may be opposed each other in a radial direction of coaxial rotation shafts or may be opposed each other in an axial direction of coaxial shafts. The &ldquo;input-side rotation member&rdquo; is a member that is rotated by input torque applied from a rotation drive source. Also, the &ldquo;output-side rotation member&rdquo; is a member that can co-rotate with the input-side rotation member through the engagement and disengagement actions of the torque transmission member and also can freely rotate against the input-side rotation member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The input torque applied to the input-side rotation member is transmitted to the cage. The cage is then rotated with respect to the stationary-side member. As a consequence, friction resistance from the rotation resistance applying means is applied to the cage, and the friction resistance causes the cage to have a rotation phase difference with respect to the input-side rotation member. Thus, the torque transmission member is engaged with the input-side and output-side rotation members, and the input torque is transmitted from the input-side rotation member to the output-side rotation member. On the other hand, rotational torque reversely applied to the output-side rotation member does not cause friction force of the rotational resistance applying means to act. Taking advantage of this, the cage and the input-side rotation member are made to rotate with respect to each other to cancel the rotational phase difference between them. In this way, the torque transmission member is centered and disengaged (released from the engaged state) from both the rotation members so that torque transmission to the input-side rotation member can be shut off. The function described above can be secured by, for example, elastically connecting the input-side rotation member and the cage in rotation directions (for example, by connecting them in both positive and negative directions through an elastic member). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Engagement and disengagement actions of the torque transmission member against the input-side rotation member and the output-side rotation member can be realized as an example described below. That is, wedge gaps are formed between the input-side rotation member and the output-side rotation member, and an engagement element as the torque transmission member is wedge-engaged with or disengaged from the wedge gaps. This constitution includes a constitution where cam faces for forming the wedge gaps are provided at the output-side rotation member or the input-side rotation member (where the element with a circular cross section such as a roller or a ball is used as the engagement element) as well as a constitution where cam faces for forming wedge gaps are provided at the engagement element (element such as a sprag is used as the engagement element). The input-side rotation member or the output-side rotation member, having cam faces, are obtainable by directly providing the cam faces on a shaft-shaped member or by fixing a ring-shaped member having cam faces on the shaft-shaped member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In this clutch, the rotational friction applying means for applying friction resistance (sliding friction resistance, for example) to the cage is provided. Accordingly, rotational resistance acting on the cage is independent of rotation speed. This provides the clutch with excellent spin-up response. Therefore, the clutch can also be used, for example, for applications where it is required that rotational torque applied to an input-side rotation member be instantly transmitted to an output-side rotation member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Further, rotational resistance acting on the cage is not affected by temperature, so that operation characteristics of the clutch vary little with changes in ambient temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also, the reverse-input shutoff clutch is characterized in that it allows the output-side rotation member to freely rotate against positive and negative rotational torque applied from the output side. Allowing the output-side rotation member to freely rotate enables, for example, manual operation of an object (such as a door or a wheel) to be driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> This reverse-input shutoff clutch is characterized in that the rotational resistance applying means is a sliding member arranged so that it can be coupled in a circumferential direction to either of the cage and the stationary-side member and can slide against the other. In this reverse-input shutoff clutch, it is arranged in such a way that the sliding member slides, with itself being coupled to the cage in a circumferential directions, against the stationary-side member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This reverse-input shutoff clutch is characterized in that the sliding member is a sliding spring having a sliding portion mounted on the stationary-side member, and a coupling portion which extends in a radial direction and can be coupled to the cage in a circumferential direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> This reverse-input shutoff clutch is characterized in that the sliding member is provided with an annular ring that can be coupled to the cage in a circumferential direction and an elastic member interposed between the annular ring and the stationary-side member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The rotation drive device according to the invention is characterized in that it has a rotation drive source, a speed reduction mechanism portion for reducing rotation torque applied from the rotation drive source, and the reverse-input shutoff clutch according to either of claim 1 or claim 6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A typical device as the &ldquo;rotation drive source&rdquo; includes a motor (a hydraulic motor and pneumatic motor are also included besides an electric motor) and an internal combustion engine. The &ldquo;rotation drive source&rdquo; in this invention, however, includes every kind of equipment that generates rotational force by power such as electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic power, and further includes mechanisms that generate rotational force by manual operation. Further, the constitution of the &ldquo;speed reduction mechanism portion&rdquo; is not limited to any specific one, and includes constitutions formed with a gear mechanism, a worm and wheel mechanism, planetary roller mechanism, cone disc mechanism, or the like. The rotation drive device is further provided with a housing for accommodating the speed reduction mechanism portion and the reverse-input shutoff clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Further, a fully automatic washing machine according to the invention has a wash drum for washing and spin-drying; a wash-drum shaft for rotating the wash drum; a pulsator arranged within the wash drum; a drive power source; a pulsator shaft for rotating the pulsator by input torque applied from the drive power source; and a clutch, arranged between the wash-drum shaft and the pulsator shaft, for controlling the transmission and shutoff of torque that is to be applied to the wash drum. In the constitution above, the clutch is a reverse-input shutoff clutch that comprises an input-side rotation member connected to the pulsator shaft; an output-side rotation member connected to the wash-drum shaft; a_torque transmission member that is interposed between the input-side rotation member and the output-side rotation member and is switchblade between an engagement state for engaging the input-side rotation member and the output-side rotation member and a disengagement state for disengaging both the members; a cage for retaining the torque transmission member and switching between the engagement and disengagement states of the torque transmission member in accordance with a rotational phase difference between the torque transmission member and the input-side rotation member; and rotational resistance applying means for applying rotational resistance through frictional resistance, which occurs when the rotational resistance applying means contacts with a stationary side member, to the cage. The reverse-input shutoff clutch works such that, against rotational torque from the input-side rotation member, the clutch sets the torque transmission member at the engagement state by a rotational phase difference generated by the application of rotational resistance to the cage between the cage and the input-side rotation member, and, against reverse input torque from the outside-side member, the clutch cancels the rotational resistance applied to the cage to eliminate the rotational phase difference so as to set the torque transmission member at the disengagement state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;input-side rotation member,&rdquo; having a clutch face to which and from which the torque transmission member is engaged and disengaged, is directly or indirectly connected to the pulsator shaft. The &ldquo;output-side rotation member,&rdquo; having a clutch face to which and from which the torque transmission member is engaged and disengaged, is directly or indirectly connected to the wash-drum shaft. The output-side rotation member is, through the engagement and disengagement actions of the torque transmission member, rotated together with the input-side rotation member and is freely rotated against the input-side rotation member. Further, the &ldquo;stationary-side member&rdquo; is a member that belongs to a stationary system of which rotation is restricted. The stationary-side member is not necessarily always in a stationary state, and also includes such a member of which-rotation is restricted so that it becomes a stationary-side member when required and of which rotation is allowed in other cases so that it then becomes a rotation-side member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to the constitution described above, input torque applied to the input-side rotation member is transmitted to the cage. Since the cage is rotated against the stationary-side member by the torque applied, frictional resistance from the rotation resistance applying means acts on the cage. The frictional resistance then causes the cage to have a rotational phase difference against the input-side rotation member. As a result, the torque transmission member is in an engagement state so that the input torque is transmitted from the input-side rotation member to the output-side rotation member. Thus, both the pulsator shaft and the wash-drum shaft can be rotated in spin-drying and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when rotational torque is applied in reverse to the output-side rotation member through the wash-drum shaft, friction force induced by the rotational torque applying means does not act on the cage. The torque transmission member is centered to be in a disengagement state when the cage and the input-side rotation member are relatively rotated each other by making use of the characteristic described above so that a rotational phase difference is cancelled. In this way, the transmission of torque from the output-side rotation member (a wash drum-side member) to the input-side rotation member (a pulsator-side member) can be shut off. Accordingly, for washing for example, the wash-drum shaft can be freely rotated in forward and reverse directions so that the wash drum can be rotated by drive force of water streams caused by the rotation of the pulsator. This causes relative rotation between the pulsator and the wash drum that is rotated with inertia in a direction toward which the wash drum was rotated before the rotation direction of the pulsator is switched, and thereby wash capability is enhanced. Further, enhanced wash capability provides an advantage such as shortened wash time which reduces power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In order to realize the function described above, the cage having a rotational phase difference against the input-side rotation member is required to be rotated to a direction in which the rotational phase difference is cancelled. This can be achieved when a spring element such as a centering spring, for example, is used to connect elastically in a rotation direction the input-side rotation member and the cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The engagement and disengagement actions of the torque transmission member can be realized respectively, for example, by the wedging engagement and disengagement of a coupling member as the torque transmission member in or from a wedge gap that is formed between the input-side rotation member and the output-side rotation member. This constitution includes a constitution where a cam face that forms the wedge gap is provided at the input-side rotation member or at the output-side rotation member (in this constitution, a member having a circular cross section, such as a roller or a ball, is used as the coupling member) and a constitution where a cam face that forms the wedge gap is provided at the coupling member (a member such as a sprag is used as the coupling member in this constitution). An input-side rotation member or output-side rotation member, having a cam face, is obtainable by providing the cam face directly on a shaft-shaped element or by fixing a ring-shaped element having the cam face to a shaft-shaped element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> This reverse-input shutoff clutch is provided with the rotational resistance applying means that applies rotational resistance, induced by frictional resistance (sliding frictional resistance, for example), to the cage. Accordingly, rotational resistance that acts on the cage is independent of rotational speed. This fact provides the reverse-input shutoff clutch an advantage of being excellent in start-up response. Therefore, in a fully automatic washing machine, rotational torque applied to the input-side rotation member (pulsator shaft) can be. instantly transmitted to the output-side rotation member (wash-drum shaft). Further, rotational resistance acting on the cage is not affected by temperature; therefore, it is also a feature of the clutch whose dynamic characteristics rarely vary in the changes in ambient temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> This reverse-input shutoff clutch can be constituted such that it can be switched between an operation state where input torque is transmitted from the input-side rotation member to the output-side rotation member and a non-operation state where the transmission of input torque from the output-side rotation member to the input-side rotation member is shut off. In such a constitution, the transmission of torque from the input-side rotation member to the output-side rotation member is shut off when the reverse-input shutoff clutch is set at the non-operation state, so that the wash-drum shaft can be freely rotated as described above. While, when the reverse-input shutoff clutch is switched at the operation state for spin-drying, rotational torque from the input-side rotation member is transmitted to the output-side rotation member; therefore both the pulsator shaft and the wash-drum shaft can be rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Switching of the reverse-input shutoff clutch between the operation and non-operation states described above can also be made by switching the rotational resistance applying means between its contact and non-contact states against a stationary-side member. That is, when the rotational resistance applying means is contacted with a stationary-side member, frictional resistance generated through the contact applies rotational resistance to the cage. The torque transmission member can be thus set at the engagement state. On the other hand, when the rotational resistance applying means is brought to a non-contact state against a stationary-side member, frictional resistance is removed to reduce rotational resistance applied to the cage. The torque transmission member can be thus brought to the disengagement state. For example, when a control member, provided at the reverse-input shutoff clutch, is restricted for rotation, the control member becomes the stationary-side member described above. Thus, through the contact of the control member with the rotational resistance applying means, the reverse-input shutoff clutch can be in the operation state. While, when the control member is removed of the rotational restriction, the control member starts to rotate (the control member is not the stationary-side member in this case). Since the rotational resistance applying means is thus in the non-contact state against the stationary-side member, rotational resistance that is applied to the cage becomes smaller, and the reverse-input shutoff clutch is in the non-operation state.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the invention will be described below referring to the attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show a reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of an outer-ring input type according to a first embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with an input inner ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as an input-side rotation member, an output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as an output-side rotation member, rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a torque transmission member, a cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for retaining the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as an elastic member for positioning the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as a stationary-side member, and a sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as rotational resistance applying means for causing slide friction resistance to act on the cage against the rotation of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected, either directly or indirectly through power transmission means such as chain, to a drive portion (not shown; constituted with, for example, an electric motor and a speed reduction mechanism). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, arranged at the inside diameter side of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Also, the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided with a hollow cylinder portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>opposing the inner periphery of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a flange portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extending from an end of the hollow cylinder portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>toward the rotation center, and a hollow shaft portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>extending from the flange portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>along the rotation shaft. A washer installation portion is formed on the end face at the outer periphery side of the flange portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Also, a washer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is installed at the washer installation portion in such a way that it straddles the flange portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from coming out of position. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, on the inner periphery of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, there are formed at equal spacing in a circumferential direction a plurality (with the number same as that of the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) of cam faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>between the inner periphery of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the outer periphery of the hollow cylinder portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The cam faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>form wedge gaps sl that symmetrically reduce their gaps toward both positive and negative rotation directions. The dimension of the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a radial direction at the centers c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction is larger than the diameter of the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Also, the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> symmetrically reduces from the center c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction toward both positive and negative rotation directions. When the roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is at the center c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction of the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can rotate on its own axis within the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At this time, because the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are not engaged with respect to each other in a rotation direction, rotational torque reversely applied to the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not transmitted to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and shut off. When the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> move in a circumferential direction from the centers c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to either a positive or negative rotation direction and are engaged with reduced parts of the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are coupled to each other through the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As a result, rotational torque from the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Further, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show, a centering spring installation portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for installing a centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed in an axial direction at the inner periphery of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> With the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> being retained in pockets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed at equal spacing in a circumferential direction, the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided with retaining portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>arranged between the inner periphery of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the hollow cylinder portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a flange portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>extending, at the side axially opposing the flange portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, from the retaining portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>toward the inside diameter side of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>projecting in an axial direction, at the inner side of the hollow cylinder portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, from the flange portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>A centering spring installation portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>for installing the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed at the retaining portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows, an elastic member of a substantially U-shaped cross section, the bottom portion of the U-shape is fitted into the centering spring installation portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the upper ends of the U-shape are coupled to the centering spring installation portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> transmits rotational torque applied to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and it also works as a reverse-input shutoff clutch for shutting off rotational torque reversely applied to the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. More specifically, when rotational torque is applied to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> applies rotational resistance induced by slide friction resistance to the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This causes the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to elastically deform to give a rotational phase difference (to a direction of rotational delay) to the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this state where the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has the rotational delay, the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are engaged with the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and rotational torque applied to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, slide friction resistance of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is not generated against rotational torque reversely applied from the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> acts on the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to center it, thereby canceling a rotational phase difference between the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this state where the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is being centered, the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are positioned at the centers c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction of the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and they can rotate on their own axes. Therefore, the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> freely rotates against rotational torque reversely applied from the output side, and thus the reverse input torque is shutoff against the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Described below is the action of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that gives rotational resistance to the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when rotational torque is applied to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> (1) In an initial state where rotational torque is not yet applied to the input inner ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is , as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, centered by the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> received in the pocket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is positioned at the center c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction of the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the cam face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the hollow cylinder portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> (2) When rotational torque of, for example, a clockwise direction as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is applied, the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> starts to rotate together with the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This is because the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. After rotating a specific angle, the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> reaches a state where the projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>d of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> contacts the coupling piece <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> at the forward side in a rotation direction of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or at the right-hand side of the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> (3) When the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> further rotates, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> co-rotates, with the projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> being in contact with the coupling piece <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. As the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> rotates in a sliding manner on the boss portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, it is subjected to slide friction resistance. This slide friction resistance is transmitted from the coupling piece <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to the projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and becomes rotational resistance of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, rotational resistance (torque) of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> caused by the slide friction resistance of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is larger than elastic force (spring torque) of the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is elastically deformed, and the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> delays in rotation with respect to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by an extent corresponding to a degree of the deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> (4) The rotational delay of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> caused by the elastic deformation of the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> causes the roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> retained in the pocket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>a to be engaged with the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the cam face of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the outer periphery of the hollow cylinder portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This causes rotational torque applied to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be transmitted to the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> This is how rotational torque applied to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Also, additionally, when the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> stops to rotate, the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are disengaged from the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by restoring force of the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and centered at the centers c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction of the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> It may happen that the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are kept engaged with the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> even if the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has stopped to rotate. This occurs when, for example, engaging force (residual torque) acting on the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is larger than restoring force of the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> If this occurs; the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be disengaged from the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the following way. That is, rotational torque in a counterclockwise direction (direction opposite to that of the applied rotational torque) is applied (with reverse rotation means arranged) to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is moved in a counterclockwise direction (by being rotated in the reverse direction) with respect to the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and thus the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be disengaged from the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Once this has been done, the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is centered by restoring force of the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the rollers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> move to the centers c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction of the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the initial state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> What is described above is a case where rotational torque in a clockwise direction is applied to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>; however, the same actions and functions as described above are applicable to a case where rotational torque in a counterclockwise direction is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The response of the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> above will now be described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows, when the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> starts to rotate, the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> connected to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> starts to co-rotate with the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. When the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has rotated a specific angle, the projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in contact with the coupling piece <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the forward side in a rotation direction at the right-hand side of the figure. In the figure, the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> rotates &agr; degrees at maximum until the projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the coupling piece <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are in contact with each other. It may occur that the projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the coupling piece <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are already in contact with each other in an initial state. In such a case, the rotation angle of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> until the projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the coupling piece <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> contact each other is 0 degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Next, when the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> deflects to cause the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to delay in rotation with respect to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is engaged with the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This causes the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be coupled to each other through the roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and rotational torque applied to the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. At this time, the rotation angle of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is angle &bgr; (degrees) that is an angle from the center c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction of the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> until the roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> engages with the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating what has been described above. In the figure, the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> rotates by angles between 0 to &agr; degrees after it starts to rotate until the projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> contacts the coupling piece <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In this angle range, rotational resistance does not act on the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> deflects to cause the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to have rotational delay of a specific angle and the magnitude of slide friction resistance (torque K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) acting on the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> reaches a level of an elastic force (torque K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) of the centering spring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (rotation angle of &bgr; degrees), the roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> engages with the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to transmit rotational torque to the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the rotation angle (switch angle) of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the start of the rotation of the input outer ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the angle at which rotational torque is transmitted to the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is between &bgr; and (&bgr;&plus;&agr;) degrees. In this case, the response of the clutch can be adjusted by adjusting the values of the angles &agr; and &bgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Slide friction resistance of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is thus independent of rotation speed as described above; therefore, the response of the clutch can be improved. Also, because slide friction resistance is not affected by changes in ambient temperature, the problem that clutch characteristics change depending on changes in temperature is almost eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment of the invention has been described above; however, the constitution of the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not limited to the above. For example, the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for applying rotational resistance to the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is replaceable with the rotational resistance applying structure shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), a groove-shaped coupling portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed on the outer periphery of the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Also, a projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>&prime; of the cage is received in the annular-shaped coupling portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>By doing so, the coupling portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>b and the projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>&prime; of the cage are coupled to each other in both positive and negative rotation directions. Thus, the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, actuated by the rotation of the cage, co-rotates. The sliding spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a ring member, having ends, made of a corrugated elastic member bent into an annular shape and split up at a portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>rising toward the outside-diameter side of the outer periphery of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> contacts the inner periphery <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Also, portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>falling toward the inside contact the outer periphery <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; of the boss portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c&prime;. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the constitution described above, when rotational torque is applied to the input outer ring (not shown), the cage co-rotates with the input outer ring by the connecting action of the centering spring. Further, the front face in a rotation direction of the projection portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>&prime; of the cage contacts an end face of the coupling portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Thus rotational torque is applied to the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to cause it to co-rotate. When the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> starts to be rotated by rotational torque applied to it, the sliding spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> contacting both the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the boss portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; is rotated while being subjected to slide friction resistance. The slide friction resistance of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> becomes rotational resistance to the cage through the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> It is sufficient for the sliding spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> if it is such a member that contacts both the boss portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; and the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, while being between them, to cause slide friction resistance to act on the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the sliding spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is not limited to the embodiment described above. For example, it may be an elastic member (such as a rubber member) interposed between the boss portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; and the annular ring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> so as to contact both of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, a second embodiment of the invention will be described below, where the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of an inner ring input type is applied to an axle shaft portion of an electricity-assisted trolley. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, provided with a clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> mounted on a axle shaft <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as a an input-side rotation member, a clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> mounted on a housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as an output-side rotation member, rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> as torque transmission members, a cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> as an elastic member, a vehicle-body frame <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and a sliding spring installation ring <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, both of which as stationary-side members, and a sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for applying rotational resistance to the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The connection between the axle shaft <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as well as that between the housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be made by means such as a multi-faced joint structure, spline, serration or key. The &ldquo;multi-faced joint structure&rdquo; means, in general, a connection structure where one or a plurality of flat portions are respectively provided on both the internal periphery of a boss and on the outer periphery of a shaft to be inserted into the boss. When the two are fitted to each other at the flat portions, they are secured in a rotation direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The axle shaft <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is directly connected to or connected through power transmission means such as chain to a drive portion (not shown; constituted with an electric motor and a speed reduction mechanism, for example). Also, the axle shaft <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported in a cantilever manner at one end side (left-hand side of the figure; at the middle side of the axle shaft <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>) of the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a vehicle-body frame <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through a roller bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The roller bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is a sealed type having a seal installed at each of its end portions or at its one side at an end-face side of the clutch. The clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is fitted and fixed onto the outer periphery of the axle shaft <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in the figure, the housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> constitutes a hub connected to a wheel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A flange portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>extending in a radial direction, is formed in a unitized manner on the outer periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the wheel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is connected to the flange portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through hub bolts (not shown). A tire <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is mounted on the wheel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is fitted and fixed into the inner periphery at one end side of the housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the wheel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be unitized together. Further, the housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported by the axle shaft <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> through two roller bearings <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that are arranged with spacing in an axial direction.

The clutch having the supporting structure arranged in this way can endure high speed and high load operations. Also, using a sealed type as the roller bearing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the roller bearing <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> positioned respectively at one end side and the other end side of the clutch makes foreign matter, such as dust, mud or water, difficult to enter into the inside of the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is an open ring-shaped elastic member fitted on the inner periphery of the sliding spring installation ring <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and provided with coupling pieces <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of which both are end-portions of the opening bent toward the inside diameter side.

When the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> rotates, it contacts either of the coupling pieces <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>positioned at the forward in a rotation direction of the opening end portions of the hollow cylinder-shaped portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>causing the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to co-rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> transmits rotational torque applied to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the axle shaft <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Also, the clutch serves as a reverse-input shutoff clutch for shutting off rotational torque applied to the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. That is, when rotational torque is applied to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> applies rotational resistance, induced by slide friction, to the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This results in elastic deformation of the centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, thereby causing rotational delay of the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. When the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has delay in rotation, the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are engaged with the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and rotational torque applied to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> through the roller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, slide friction resistance of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is not generated against rotational torque applied from the housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. In this case, the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is kept centered by the action of the centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. In a state where the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is being centered, the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are positioned at the centers c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction of the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and can rotate on their own axes. Therefore, rotational torque from the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is shut off against the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Detailed description will be made below for action of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that applies rotational resistance to the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> when rotational torque is applied to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> (1) In an initial state where rotational torque is not yet applied to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is being centered by the centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Also, the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> received in the pockets <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, being positioned at the centers in a circumferential direction of the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the cam faces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the inner periphery <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> (2) When rotational torque, for example, in a counterclockwise direction in the figure is applied to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> starts to rotate with the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, because the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is connected to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with the centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Further, when the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has rotated a specific angle, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, it is a state where a side face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the backward side in a rotation direction of the opening portion of the hollow cylinder-shaped portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> contacts the coupling piece <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> (3) When the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> further rotates, the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> co-rotates, with the hollow cylinder-shaped portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> being in contact with the coupling piece <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rotates in a sliding manner on the inner periphery of the sliding spring installation ring <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, it is subjected to slide friction resistance as it rotates. The slide friction resistance is transmitted from the coupling piece <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the hollow cylinder-shaped portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and becomes rotational resistance of the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the rotational resistance (torque) of the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> caused by the slide friction resistance of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is larger than elastic force (spring torque) of the centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Consequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the elastic centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> elastically deforms, and the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> starts to delay in rotation with respect to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by an extent corresponding to the degree of the deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (4) The rotational delay of the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> caused by the elastic deformation of the centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> causes the roller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> received in the pocket <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to be engaged with the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the cam faces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the inner periphery <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. This causes rotational torque applied to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be transmitted to the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> through the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Because slide friction resistance of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is independent of rotation speed, the hollow cylinder-shaped portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> couples to the coupling piece <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when rotational torque is applied to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Then the centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> deflects, the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are engaged with the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and rotational torque is transmitted to the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, the wheel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the tire <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, mounted on the housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, are rotated by the rotational torque applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> This is how rotational torque applied to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the clutch outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Also, when the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> stops to rotate, the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are disengaged from the wedge gap s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by restoring force of the centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and centered at the centers c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction of the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> It may occur, however, that the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are kept engaged with the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> even after the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has stopped to rotate. This occurs when, for example, engagement force (residual torque) acting on the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is larger than restoring force of the centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> If this happens, the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> can be disengaged from the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the following way. That is, rotational torque in a clockwise direction (direction opposite to that of applied rotational torque) is applied (with reverse rotation means arranged) to both the axle shaft <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Then the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in a clockwise direction (by being rotated in the reverse direction) with respect to the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and thus the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> can be disengaged from the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Once this has been done, the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is centered by restoring force of the centering spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> move to the centers c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction of the wedge gaps s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the initial state. What is described above is a case where rotational torque in a counterclockwise direction is applied to the clutch inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>; however, the same process applies to a case where rotational torque in a clockwise direction is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment according to the invention has been described; however, the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not limited to the details disclosed and described above. For example, the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for applying rotational resistance to the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is replaceable with the rotational resistance applying structure shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Although the reverse-input shutoff clutch according to the invention has been described above, the invention is not limited to those described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> For example, rotational resistance applying means for causing slide friction resistance to act on a cage against the rotation of the cage with respect to a stationary-side member may be constituted as follows. That is, the means may be such that the cage and the stationary-side member are directly contact each other (or such that, at either of the cage or the stationary-side member, a member contacting the other of the two is provided so that the cage and the stationary-side member indirectly contact each other). When arranged this way, the cage rotates while it contacts the stationary-side member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Further, in the embodiments of both the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the sliding spring <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) as a sliding member is coupled to the cage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>), respectively, and slides against the stationary-side member. The arrangement of the rotational resistance applying means is not limited to this. For example, the rotational resistance applying means can be arranged in such a way that it slides, with itself being coupled to the stationary-side member in a circumferential direction and in a stationary state, against the cage that is rotating. In this case, when the cage rotates with respect to the stationary-side member, the sliding member causes slide friction resistance to act on the cage. Further, the sliding member may be made of, for example, an elastic member such as a spring. Further, this sliding member may also be a member provided with an annular ring and an elastic member that are arranged in the following way, respectively. That is, the annular ring is arranged in position with a specific spacing in a radial direction kept from the cage and coupled to the stationary-side member in a circumferential direction. Also the elastic member is, while contacting both the annular ring and the stationary-side member, interposed in a space continuous in a circumferential direction between the annular ring and the cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above can be assembled into not only the electricity-assisted trolley, but also into various mechanisms and devices. One of the examples is its applications for drive mechanisms of systems such as electricity-driven curtains or electricity-assisted wheel chairs. In such applications, an object to be operated is driven by a rotation drive source such as a motor, while it is also required that the object are manually operated. In such a case, the required function is obtainable by interposing the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the torque transmission path between the rotation drive source and the object to be driven. That is, in this clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, because an output-side rotation member (such as the output inner ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) freely rotates against reverse-input torque applied from the output side, an element as an object to be driven such as a curtain system or a wheel can be manually moved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Further, when the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assembled into drive sources for different kinds of doors of an automobile, such as a rear door, side door, sliding door, trunk door, and engine hood, opening and closing can be made not only with assistance of electricity, but the operation can also be made manually with ease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the reverse-input shutoff clutch can be assembled into a paper-feed mechanism of a copy machine or a printer. A paper-feed mechanism has, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>, a structure to drive paper-feed rollers <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> with a motor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> through speed reduction gearing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In this paper-feed mechanism, paper jamming may occur by some reason or other, and when it occurs, a jammed paper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> must be pulled out by hand with the motor being stopped. The paper-feed rollers <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> rotate as the paper is pulled for removal, and torque of the motor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> connected to the paper-feed rollers is applied to the paper, making the pulling out work difficult. Particularly in the fixing portion, a large nip pressure P is applied to the rollers <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the motor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to exert large torque. Therefore the pulling out of the paper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> involves difficulty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a one-way clutch <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> has been assembled between the motor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the paper-feed rollers <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The one-way clutch enable the rollers <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to be freely rotated in one direction, or the direction to pull out the paper illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> (same direction as the paper feeding, shown by the arrow), so that motor torque is not applied to the paper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In this case, however, because the direction of pulling the paper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is limited to one direction, the pulling out of the paper becomes difficult depending on which part of the paper the jamming has occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, when the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is arranged between the motor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the paper-feed rollers <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, drive force from the motor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the paper-feed rollers while enabling the jammed paper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> be pulled out from both directions (upward or downward direction in the figure) of roller shafts <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, facilitating work of releasing the jammed paper. Further, when a paper is fed from low-speed rollers (not shown) located at the upstream side, the reverse-input shutoff clutch connected to high-speed rollers at the downstream side freely rotates to absorb the difference in speed between the rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows a case where the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assembled into the drive portion of an automatic door system (electric-powered sliding door). The drive portion transmits rotational torque of a motor <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> or the like to a pulley <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> through the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to drive a belt <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> wound on the pulley <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A linear bearing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is connected to the belt <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> through a connection member <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The linear bearing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is guided with a rail <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> extending along a movement direction (perpendicular to this paper face) of a door <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Also, the lower part of the door <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is connected to the linear bearing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> through a support member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. When the motor <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is driven in a positive or negative direction, the pulley <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the belt <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> rotates in a positive or negative direction through the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby reciprocally sliding the linear bearing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and further the door <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In an ordinary automatic door, it is arranged such that a pedestrian approaching the door is detected with a sensor <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and then the motor <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is driven. In this case, therefore, once the sensor <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> fails, the door <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> cannot be opened or closed unless power supply to the motor is cut out. On the other hand, when the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assembled into the drive portion as show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the door <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can be manually opened and closed with ease without cutting out the power supply to the motor even when the sensor <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> fails. This is because the output shaft of the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be freely rotated in both directions for opening and closing the door <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Further, the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be assembled into the rear axle shaft of a bicycle. Generally, in the rear axle shaft of a bicycle, power from the pedals is transmitted to the rear wheel through a ratchet type one-way clutch, where free rotation of the ratchet wheel creates sounds (clicking sounds) when the bicycle is reversed. On the other hand, with the reverse-input shutoff clutch assembled in the axle shaft, this kind of sound is not created, thereby enhancing a quality image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Further, the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be assembled into a screw-propeller portion of a ship such as a boat. In a boat, generally, the propeller is driven with the engine of which power is transmitted to the propeller through a clutch and transmission shaft. Therefore, when trying to advance a boat with inertia with the engine stopped, the boat is subjected to rotational resistance of the transmission shaft in addition to resistance from the propeller. When the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is interposed between the transmission shaft and the propeller, the propeller alone can be allowed to rotate when a boat advances with inertia, reducing resistance to improve operation capability of the boat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows a case where the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assembled into a rotary driving part of an fully automatic washing machine that conducts washing, rinsing, and spin-drying using one washing drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In this fully automatic washing machine, a pulsator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is rotatably arranged at the center of the upper face of the bottom of a washing drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a hollow washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected to the lower part at the center of the bottom. The washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided with an upper shaft portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a lower shaft portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and both the shaft portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to each other through a brake drum portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>having a large diameter. The upper shaft portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is rotatably supported by a washing machine frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through an upper bearing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and the lower shaft portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is rotatably supported by the washing machine frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through a lower bearing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>A one-way brake, or a brake belt B for example, is arranged on the outer periphery of the brake drum portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>The washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is subjected to braking force when the brake belt B is pressed against the brake drum portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The pulsator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is connected to a pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which is rotatably inserted through the bore portion of the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is provided with an upper shaft portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a lower shaft portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Both the shaft portions <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to each other through a speed reduction mechanism, or, for example, a planetary-gear speed reduction mechanism (figure omitted), arranged in the bore portion of the brake drum portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Further, the pulsator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is connected to the shaft end of the upper shaft portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and power transmission means such as a drive pulley <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is connected to the shaft end of the lower shaft portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Positive and negative torque is applied to the drive pulley <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from a drive source (not shown), such as an electric motor, through power transmission means such as a belt. Thus the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and further the pulsator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are rotated in positive and negative directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for controlling transmission and shutting off the torque transmitted from the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is interposed between the lower shaft portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the lower shaft portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> used in this example is the inner ring input type described referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In the description below, the members and elements having the same functions and actions as those of the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are denoted by the like numerals, and the descriptions of such members and elements are omitted. In this embodiment, a ring-shaped control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is substituted for the sliding spring installation ring <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In this reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the switching of the states between an operation state and a non-operation state is made possible in addition to the function described above of shutting off reverse-input torque. The operation state means a state for transmitting torque, applied to the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, to the outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and the non-operation state means a state for shutting off the transmission of torque, applied to the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, to the outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The switching between the two states can be conducted by restricting the rotation of the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the removal of the restriction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> First, a case where the rotation of the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is restricted will be described below. The control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a stationary-side member in this case. When torque is applied to the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in this state, the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is rotated by torque applied from the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through a centering spring (not shown; the spring <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> can be used, for example). At this time, the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> applies rotational resistance, induced by its slide friction resistance, to the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which results in deformation of the centering spring to cause the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to delay in rotation. In this case, the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> come to the engaged state, so that rotational torque applied to the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> through the rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, friction resistance of the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is not generated by reverse-input torque applied to the outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and therefore the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is centered by the action of the centering spring. Consequently, the rollers are disengaged from the wedge gaps, and the transmission of torque from the outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is shut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Next, a case where the rotation restriction is removed from the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will be described. When torque is applied in this state to the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, in the same way as the case of the operation state, the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is rotated by the torque applied from the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through the centering spring. At this time, however, because the rotation restriction to the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has been removed, the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> synchronously rotates with the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or rotates with delay with respect to the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This occurs because of friction force generated at a contact portion between the inner periphery of the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or at a contact portion between the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a cage ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> installed at an end face of the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. That is, in this case, the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is not a stationary-side member but is a rotation-side member. Also, in this case, the relationship between the spring torque K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the centering spring and friction torque K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> generated by the sliding spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is expressed by K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt;K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the centering spring does not deflect, and the cage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> rotates while it is being centered with respect to the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in both cases described above, the rollers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> do not engage with the wedge gaps and are in a state where they are disengaged from the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, the transmission of input torque from the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is shut off, and the inner ring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the outer ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are in a state where they can freely rotate with respect to each other. In this way, the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be set at the non-operation state by removing the rotation restriction of the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, switching the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between the operation and non-operation states, or the switching the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> between the state of the rotation restriction and the state where the restriction is removed, is made by a operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> shown as an example in the figure is arranged in a manner where it can swing about a specific axis, and provided with a coupling element that can be coupled to the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is swung and operated by operation means, such as wire or an arm, and switched between the position (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;restriction position&rdquo;) where the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is restricted for rotation by the coupling of the operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to a coupling portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> provided on the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the position (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;removal position&rdquo;) where the rotation restriction is removed from control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by the uncoupling of the operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> from the coupling portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The switching of the operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is made in an automatic manner that is interlocked with the switching between a washing and spin-drying modes of the fully automatic washing machine. The operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be constituted in such a way that it can move forwards and backwards in a radial direction with respect to the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. By doing so, switching the control member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> between the rotation restriction and the restriction removal is made by operating the operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> forwards and backwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> When the fully automatic washing machine is at the washing mode, the operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is kept at the removal position and the brake belt B is kept at the non-operation state (where the brake belt B is not in contact with the brake drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). When the operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is at the removal position, the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the non-operation state. Accordingly, transmission of torque between the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shut off by the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can freely rotate with respect to each other. When positive and negative torque is applied in this state to the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> from an electric motor (not shown), the transmission of torque from the pulsator <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shut off by the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The input torque is therefore applied only to the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which causes the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the pulsator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to rotate in positive and negative directions. Consequently, water streams are generated in the washing drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as the pulsator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> rotates in positive and negative directions. Since both the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the brake belts B are being kept in the non-operation state, the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the washing drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are freely rotated in both positive and negative directions by drive force of the water streams. Therefore, at the time when a rotation direction is switched, relative rotation occurs between the pulsator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the washing drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that still rotates with inertia in the direction to which the washing drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> had been rotating before the switching, thereby enhancing washing capability of the washing machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> When the fully automatic washing machine is set at the spin-drying mode upon completion of washing, the operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is switched to the restriction position. When the operation member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is at the restriction position, the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the operation state. Accordingly, torque is transmitted between the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When torque in a specific direction (positive or negative direction) is applied in this state to the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> from an electric motor (not shown), the applied torque is transmitted to the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through the clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This results in the synchronized rotation of the pulsator shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus the washing drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> rotates in a specific direction to conduct spin-drying. When the fully automatic washing machine comes to the stop mode after completing the spin-drying, the electric motor stops and the brake belt B is switched to the operation state. With the operation of the brake belt B, the washing-drum shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the washing drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> stop to rotate to complete the spin-drying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In a conventional fully automatic washing machine, various controls described above have been made using a brake belt, one-way clutch, and spring clutch. When the reverse-input shutoff clutch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used, however, the number of clutch elements is reduced by one from a conventional fully automatic washing machine. Thus the structure is more compact and simpler, and also costs are reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The reverse-input shutoff clutch according to the invention is provided with rotational resistance applying means for causing friction resistance to act on a cage against its rotation with respect to a stationary-side member. Therefore, rotational resistance acting on the cage is independent of the rotation speed of the cage and determined by the rotation angle of the cage. As a result, the problem of start-up response is improved so that rotational torque applied to an input-side rotation member is instantly transmitted to an output-side rotation member. Also, because rotational resistance acting on the cage is not affected by temperature, operation characteristics of the clutch change little in changes in ambient temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The rotation drive device according to the invention is assembled with the clutch described above. Therefore, the problem of start-up response is improved and rotational torque applied from a rotation drive source is relatively quickly transmitted to an output-side rotation member. Also, operation characteristics of the clutch change little even when ambient temperature changes. Further, a member as an object to be driven can also be manually operated by allowing an output-side rotation member to freely rotate against rotational torque from an output side. This further expands application fields of the clutch. </paragraph>
