<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a method for preventing and controlling perspiration wetness in humans which comprises applying to the underarm area an effective amount of a composition of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> What follows now is a more detailed description of the ingredients which are included in the compositions of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As has been noted above, the compositions of the invention are essentially free of glycols and low to middle chain alcohols. However, glycols normally are used in gelled cosmetic compositions to raise the refractive index of the water phase and thereby match the refractive index of the water phase to the refractive index of the oil phase and thereby obtain a clear composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Without simple glycols, another means must be found to raise the refractive index of the water phase of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, this is accomplished by using inclusions other than simple glycols in the water phase. More specifically, said deodorant or antiperspirant active can have this refractive index raised by combining it with a non-simple glycol compound that is water soluble, and raises the refractive index of the water phase and is not deleterious to the properties of the antiperspirant or deodorant active, or to the esthetics of the final composition. Such compounds are preferably are polymeric ethylene oxide glycol adducts as described herein. Such compounds may also be compounds which have a carboxylate group. Preferably such compounds can include an amino acid such as glycine, alanine or d1-trytophan. Alternatively other inorganic salts such as water soluble salts or more preferably monovalent, divalent, trivalent salts including sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, calcium chloride, calcium sulfate, magnesium chloride, aluminum salts and mixtures thereof can be added to the water phase to raise the refractive index thereof. Other examples include salts of organic acids such as sodium lactate, acetamide MEA and lactamide MEA. Also urea and other salts of amino acids may be utilized such as zinc glycinate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Such inclusions may be mixtures of all of the compounds set forth just above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An advantage to using this method for matching refractive indices is that it achieves compositions that are not sticky or tacky during drydown or after the user has re-perspired. Another advantage is that this represents an inexpensive way to obtain clear compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Deodorant or Antiperspirant Actives </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Nonlimiting examples of said deodorant or antiperspirant actives which have been combined with the just above mentioned compounds are as follows: antiperspirant complexes using the antiperspirant salts which are known in the art. For example, 3,792,068 Luedders et al., herein incorporated by reference, discloses complexes of aluminum, zirconium and amino acids such as glycines. Complexes such as those disclosed in Luedders and other similar complexes are commonly known as ZAG(OR Zag). ZAG complexes are chemically analyzable for the presence of aluminum, activated ZAG compounds and chlorine. ZAG complexes useful herein are identified by the specification of both the molar ratio of aluminum to zirconium (the Al:Zr ratio) and the molar ratio of total metal to chlorine (metal:Cl) ZAG complexes useful herein have an Al:Zr ratio of from about 1.67 to about 12.5 and a metal:Cl ratio of about 0.73 to about 1.93. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Another patent which discloses ZAG compounds is U.S. Pat. No. 4,985,238 to Tanner et al. This just-mentioned patent is herein incorporated by reference. Preferred ZAG complexes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,985,238 to Tanner et al. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The Oil Phase </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The oil phase of compositions of the invention can be a blend of liquids which include a polyorganosiloxane, such as DC9010, DC9040 or more preferably dimethicone or cyclomethicone, such as DC 245 or DC345. Dimethicone is available from Dow Corning under the name DC-225and DC200 fluid and it has a refractive index of about 1.3995. Other non-silicone liquids which can be included in the oil phase of nonlimiting of compositions of the invention include, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, and diisopropyl sebacate.

Moreover, various of these coupling agents, aid in drying and has a cooling effect, providing advantageous aesthetic properties for the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The coupling agent can be one compound or a mixture of compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Illustratively, the coupling agent is present in an amount of from about 0.01% to about 8.5% by weight, preferably from about 0.5% to about 8.5% by weight, of the total weight of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Optional Ingredients </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Compositions of the invention can further comprise other cosmetic ingredients such as fragrances, colorants, emollients, preservatives, and thickeners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Optically clear compositions using ingredients described above can be achieved by matching the refractive index of the oil phase with the refractive index of the water phase. This is done by combining the ingredients of the oil phase and measuring the refractive index of the resulting oil phase, at about room temperature, which is about 21&deg; C. Then the ingredients which comprise the aqueous phase are mixed and its refractive index is measured at room temperature, 210C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> If necessary, in order to match the refractive index of the water phase to that of the oil phase, water can be added to the water phase (to lower total water phase refractive index) In order to raise water phase refractive index, the level of the water soluble salt, amino acid or other non-glycol, water soluble additive such as urea may be added for adjustment purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Following this adjustment, the water phase is optically remeasured to determine whether its refractive index matches that of the oil phase. Thus, if the oil phase had a refractive index of 1.4100 and the initial refractive index of the water phase was 1.3980, additional non-glycol inclusions such as an inorganic salt are added to make its refractive index about 1.4100. In the compositions of the invention, the closer the match of the water and the oil phase, the more optically clear is the resulting emulsion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The above oil phase and water phase refractive indices are measured by using refractometers which are known in the art. An example of such a refractometer is a Reichert-Jung, Abbe Mark II Refractometer Model 10480. And the refractive index is measured at a suitable temperature, usually, at about 21&deg; C. which is room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The water phase is then added slowly to the oil phase, while the mixture is mixed at about 10,000 RPM or higher as needed to form a stable emulsion. A sonolator is the preferred method of shearing the product to form a gel with a viscosity of 50,000-200,000 cps. at about 21&deg; C. measured using a Brookfield Viscometer with a T-F bar &commat;10 rpm/30 seconds. Preferably the emulsion has a viscosity between about 50,000 cps to about 100,000 cps measured as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Within the oil phase there is a volatile silicone. The volatile silicone can range from about 1% to about 5%, more preferably between about 2% to about 4%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Within the oil phase there is a non-volatile silicone or a non-volatile ester. The non-volatile silicone or non-volatile ester can range from about 9% to about 25%, more preferably between about 15% to about 25%. The non-volatile silicone or non-volatile ester can serve as emollients in compositions of the invention. The emollient can range from about 0.5% to about 5%, more preferably between about 2% to about 4%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Compositions of the invention can be made by known processes or by processes which are analogous to known processes. What follows are specific compositions of the invention which are clear gels and which have been made. These examples are illustrative and are not meant to limit the present invention. </paragraph>
