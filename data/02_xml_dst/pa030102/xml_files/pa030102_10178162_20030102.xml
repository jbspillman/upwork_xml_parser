<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A connector for securing a protective sleeve about an electrical cable portion of an electrical cable assembly. The connector is formed of heat-shrinkable tubing and is slipped over the cuff of the sleeve and a portion of an adjacent plug of the cable assembly. Upon the application of sufficient heat to the connector, the connector shrinks around and onto the sleeve cuff and plug portion to form a relatively thin, smooth, mechanical attachment between the sleeve cuff and plug portion. The protective sleeve is thereby immovably disposed about the cable portion of the electrical cable assembly to minimize wear and tear to the cable portion during use in supplying temporary electrical power to planes at an airport. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a connector for securing a protection device to a cable, and in particular to a connector for immovably securing a protection device on an electrical cable assembly of the type used to supply ground power to aircraft at airports. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a relatively smooth connector that facilitates easy handling of the cable assembly, that does not significantly increase the diameter of the plug portion of the assembly, that forms a secure immovable disposition of the protection device about the cable portion of the assembly, and which is capable of withstanding the wear and tear encountered during normal use of the electrical cable assembly. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Electrical cables are commonly used to provide temporary electrical power to equipment such as airplanes when the plane cannot supply its own electrical power, such as when it is at rest on the ground at an airport gate. Such electrical cables must be dragged on the surface on which the plane is parked, typically concrete, from a stationary power source to the receptacle location on the plane where a plug at the end of the cable is electrically connected to the plane. As the cable is repeatedly dragged on the concrete, the insulation on the cable can be worn away, ultimately causing failure of the cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> These types of cables have been conventionally protected by wrapping them with some type of tape, or by sliding sections of plastic pipe over the cable. While these protective structures partially accomplish the objective of protecting the cable, each solution makes the cable difficult to handle and move, and does not thoroughly complete the task of protecting the cable from the degree of wear and tear it is exposed to in an airport application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A protective sleeve similar to the type used to protect jet aircraft starting hoses has also been utilized with success to protect aircraft electrical cables. One example of this type of protective sleeve suitable for use with the present invention is relatively lightweight and flexible due to its formation from a combination of materials, and is sold under the trademark LCD&trade; by Salem-Republic Rubber Company, the assignee of the present invention, and is proprietary technology. Such a protective sleeve slides easily, with little abrasion, across the concrete airport surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in order for such a protective sleeve to properly function, as has heretofore been the case with more conventional protection devices, a means must be provided to achieve a secure mechanical connection of the protective sleeve to the cable assembly. This secure connection is necessary to retain the protective sleeve in place about the cable portion of the assembly. If the sleeve is free to move along the length of the cable portion, such relocation may expose the cable to wear. Also, movement of the sleeve could cause it to bunch up, possibly leading to failure of the protective sleeve. Moreover, the means utilized to secure the sleeve in place on the cable assembly must not significantly increase the size of the plug, which could prevent the plug from fitting in a limited space in the plug receptacle on the plane. Finally, any such securing means must still enable the protective sleeve to be easily removed in the event that the cable assembly or sleeve requires repair. The use of common band clamps and the like to connect the protective sleeve to the cable assembly are undesirable because they can cause injury to a worker&apos;s hands which are placed at the juncture of the cable plug to the cable every time it is plugged into the aircraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention solves a long-felt need in the art of mechanically and securely connecting a protection device to an aircraft electrical cable to reduce or eliminate wear and tear on the cable, wherein the connector is easy to handle by a worker, and does not significantly increase the diameter of the already large cable plug which electrically connects the cable to a receptacle on the plane, since the space adjacent to the receptacle is limited. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Objectives of the present invention include providing a connector which mechanically and securely attaches a protection device to an aircraft electrical cable, to reduce wear and tear to the cable during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another objective of the present invention is to provide such a connector which is easily handled by a worker, and which does not substantially increase the diameter of the cable plug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A further objective of the present invention is to provide such a connector which is relatively inexpensive, durable, and easy to install and remove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These objectives and advantages are obtained by the electrical cable assembly including an electrical cable having at least a pair of ends and being electrically connected to a power source at one of the pair of ends and being electrically connected to a plug at the other of the pair of ends, the electrical cable being encased in a protective sleeve, wherein the improvement comprises, a heat-shrinkable member disposed about a portion of the protective sleeve adjacent to the plug and at least a portion of the plug, so that upon application of heat to the member, the member shrinks into contact with the sleeve and the plug to immovably secure the sleeve in place about the electrical cable.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An electrical cable assembly of the type well-known in the art and capable of carrying electrical power to equipment such as an airplane when the plane cannot supply its own electrical power, such as when the plane is at rest on the ground at an airport gate, is indicated generally at <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Electrical cable assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises an electrical cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> electrically connected to a selected one of the ends of the cable. The end of cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> opposite from plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a power source in a usual manner. Cable plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thus can be inserted into an electrical receptacle on a piece of equipment, such as an airplane (not shown), to provide temporary electrical power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For airport applications such as described immediately above, electrical cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fully encased in a protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is installed by sliding over cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> until the sleeve abuts plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A preferred protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for use with the connector of the present invention is relatively lightweight and flexible due to its formation from a combination of materials, and is sold under the trademark LCD&trade; by Salem-Republic Rubber Company of Sebring, Ohio. Protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, when properly secured on electrical cable assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, slides easily and with little abrasion across hard surfaces, including the concrete surface at an airport, and protects electrical cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from excessive wear and tear associated with being dragged across such hard surfaces during use. Protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is removable from electrical cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in case replacement or repair of electrical cable assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or the sleeve is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a connector for mechanically, securely and immovably mounting protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> about electrical cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is indicated at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. Connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> preferably is formed of a heat-shrinkable tubing of the type commonly used for the protection of electrical terminals or connectors where the shrinkable tubing also serves as an insulator. A preferred shrinkable tubing for forming connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the present invention is marketed by Raychem Corporation, Electrical Power Products, of Menlo Park, Calif. Although it is contemplated that other appropriate shrinkable tubing can be used to form connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the present invention, the interior surface of Raychem&trade; shrinkable tubing is precoated with an adhesive that, when heated, melts and flows to form a bond that seals out moisture and corrosion and follows the thermal expansion of electrical cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an important feature of the present invention, connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is slipped over the cuff of protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a portion of adjacent plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and heated. A hot air blow torch preferably is used to apply sufficient heat to connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, although it is contemplated that other appropriate heat sources could be used, such as a clean burning propane torch or a belt heater. The amount of heat applied to connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the duration for which it is applied, will depend upon the exact type and thickness of shrinkable tubing employed. However, the heat should be applied directly to connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at a temperature, and for a duration, that will cause connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to shrink, but not cause damage to protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The applied heat causes connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to shrink around the cuff of protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a portion of plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a relatively thin, smooth, and secure mechanical connection between the plug and the protective sleeve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one of the main features of the present invention, relatively smooth connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> enables a worker, who must place his/her hands at the point of juncture between plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> every time the cable is electrically connected to the plane, to efficiently and safely handle cable assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> without injuring his/her hands on bulky band clamps and the like. Moreover, relatively thin connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> does not significantly increase the diameter of plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is important since the available space for connecting the plug to the plane receptacle is limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Another feature and advantage of inventive connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is that the mechanical attachment between plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> retains the protective sleeve its place with respect to electrical cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the plug, and prevents the protective sleeve from bunching up on or sliding off of and exposing the electrical cable. If protective sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> were permitted to dislocate, excessive wear of electrical cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> could result, and if the protective sleeve bunched up it could fail. It is understood that connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be relatively easily removed from cable assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to enable replacement/repair of cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, or the connector itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the present invention could also be used for making mechanical connections on other types of cables, wires, cords, sleeves, and the like, including electrical cables having more than a pair of ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the connector of the present invention for securing a protective sleeve to an electrical cable is simplified, provides an effective, safe, inexpensive and reliable device which achieves all of the enumerated objectives, provides for eliminating difficulties encountered with prior connectors, and solves problems and obtains new results in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for brevity, clearness and understanding; but no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom beyond the requirements of the prior art, because such terms are used for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the description and illustration of the invention is by way of example, and the scope of the invention is not limited to the exact details shown or described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Having now described the features, discoveries and principles of the invention, the manner in which the connector is used to secure a protective sleeve on an electrical cable, the characteristics of the construction, arrangement and method steps, and the advantageous, new and useful results obtained; the new and useful structures, devices, elements, arrangements, process, parts and combinations are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
