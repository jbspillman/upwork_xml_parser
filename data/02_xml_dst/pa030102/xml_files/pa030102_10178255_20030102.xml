<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention lies in the fuel cell technology field and relates, more specifically, to a fuel cell installation with a device for rapid shutdown. In addition, the invention relates to a method for operating a fuel cell installation having such a shutdown device in a motor vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> German patent DE 196 30 842 C1 discloses a device for rapidly shutting down fuel cells, wherein a fuel cell are provided with a plurality of individual cells connected to one another via gas lines, and means for emergency shutting down the fuel cell when a fault occurs. In order to avoid a large amount of damage in the event of a fault, means are provided for interrupting the gas line connections, which means disconnect the individual fuel cells from one another in terms of gas equipment when an emergency shut down occurs. Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 5,193,635 discloses a vehicle with a fuel cell drive wherein the fuel cell stack is used as an energy carrier of the drive unit of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A disadvantage with the latter system in the motor vehicle is that in the event of the fuel cell installation approaching a critical point&mdash;whether in terms of the parameters &ldquo;temperature&rdquo;, &ldquo;pressure&rdquo;, etc. or other significant variables&mdash;there are no protection measures provided to allow for a risk of explosion which is presented bKy the fuel cell, in particular by the hydrogen supply of the hydrogen tank of the complete fuel cell installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Particular measures for protecting fuel cell installations which are used specifically in the mobile field are generally not provided. In this context, in view of the fact that in the event of a short circuit caused, for example, by a vehicle accident, the fuel cell installation continues to generate current which is not consumed, a protection measure which eliminates the risk of an electric shock is all but indispensable. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a fuel cell installation and an operating method, which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and provide suitable protection measures for a fuel cell installation and also specifies a suitable operating method for operating the unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a fuel cell installation and a device for rapid shutdown, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> a measuring and control unit having inputs for receiving sensor signals from the sensors and outputs for control lines for deactivating one or more lines selected from the group consisting of the fuel lines, the process gas lines, and electrical lines for effecting an emergency shut-down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In other words, the objects of the invention are achieved with a fuel cell installation of the type mentioned in the introductory text provided with a device for emergency shutdown. In addition, the subject matter of the invention is a method for operating a fuel cell installation in a vehicle with which it is possible to ensure that as soon as there is the risk that a critical operating state could be reached in the fuel cell installation and/or in the motor vehicle, the unit and/or the reformer are automatically shut down and disconnected from the fuel supply and/or the devices for conducting current and/or voltage are removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The device for emergency shutting down in the stack and/or in the end plates and/or in the housing of the stack preferably comprises a control and measuring device so that when specific operating states occur (temperature, pressure, voltage), the fuel supply and/or the electrical connections are automatically disconnected or isolated. This then also leads directly to switching off of the unit. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> a measuring and control unit having an input connected to receive an operative signal from the crash sensor and outputs for control lines for deactivating one or more lines selected from the group consisting of the fuel line, the process gas line, and the electrical line for effecting an emergency shut-down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a particular feature of the invention, the crash sensor is disposed in a fender of the motor vehicle. In a preferred system, the crash sensor is operatively connected to at least one airbag of the motor vehicle and/or to a seat belt in the motor vehicle (e.g., the driver&apos;s seat seatbelt). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with again an added feature of the invention, the sensor is one of a group of crash sensors distributed about the motor vehicle, and wherein additional sensors such as temperature sensors, pressure sensors, and/or voltage sensors are disposed in the motor vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In accordance with again an additional feature of the invention, the measuring and control unit includes a microcontroller for processing the measured values and for comparing the measured values with stored operating curves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With the above and other objects in view there is also provided, in accordance with the invention, a method for operating a fuel cell installation in a vehicle, which comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> monitoring operating states of one of the fuel cell installation and of the motor vehicle; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> if a critical operating state is reached, automatically shutting down the fuel cell installation by at least one of disconnecting the fuel cell installation from a fuel supply and deactivating all devices carrying electrical energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a concomitant feature of the invention, if the critical operating state is reached, all secondary lt assemblies, such as a reformer of the fuel cell installation are automatically shut down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a motor vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has, for example, an electric motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as drive and fuel cell installation <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for supplying the drive. The fuel cell installation can advantageously be what is referred to as a PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cell, in particular also an HT fuel cell, which operates in the range from 80 to 300&deg; C. at temperatures which are increased in comparison with the normal temperature. The PEM fuel cell is operated with hydrogen or hydrogen-rich gas that is acquired by reformation from alcohols, for example methanol, or else also acquired from gasoline, and oxygen, in particular atmospheric oxygen from the surroundings as an oxidant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> For the sake of completeness, an exhaust system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is shown wherein product water can be output when the unit is operated with pure hydrogen, or else other exhaust gases which are generated can be output when the unit is operated with hydrogen-rich gas. Furthermore, sensors <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&Prime; are present whose signals are transmitted to a control device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, on which further details are given below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The electrical connection from the fuel cell installation <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the electric motor is to be interrupted in the case of faults. The fuel cell installation <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has a device for emergency shutdown <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that, in the case of a risk due to short circuit and/or when a critical operating state is reached, all the devices for conducting current and/or voltage, such as the electrical lines, distributors, etc. are automatically disconnected from the vehicle and/or from the stack and/or the fuel supply is closed off. The device for emergency shutting down firstly provides at least for the fuel supply to be closed and in addition, when required, further measures such as disconnection and/or blowing of the devices for conducting current and/or voltage. The essential factor here is that both critical operating states of the fuel cells and critical states of the motor vehicle, for example due to an accident or the like, are taken into account and lead to the shutting off of the entire fuel cell installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the device for emergency shutting off in detail: a measuring and control device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, identified in the figure as a control unit, receives via inputs <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> the signals of a series of sensors. There are, on the one hand, sensors at least for the parameters of &ldquo;temperature T&rdquo;, &ldquo;pressure P&rdquo; and &ldquo;voltage U&rdquo;, and, on the other hand, also what are referred to as crash sensors. There is advantageously a multiplicity of groups of such sensors which are mounted at the specific locations in the unit. In particular, in the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the crash sensors may be arranged in the fenders or be coupled to the airbag or to the belt pretensioner of the seat belts. Such sensors are designated by <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&Prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, five of a total of n sensors are illustrated by way of example. Furthermore, the fuel cell installation <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is completed with a reformer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This means that the reformer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> processes a fuel to form hydrogen-rich gas which is a process gas of the fuel cell installation <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The other process gas, namely the oxidant, is acquired, for example, from the ambient air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> further illustrates exemplary valves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for the process gases and a valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the fuel. As soon as one of the sensors responds, the control device is activated and, if appropriate, control signals or actuating signals are activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The measuring and control device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is illustrated with a microcontroller or microprocessor &mgr;P and a memory MEM in which characteristic curves or operating curves are stored. In the device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, limiting values are acquired in accordance with the recorded signals that are advantageously compared with the stored characteristic curves in the computer-supported control unit. When the limiting values are reached the device for emergency shutdown is activated. This means that predefined values can be set in such a way that as soon as there is the risk that a critical operating state could be reached, the unit and/or the reformer are automatically shut down. Furthermore, the fuel supply to the reformer is also disconnected. Finally, all the devices for conducting current and/or voltage can also be deactivated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The fuel cell installation has been described above in the application in electrotraction, specifically in particular for use in motor vehicles. Corresponding principles also apply in other applications of fuel cell installations. </paragraph>
