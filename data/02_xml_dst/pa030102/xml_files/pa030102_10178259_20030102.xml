<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to calipers or caliper instruments (also sometimes referred to as dividers) of the type utilized by persons who work in dark environments, for example paramedics needing to make measurements on a medical chart plotted by a heart monitoring instrument under &ldquo;field conditions&rdquo;, navigators, aviators, and other persons who must measure the distance between two points of a chart plotted by an instrument, a map, or other document under very low ambient illumination conditions. It is important that the &ldquo;night vision&rdquo; of such persons not be temporarily disrupted by the presence of unnecessarily bright &ldquo;white&rdquo; light on the document (or other surface) to allow measurement of the distance between two points on the document. A person whose eyes are open for approximately 15 to 20 minutes under dark conditions or very low ambient illumination conditions acquires what is known as &ldquo;night vision&rdquo;, wherein the person&apos;s eyes become much more sensitive to low levels of ambient illumination. If the eyes of a person who has acquired night vision are suddenly subjected to relatively bright light, especially white light, the person is subjected to what is referred to as &ldquo;night blindness&rdquo;, wherein the acquired night vision is lost. The person then must reacquire his/her night vision by remaining in no-light or very low-light conditions for another 15 to 20 minutes, during which he or she may be unable to recognize critically important things or occurrences in the low ambient light conditions in which the person is working. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Although a need for solving this problem has existed for long time, no practical means for solving the problem, such as a compact, reasonably inexpensive illuminated caliper instrument, has been provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,115,571, issued May 26, 1992, by present inventor Robert A. Mackin, discloses a caliper instrument including a gear mechanism wherein the upper ends of the caliper legs are interlocked by gear teeth so that the caliper legs of the symmetrically in opposite directions about a bisection axis. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a caliper instrument which provides adequate illumination to a person working under night conditions for very low ambient illumination conditions for utilization of a caliper instrument to measure or delineate the distance between points on a document or object without impairing the night vision of the person measuring coordinating the distance between the points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Briefly described, and in accordance with one embodiment thereof, the invention provides a caliper instrument including a light emitting diode, a battery, and an on/off switch contained/installed in a hub of the illuminated caliper instrument from which its caliper legs extend. The light emitting diode is oriented to illuminate an area on the document including a pair of points the distance between which is to be measured or delineated the by needle points of the caliper instrument. In one described embodiment, two light emitting diodes, preferably red light emitting diodes or green light emitting diodes, are contained/installed in/on the hub of the caliper instrument. The optical axis of one of the light emitting diodes is oriented at a predetermined angle relative to a bisection axis of the optical instrument, and the optical axis of the other light emitting diode is oriented at an asymmetrically opposite angle relative to the bisection axis, so that points of the document touched by the needle points of the caliper instrument when its caliper legs are opened wide are equally and adequately illuminated. In one embodiment, the light emitting diodes are mounted directly on lower portions of the legs to direct the light precisely to areas of the document or object to be measured by the needle points. In another embodiment, fiber optic elements extend between each light emitting diode and a corresponding fiber optic lens attached to a lower portion of a corresponding leg. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, illuminated caliper instrument <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a hub <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from which a pair of caliper legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> downwardly extend. A pair of needles <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> extend downwardly from the lower ends of legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively. Legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are attached to a gear mechanism <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (see the bottom view shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) which can be essentially identical to that disclosed in the above referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,115,571, so that when the caliper legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are &ldquo;opened&rdquo; or &ldquo;closed&rdquo; as indicated by arc <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the movement of each leg <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is symmetrically opposite with reference to a bisection axis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. (Alternatively, the upper ends of legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be pivotally attached to hub <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> without use of gear mechanism <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Hub <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes the above-mentioned gear mechanism <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which is includes two engaged gears attached to the upper ends of caliper legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which are pivotally connected to a gear housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, within gear housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An annular cap retaining ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rigidly attached to and disposed around the periphery of the upper portion of gear housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The plane of retaining ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is perpendicular to bisection axis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. An O ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed in a groove (not shown), the plane of which is parallel to the plane of cap retaining ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Hub <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a cylindrical battery housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> into which a switch mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having outer threads <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is threaded. Switch mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a suitable switch control element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which can be a rotary device or a depressible switch button or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are in a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; configuration, i.e., have been moved close to each other so that both are parallel to bisection axis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, then a protective cylindrical cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be slid over O ring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and abutted against the lower edge of annular cap retaining ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A suitable pocket clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be attached to the lower end of protective cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, wherein reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A designates the illuminated caliper instrument <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with protective cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in place. If desired, pocket clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can instead be provided at the upper end of protective cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as indicated by dotted lines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, a first light emitting diode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a second light emitting diode <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are powered by the battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) retained in battery housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> when switch mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is actuated or turned on. Battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be a suitable, readily available hearing aid type of battery or button-type battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> First light emitting diode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is installed at the bottom portion of gear housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> adjacent to the left side of legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, so that the optical axis of light emitting diode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is generally oriented in a direction indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, so as to adequately illuminate a portion of a document or other surface (not shown) to be contacted by the tip of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are spread fairly far apart. Similarly, second light emitting diode <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is installed on the right side of legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, so that the optical axis of light emitting diode <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is generally oriented in a direction indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, so as to adequately illuminate a portion of the document or surface to be contacted by the tip of needle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> when legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are spread fairly far apart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be, for example, red light emitting diodes or green light emitting diodes of recent high-intensity design. In recent years, low-power light emitting diodes of sufficiently high intensity to illuminate a document for reading purposes have become available. Such light emitting diodes are available in both red and green colors, which are less likely to interfere with the night vision of a person such as a paramedic, navigator, aviator astronomer, or the like who is working in darkness or in low ambient light conditions and is depending on his/her &ldquo;night vision&rdquo; to accomplish his/her work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when such person turns on light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of illuminated caliper instrument <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to measure the distance between two points on the document, the intensity of the illumination produced on the document by light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> does not appreciably interfere with the person&apos;s night vision because the light is directed to the document or surface rather than to the person&apos;s eyes. The significantly reduces the chance of the person undergoing night blindness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the switch mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has peripheral threads <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed on its lower portion. The external threads <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> mate with internal threads <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of battery housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so switch assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be threaded into battery housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> when battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is in place within battery housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the schematic diagram of the light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, switch assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> referred to above. Battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> actually is composed of several button type batteries stacked in series. The (&plus;) terminal of battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected to one terminal of switch assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the other terminal of which is connected to the anodes of light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The cathodes of light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are connected to the negative terminal of battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. (Alternatively, light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> could be connected in series.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are attached directly to upper portions of caliper legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively, so that the optical axes of the two light emitting diodes change direction along with the longitudinal axes caliper legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively, as they are moved in the directions indicated by arc <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are attached directly to lower ends of caliper legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively, so that the optical axes of the two light emitting diodes change direction along with the longitudinal axes of caliper legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively, as they are moved in the directions indicated by arc <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The shorter distances between the between the light emitting diodes and the document or object to be measured results in increased illumination thereof. In this case, two pairs of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extending along caliber legs and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively, couple light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, respectively, to switch mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and battery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In another alternative embodiment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, two pairs of fiber optic bundles <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extend along caliper legs <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively, to couple light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to fiber optic lenses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which are respectively attached to the lower ends of caliper legs <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This arrangement directs the light precisely and with increased intensity to smaller areas of the document or object to be contacted and/or measured by the tips of the needles <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to several particular embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will be able to make the various modifications to the described embodiments of the invention without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all elements or steps which are insubstantially different or perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same result as what is claimed are within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For example, in some cases a single light emitting diode could be provided, for example, between caliper legs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, to illuminate the area of the document or surface to be measured. </paragraph>
