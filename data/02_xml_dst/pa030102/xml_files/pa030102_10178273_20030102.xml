<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An object of the present invention is to enhance a converging property of an electron beam in an electron-emitting device in which a cathode electrode, an insulating layer, and a gate electrode are laminated and a through hole is formed by partially removing the gate electrode so as to obtain an exposed portion of the cathode electrode. In such an,electron-emitting device in which the cathode electrode, the insulating layer, and the gate electrode are laminated and the through hole is formed by partially removing the gate electrode so as to obtain the exposed portion of the cathode electrode, only a central region of the electron-emitting layer on the cathode electrode is connected to the cathode electrode. With this structure, it becomes possible to generate an electron beam only from the central region of the electron-emitting layer connected to the cathode electrode and to realize an electron-emitting device having a small beam diameter and a high-definition image-forming apparatus. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electron-emitting device that performs electron emission through the application of a voltage, an electron source, and an image-forming apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Electron-emitting devices heretofore known are generally grouped into two types: a thermionic cathode type and a cold-cathode type. Cold-cathode electron-emitting devices include field-emission (hereafter referred to as FE-type) devices, metal-insulator-metal (hereafter referred to as MIM-type) devices, and surface conduction electron-emitting devices, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, an FE-type device, such as the one disclosed by W. P. Dyke and W. W. Dolan in &ldquo;Field Emission&rdquo;, Advance in Electron Physics, 8, 89 (1956), or the one disclosed by C. A. Spindt in &ldquo;PHYSICAL Properties of thin-film field emission cathodes with molybdenum cones&rdquo;, J. Appl. Phys., 47, 5248 (1976), is known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An MIM-type device, such as the one disclosed by C. A. Mead in &ldquo;Operation of Tunnel-Emission Devices&rdquo;, J. Apply. Phys., 32,646 (1961), is known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also, examples of devices which have been recently studied are as follows: Toshiaki, Kusunoki, &ldquo;Fluctuation-free electron emission from non-formed metal-insulator-metal (MIM) cathodes fabricated by low current Anodic oxidation&rdquo;, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. vol. 32 (1993) pp. L1695, and Mutsumi Suzuki et al., &ldquo;An MIM-Cathode Array for Cathode luminescent Displays&rdquo;, IDW&apos;96, (1996) pp. 529. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An example of the surface conduction electron-emitting device is reported by M. I. Elinson in Radio Eng. Electron Phys., 10, (1965). The surface conduction electron-emitting device uses a phenomenon where electrons are emitted when an electric current is allowed to flow in parallel to the surface of a thin film that has a small area and is formed on a substrate. While Elinson proposes the use of an SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>thin film for the surface conduction device, the use of an Au thin film (G. Dittmer, Thin Solid Films, 9, 317 (1972)) and the use of an In<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>thin film (M. Hartwell and C. G. Fonstad, IEEE Trans. ED Conf., 519 (1983)) are also proposed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> By the way, in an image display apparatus, electrons emitted from an electron-emitting device collide against a phosphor (anode electrode) arranged so as to oppose the electron-emitting device, thereby having the phosphor emit light. However, in a high-definition image-forming apparatus, the electron-emitting device is asked for convergence of the emitted electron beam trajectory, miniaturization of the size, simplification of the producing method and reduction of the driving voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As to the FE type electron-emitting device, there is widely known a Spindt type electron-emitting device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. The tip of its electron-emitting region has a sharp-pointed structure, so that it is difficult to converge an electron beam and it is also difficult to realize a high-definition image-forming apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> There is also proposed a device structure where a focusing electrode for converging an electron beam is provided in the Spindt type electron-emitting device, although there occur various problems. For instance, the device structure and manufacturing method are complicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In contrast to this, for instance, JP08-96704 A proposes an electron-emitting device having the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> where an approximately flat electron-emitting layer is formed within an opening portion of a gate electrode and an insulating layer. With this structure, there is suppressed the widening of an electron beam. However, the electrons emitted from the end regions of the electron-emitting layer greatly spread out along an electric field formed by the gate electrode and a cathode electrode as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, in an example disclosed in JP 08-115654 A, there is proposed a structure where in order to converge an electron beam, a part of a cathode electrode is concaved and an electron-emitting layer is arranged in the concaved region. In the case of this structure, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, if the electron-emitting layer adheres to the side walls of the concaved region or a region other than the concaved region, for instance, there is not obtained an effect of converging an electron beam. Consequently, there is required a technique with which it is possible to perform an alignment operation with a high degree of precision during the manufacturing of the device. This causes a problem concerning the uniformity of devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In order to attain the above-mentioned object, the present invention relates to an electron-emitting device in which: a cathode electrode and agate electrode are arranged on a substrate; an electron is transported from the cathode electrode to an electron-emitting layer arranged on the cathode electrode; and the electron is emitted into a vacuum from the electron-emitting layer, the device being characterized in that a portion of the electron-emitting layer is connected to the cathode electrode through an electron blocking layer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Also, it is preferable that the region, in which the electron-emitting layer contacts the cathode electrode, exists closer to a central portion within a region of the electron-emitting layer than the region in which the electron-emitting layer contacts the electron blocking layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that if an energy difference between the cathode electrode and a conduction band of the electron blocking layer within the region, in which the electron-emitting layer contacts the electron blocking layer, is referred to as El and an energy difference between the cathode electrode and the conduction band of the electron-emitting layer within the region, in which the electron-emitting layer contacts the cathode electrode, is referred to as E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the following relation exists between E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt;E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Also, it is preferable that an upper end surface of the cathode electrode contacting the electron-emitting layer exists at a position that is closer to the substrate side than an upper end surface of the cathode electrode contacting the electron blocking layer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also, it is preferable that the electron-emitting layer has a band gap whose numerical value is positive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Also, it is preferable that the electron-emitting layer is one of a diamond like carbon film and an amorphous carbon film. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Also, an electron source according to the present invention is characterized in that a plurality of electron-emitting devices are arranged therein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The electron-emitting device according to this embodiment mainly includes a cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> arranged on a substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an insulating layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an electron-emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (layer including an electron-emitting material) arranged on the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an electron blocking layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is partially arranged between the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the electron-emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and an anode electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> arranged so as to oppose these construction elements as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> An example method of manufacturing the electron-emitting device of the present invention will be described below. Firstly, the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided. The substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can use one of quartz glass, glass in which the amount of impurities like Na is reduced, soda lime glass, a lamination member configured by laminating SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film on a silicon substrate, or the like. An insulating substrate such as ceramics and alumina can also be used as the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is laminated on the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In general, the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has conductivity and is formed by a general technique, such as an vacuum deposition method or a sputtering method, or a photolithography technique. The material of the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is, for instance, appropriately selected from a group consisting of metals (such as Be, Mg, Ti, zr, Hf. V, Nb, Mo, W, Al, Cu, Ni, Cr, Au, Pt, and Pd) or their alloys, carbides (such as TiC, ZrC, HfC, TaC, SiC, and WC), borides (such as HfB<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, ZrB<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LaB<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, CeB<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, YB<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and GdB<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), nitrides (such as TiN, ZrN, and HfN), semiconductors (such as Si and Ge) carbon, and the like </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set in a range of from several ten nm to several hundred &mgr;m, and preferably in a range of from several hundred nm to several &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Next, the electron blocking layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is deposited on the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This electron blocking layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed with a general method such as a sputtering method, a thermal oxidization method, an anodization method, or the like. The thickness of the electron blocking layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is set in a range of from several nm to several &mgr;m, and preferably in a range of from several ten nm to several hundred nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Further, the insulating layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is deposited on the electron blocking layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This insulating layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed by a general method such as a sputtering method, a thermal oxidization method, an anodization method, or the like. The thickness of the insulating layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is set in a range of from several nm to several &mgr;m, and preferably in a range of from several ten nm to several hundred nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Next, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is deposited on the insulating layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Then a lamination member(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is provided as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. Like the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has conductivity and is formed by a general technique, such as an evaporation method or a sputtering method, or a photolithography technique. The material of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is, for instance, appropriately selected from a group consisting of metals (such as Be, Mg, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Mo, W, Al, Cu, Ni, Cr, Au, Pt, and Pd) or their alloys, carbides (such as TiC, ZrC, HfC, TaC, SiC, and WC), borides (such as HfB<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, ZrB<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LaB<highlight><subscript>6:, </subscript></highlight>CeB<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, YB<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and GdB<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), nitrides (such as TiN, ZrN, and HfN), semiconductors (such as Si and Ge), carbon, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is set in a range of from several ten nm to several &mgr;m, and preferably in a range of from several ten nm to several hundred nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, with a photolithography technique, the electron blocking layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the insulating layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are partially removed from the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in an etching step. In this manner, an opening region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed so that the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is exposed. Note that it does not matter whether this etching step is terminated before the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also etched or is continued until the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is partially etched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The opening region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> formed in this step has a hole shape, a slit shape, or the like. There is selected an appropriate shape in accordance with a required beam shape, driving voltage, and the like. The size of the opening region is selected from an optimum range in accordance with a required beam size, driving voltage, and the like and is set in a range of from several nm to several ten &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Next, an etching step for further removing the side walls of the insulating layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is performed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>. In this step, for instance, there may be performed an etching operation that uses a solution such as a hydrofluoric acid solution. Aside from this, there may be selected a condition under which isotropic etching is performed using plasma. Also, in the step of establishing an opening in the gate electrode, by optimally setting an etching condition, it becomes possible to omit the step of etching the side walls of the insulating layer during the aforementioned step of establishing an opening in the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Finally, the electron-emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is deposited within the opening region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference>. During this operation, it does not matter whether a material for forming the electron-emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> exists only within the opening region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or also coats the gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> Also, the present invention is not limited to the form described above that has an opening region. That is, the present invention is preferably applicable to a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> where the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is arranged over the gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the insulating layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Here, in the case where a high-definition electron-emitting device is realized, it is required to use a device structure where it is possible to control an electron beam and to converge the beam. However, in an electron-emitting device produced with a conventional technique, when a voltage is applied to the device for driving so that electrons are emitted from the electron-emitting device, some of the electrons travel along an electric field formed in the vicinity of an electron-emitting region. As a result, it is difficult to converge an electron beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The present invention solves the problem described above and realizes a high-definition electron-emitting device. As to the electron-emitting device of the present invention, its mechanism for emitting electrons will be described in detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show a state where electrons are transported in the case where the electron-emitting device of the present invention is actually driven, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a state where electrons are emitted into a vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a region, in which electrons are emitted, and a region, in which no electron is emitted, of the electron-emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the electron-emitting device of the present invention. Also, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows schematic diagrams that illustrate a process of transporting electrons from the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the electron-emitting layer using an energy band diagram and are the equivalent of cross-sectional views taken along the lines A-A&prime; and B-B&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the electron-emitting device of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, in the region in which electrons are emitted, electrons are injected from the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the electron-emitting layer. consequently, the electrons are discharged into a vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the region in which there is inserted the electron blocking layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and no electron is emitted, before electrons are transported from the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the electron-emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, there exists a large energy barrier in comparison with the electron-emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and therefore the injection of electrons from the cathode electrode into the electron-emitting layer is inhibited by this barrier. As a result, it becomes possible to form a region in which electron emission does not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to effectively prevent a situation where electrons are emitted from the electron-emitting layer arranged on the electron blocking layer, in the electron-emitting film of the present invention, it is required that no free electron exists in a conduction band of the electron-emitting layer (there exists no electron other than the electrons injected from the cathode electrode) at room temperature. That is, the electron-emitting film of the present invention is at least constructed of a non-metallic substance. As a result, it is preferable that the electron-emitting film of the present invention has an energy gap that is at least equal to 0.3 eV between the Fermi level and the conduction band. This is because if the energy gap is smaller than this value, free electrons easily exist in the conduction band at room temperature (300K). By using an electron-emitting film having a structure like this, it becomes possible to effectively suppress electron emission from the electron-emitting film existing on the electron blocking layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As to the electron-emitting device of the present invention, because of the electron-emitting mechanism described above, the material of the electron-emitting layer described above is selected from materials having a positive energy band gap. As concrete examples of the materials of the electron-emitting film, there may be cited Si, SiC, and the like. However, it is preferable that there is used diamond, diamond like carbon, amorphous carbon, or the like that are known as low electric field electron-emitting materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Also, as to the electron-emitting film of the present invention, aside from the structure described above, there may be used a structure where the electrons injected from a region, which directly contacts the cathode electrode, to the electron-emitting layer do not move to the electron-emitting film on the electron blocking layer or, even it the electrons move, the electrons are not effectively emitted from the electron-emitting film on the electron blocking layer. The present invention is not limited to the materials described above and it is possible use other materials so long as a structure like this is used. In more detail, it is sufficient that the amount of electrons emitted from the electron-emitting film arranged on the electron blocking layer is suppressed so as to become 10% or less of the amount of electrons emitted from the region that directly contacts the cathode electrode. To do so, in more detail, it is sufficient that the resistance of the electron-emitting film is set at 10 &OHgr;&middot;cm or higher. Alternatively, it is also sufficient that high resistance effectively exists in a boundary region between a partial region of the electron-emitting film, which directly contacts the cathode electrode, and a region of the electron-emitting film that exists on the electron blocking layer. In more detail, it is sufficient that the resistance of the boundary region is at least equal to 10<highlight><superscript>2 &OHgr;&middot;</superscript></highlight>cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> By using the electron-emitting film described above, if the electron-emitting device of the present invention is actually driven in a manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it becomes possible to prevent electron discharge in a region, in which the electron blocking layer is formed, and to realize the convergence of an electron beam. In particular, a region in the vicinity of a region, in which the electron blocking layer described above is formed, is a region in which an electric field is greatly changed due to the device structure and the prevention of electron emission is effective at converging an electron beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Also, the electron blocking layer of the electron-emitting device of the present invention is a layer for effectively preventing the injection of electrons from the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the electron-emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the material of the electron blocking layer is selected so that the energy barrier formed at an interface between the cathode electrode and the electron blocking layer becomes larger than an energy barrier formed at an interface between the cathode electrode and the electron-emitting layer. For instance, the material is selected from a group consisting of insulating materials, such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and SiNx, and semiconductor materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the electron-emitting device of the present invention makes it possible to realize the convergence of an electron beam in comparison with a conventional electron-emitting device in which no electron blocking layer exists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the electron-emitting device of the present invention, the convergence of an electron beam is realized by inserting the electron blocking layer between the cathode electrode and the electron-emitting layer. As a result, for instance, there may be used a structure where a part of the surface of the cathode electrode is formed using an insulating layer as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there may be used a structure where the side walls of the insulating layer within the opening region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are not removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, by obtaining a structure where the surface of the cathode electrode within the opening region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>is concaved, it becomes possible to control the distribution of an electric field within the opening region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. As a result, it becomes possible to obtain a device structure that further converges an electron beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in the case where the insulating layer is removed in an inclined manner, for instance, there is obtained a structure where the electron-emitting layer partially overlaps the insulating layer. With this structure, it becomes possible to use the insulating layer as the electron blocking layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the structure examples of the electron-emitting layer device that have been described above, there may be used a structure where the surface of the gate electrode is coated with a material that is the same as the material of the electron-emitting layer, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In this case, it becomes possible to use the coat as a protective layer of the gate electrode or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, there may be used a structure where only an exposed region of the surface of the cathode electrode within the opening region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> described above is selectively oxidized, the oxidized layer is partially removed, and then the electron-emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Further, in the present invention, a material having a sharp-pointed tip or carbon fibers may be used as the electron emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. As the carbon fibers, there are preferably used carbon nanotubes (fibers that each have a cylindrical graphene that surrounds the axis of a fiber (single-wall carbon nanotubes)), and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (fibers that each have a plurality of cylindrical graphenes that surround the axis of a fiber), or graphitic nanofibers (fibers having graphemes stacked not-parallel to the axial direction of the fibers) Among these carbon fibers, it is particularly preferable that the graphitic nanofibers are used because it becomes possible to obtain large emission currents. Also, the carbon fibers described above include carbon nanocoils whose carbon fibers have a coil shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In that case, for instance, firstly a catalytic particles are disposed on the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Then, the above-mentioned carbon fibers grows from a catalyst particle by CVD method. Consequently, the electron-emitting layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> including the carbon fibers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be disposed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next, there will be described an example where the electron-emitting device is applied to an image-forming apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of a state where a plurality of electron-emitting devices of the present invention are arranged in a matrix manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Also, an image-forming apparatus obtained by arranging a plurality of electron-emitting devices, to which the present invention is applicable, will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight> denotes an electron source substrate, numeral <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> X-directional wiring, and numeral <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight> Y-directional wiring. Also, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> denotes an electron-emitting device of the present invention and numeral <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight> represents connection wiring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the X-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> includes m lines (DX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, DX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , DXm) and is formed using an aluminum-based wiring material obtained with an evaporation method to have a thickness of around 1 &mgr;m and width of 300 &mgr;m. The material, thickness, and width of the wiring are determined as appropriate. The Y-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight> includes n lines (DY<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, DY<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , DYn) and is formed in the same manner as the X-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> to have a thickness of 0.5 &mgr;m and a width of 100 &mgr;m. An unillustrated interlayer insulating layer having a thickness of around 1 &mgr;m is provided between the X-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> including the m lines and the Y-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight> including the n lines so as to electrically separate these wirings (m and n are each a positive integer) The unillustrated interlayer insulating layer is an insulating layer formed with a sputtering method or the like. For instance, the interlayer insulating layer having a desired shape is formed to cover the entire or a part of the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight> on which the X-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> has been formed. In particular, the thickness, material, and production method of the interlayer insulating layer are determined as appropriate so that the interlayer insulating layer is resistant to potential differences at intersections of the X-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> and the Y-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight>. The X-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> and the Y-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight> are respectively routed to the outside as external terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Each electrode (not shown) constituting the electron-emitting device <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> of the present invention is electrically connected to each of the m lines of the X-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> and then lines of the Y-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight> by connection wiring (not shown) formed using a conductive metal or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> To the X-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, there is connected an unillustrated scanning signal applying means for applying a scanning signal to select a row of the electron-emitting devices <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> of the present invention arranged in an X direction. On the other hand, to the Y-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight>, there is connected an unillustrated modulation signal generating means for modulating each column of the electron-emitting devices <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> of the present invention arranged in the Y direction in accordance with an input signal. The driving voltage applied to each electron-emitting device is supplied as a differential voltage between the scanning signal and modulation signal applied to the device. In the present invention, connection is carried out so that the Y-directional wiring has a high potential and the X-directional wiring has a low potential. By performing connection in this manner, there is obtained an effect of converging a beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned structure makes it possible to select respective electron-emitting devices and independently drive the selected devices using passive matrix wiring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> It is possible to form an image-forming apparatus whose display panel is constructed using an electron source having a passive matrix arrangement like this. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> It should be noted here that in an image-forming apparatus that uses the electron-emitting devices of the present invention, phosphors are aligned and arranged above the devices by giving consideration to the trajectory of emitted electrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</cross-reference> are each a schematic diagram showing a phosphor film used in this panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In the case of a color phosphor film, the phosphor film is constructed of a black conductive material <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and a phosphor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The black conductive material <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is called a black stripe when the phosphor is arranged in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A, and is called a black matrix when the phosphor is arranged in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The black stripe or the black matrix is provided to blacken the boundaries among respective phosphors <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> for the three primary colors required to display a color image, thereby preventing the striking of color mixture or the like and suppressing the lowering of contrast due to the reflection of external light by the phosphor film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As the material of the black strip, in this embodiment, there is used a material whose main ingredient is black lead that is usually used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, in usual cases, a metal back <highlight><bold>1125</bold></highlight> is provided on the internal surface side of the phosphor film <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The metal back is formed by subjecting the inner surface of the phosphor film to a smoothing process (usually called &ldquo;filming&rdquo;) after the phosphor film has been formed, and then by depositing Al using a vacuum evaporation method or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The face plate <highlight><bold>1126</bold></highlight> may be provided with a transparent electrode (not shown) on the outer surface side of the phosphor film <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight> to further enhance the conductivity of the phosphor film <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the case of color display, during the seal bonding of the panel, it is required to have phosphors in respective colors correspond to electron-emitting devices, which means that sufficient positional registration is indispensable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, corresponding phosphors are arranged immediately above an electron source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> A scanning circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> will be described below. This circuit includes therein M switching devices (schematically shown in the drawing using reference symbols S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Sm) Each of the switching devices selects one of an output voltage from a DC voltage source Vx and <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> &lsqb;V&rsqb; (ground level) and is electrically connected to one of the terminals Dx<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dxm of a display panel <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>. Each of the switching devices S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Sm operates based on a control signal Tscan outputted from a control circuit <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight>. For instance, the switching devices can be constructed by combining switching devices such as FETs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In this example, the DC voltage source Vx is set based on a characteristic (electron-emitting threshold voltage) of the electron-emitting device of the present invention so that there is outputted a constant voltage with which a driving voltage not exceeding the electron-emitting threshold voltage is applied to each device that is not scanned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The control circuit <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> has a function of establishing matching between operations of respective portions so that an appropriate display operation is performed based on an image signal inputted from the outside. On the basis of a synchronizing signal Tsync sent from a synchronizing-signal separation circuit <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>, the control circuit <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> generates respective control signals Tscan, Tsft, and Tmry and supplies these control signals to respective portions, The synchronizing-signal separation circuit <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight> is a circuit for separating an NTSC television signal inputted from the outside into a synchronizing signal component and a luminance signal component. It is possible to construct this circuit using a general frequency separation (filter) circuit or the like. The synchronizing signal separated by the synchronizing-signal separation circuit <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight> consists of a vertical synchronizing signal and a horizontal synchronizing signal. To simplify the description, however, the synchronizing signal is illustrated as a Tsync signal in the drawing. Also, the luminance signal component of an image separated from the television signal is expressed as a DATA signal for ease of explanation. The DATA signal is inputted into a shift register <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The shift register <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> serial/parallel-converts the DATA signal serially inputted in a time series manner for each line of an image, and operates based on the control signal Tsft sent from the control circuit <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> (that is, the control signal Tsft may be regarded as a shift clock signal for the shift register <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>). Data for one line of the image (corresponding to data for driving N electron-emitting devices), which has been serial/parallel converted, is outputted from the shift register <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> as N parallel signals Id<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Idn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> A line memory <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight> is a storage device for storing, for a required time, data for one line of the image. The line memory <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight> stores contents of Id<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Idn in accordance with the control signal Tmry sent from the control circuit <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> as appropriate. The stored contents are outputted as Id&prime;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Id&prime;n and are inputted into a modulation signal generator <highlight><bold>1307</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The modulation signal generator <highlight><bold>1307</bold></highlight> is a signal source for appropriately driving and modulating each electron-emitting device of the present invention in accordance with each of image data Id&prime;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Id&prime;n. An output signal from the modulation signal generator <highlight><bold>1307</bold></highlight> is applied, through the terminals Dox<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Doyn, to the electron-emitting devices of the present invention in the display panel <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As described above, the electron-emitting devices, to which the present invention is applicable, have the following basic characteristic with reference to an emission current Ie. That is, there exists a clear threshold voltage Vth for electron emission and, only when a voltage that is at least equal to Vth is applied, there occurs electron emission. As to the voltage that is at least equal to the electron-emitting threshold value, an emission current also changes in accordance with changes of a voltage applied to the devices. From this, in the case where a pulse-shaped voltage is applied to these devices, even if there is applied a voltage that does not exceed the electron-emitting threshold value, for instance, no electron is emitted. However, in the case where a voltage that is at least equal to the electron-emitting threshold value is applied, an electron beam is outputted. By changing a peak value Vm of the pulse during this operation, it becomes possible to control the intensity of the electron beam to be outputted. Also, by changing the width Pw of the pulse, it becomes possible to control the total quantity of electric charges of the electron beam to be outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the electron-emitting device can be modulated in accordance with an input signal using a voltage modulation method, a pulse-width modulation method, or the like. In the case where the voltage modulation method is employed, the modulation signal generator <highlight><bold>1347</bold></highlight> may be a voltage modulation circuit that generates a voltage pulse having a constant length and appropriately modulates the peak value of the pulse in accordance with the inputted data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the case where the pulse-width modulation method is employed, the modulation signal generator <highlight><bold>1307</bold></highlight> may be a pulse-width modulation circuit that generates a voltage pulse having a constant peak value and appropriately modulates the width of the voltage pulse in accordance with the inputted data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The shift register and line memory may be of a digital signal type or an analog signal type so long as it is possible to perform the serial/parallel conversion and storage of an image signal at a predetermined speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In the case where the digital signal type components are employed, the output signal DATA from the synchronizing-signal separation circuit <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight> must be converted into a digital signal. It is possible to perform this conversion by providing an A/D converter for the output portion of the synchronizing-signal separation circuit <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>. In relation to this, the circuit to be used as the modulation signal generator <highlight><bold>1307</bold></highlight> is somewhat changed depending on whether the output signal from the line memory <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight> is a digital signal or an analog signal. That is, in the case of the voltage modulation method using a digital signal, D/A conversion circuit or the like is used for the modulation signal generator <highlight><bold>1307</bold></highlight>, and an amplifying circuit and the like are added as necessary. In the case of the pulse-width modulation method, the modulation signal generator <highlight><bold>1307</bold></highlight> is constructed using a circuit formed by combining, for instance, a high-speed oscillator, a counter for counting the number of waves outputted from the oscillator, and a comparator for comparing an output value from the counter and an output value from the aforementioned memory. As the need arises, an amplifier may be added which amplifies the voltage of the modulation signal, which has been outputted from the comparator and whose pulse width has been modulated, to a voltage for driving the electron-emitting device of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In the case of the voltage modulation method using an analog signal, an amplifying circuit including an operational amplifier or the like may be employed as the modulation signal generator <highlight><bold>1307</bold></highlight>. As the need arises, a level shift circuit or the like may be added. In the case of the pulse-width modulation method, a voltage control oscillation circuit (VCO) may be employed, for instance. As the need arises, an amplifier may be added which amplifies the voltage to the voltage for driving the electron-emitting device of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The structure of the image-forming apparatus described above is merely an example of the image-forming apparatus to which the present invention is applicable. Therefore, various modifications may be made based on the technical idea of the present invention. Although the NTSC input signal has been described, the input signal is not limited to this signal. Another method, such as PAL or SECAM, may be employed. Also, another television signal method using a larger number of scanning lines (for instance, a high-quality television method typified by the MUSE method) may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Also, aside from the display apparatus, for instance, the image-forming apparatus of the present invention may be used as an image-forming apparatus functioning as an optical printer constructed using a photosensitive drum and the like. </paragraph>
