<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a suspension module for use with an independent suspension preferably including a pair of pivotal semi-trailing arms each having an airbag support which supports an airbag positioned between the semi-trailing arms and a subframe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Heavy vehicles, such as trucks, typically utilize a suspension system to provide a smooth and comfortable ride. A suspension system commonly includes a pair of parallel suspension arms which are pivotally attached to generally parallel frame rails of the vehicle chassis. An airbag is attached to the frame rail to compensate for various wheel load conditions. The suspension system translates road forces imparted to the wheels into rotational movement of the suspension arms relative to the frame rail. The rotational movement of the suspension arm is cushioned by the airbags. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In one prior art commercial vehicle system, the airbags are mounted to a transverse beam extending across the ends of the suspension arms and supported on the frame rails. This prior art system is not an independent suspension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In another prior art independent suspension system, the airbags are mounted to the suspension arms over the axle centerline and directly attached to the frame rails of the vehicle chassis. This positioning of the airbags over the axle centerline in an independent suspension makes the fitting of the suspension system under the frame rail of the vehicle chassis difficult. This problem increases when double tires are employed and as vehicle weight increases, requiring larger airbags. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Finally, coil spring positioned over the axle centerline and attached directly to the frame have been employed in passenger vehicles. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A suspension module for use in an independent suspension system is secured to the frame of a vehicle chassis and includes a subframe having a pair of spaced apart generally parallel subframe rails and a bridge supported therebetween. The suspension module further includes a pair of independently moveable suspension semi-trailing arms which are pivotally attached to the subframe rails. A spindle is bolted on each of the semi-trailing arms to receive a wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Each of the semi-trailing arms further include an airbag support onto which an airbag is mounted. The airbags provide vertical load support and are positioned between the airbag supports and the subframe rails. A shock absorber extending from each the semi-trailing arms to the subframe rails dampens movement. Preferably, the shock absorbers are positioned directly over the axle centerline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A drive line transmits rotational drive from a transmission to a carrier housing attached to the bridge of the subframe by a carrier by visco-elastic mounts. The carrier housing can be detached from the bridge, allowing the carrier housing to be rotated 180&deg; between a rear engine configuration and a front engine configuration. A carden shaft extending from the carrier housing to each of the spindles transmits rotational drive from the carrier housing to the spindles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These and other features of the present invention will be best understood from the following specification and drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a perspective view of the suspension module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The suspension module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is employed in an independent suspension system of a heavy vehicle, such as a commercial truck, to improve design and flexibility. The suspension module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a subframe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a pair of spaced apart generally parallel subframe rails <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> each including a first end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and an opposing second end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A bridge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends between the subframe rails <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The subframe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> defines a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which extends along the longitudinal length of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The subframe rails <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are secured to the frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of a vehicle chassis by an attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, such as bolts, welding, or the like. The vehicle frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provides the primary structural support of the body of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the suspension module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further includes a pair of independently moveable semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A first end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is pivotally attached to the hanger brackets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the subframe rails <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are independently pivotal relative to the subframe rails <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> about pivot axis <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. An angle &agr;(as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is defined between the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the vehicle frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The angle &agr; is preferably greater than 65&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A hub assembly <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extends from each of the semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The hub assemblies <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> each include a spindle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> bolted on a knuckle which provides an axle centerline <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Each spindle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> receives a wheel (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A second end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of each of the semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> includes an airbag support <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> onto which an airbag <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is mounted. Preferably, the airbags <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are located on the side of the axle centerline <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> opposite to the first end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are positioned between the airbag supports <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the second end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the subframe rails <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The airbags <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are attached to the subframe rails <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by airbag brackets <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which are attached to the subframe rails <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by fasteners <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> such as bolts, welding, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The airbags <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> provide vertical load support to the independent suspension system and damped the force during movement of the semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The airbags <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are preferably adjustable based on vehicle load conditions in a known manner. Although airbags <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> have been disclosed, it is to be understood that the air springs or other vertical load supporters can also be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A shock absorber <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is positioned between the semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the subframe rail <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to dampen movement of the semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the shock absorbers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are positioned directly over the axle centerline <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. However, it is to be understood that the shock absorbers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be located anywhere on the semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> carrier housing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is attached to the bridge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the subframe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The carrier housing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes brackets <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which are attached to the bridge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by visco-elastic mounts <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, providing for vibrational damping. The carrier housing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be rotated 180&deg; to change between a rear engine configuration and a front engine configuration by detaching the brackets <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the carrier housing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> from the bridge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the carrier housing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be rigidly mounted to the bridge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the bridge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mounted to the subframe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by the visco-elastic mounts <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A drive line <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> brings rotational drive from a transmission <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, shown schematically, to the carrier housing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. A carden shaft <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> extending from the opposing sides of the carrier housing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to each of the spindles <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> transmits rotational drive from the carrier housing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the spindles <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The suspension module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention having airbags <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> positioned between the airbags supports <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the subframe rails <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be quickly and easily secured to the frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of a vehicle chassis. As the airbags <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are positioned behind the axle centerline <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the suspension module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be easily installed in the vehicle. The independently semi-trailing arms <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the suspension module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> allows for a change in camber with wheel vertical travel, and a toe change that is favorable to vehicle stability. </paragraph>
