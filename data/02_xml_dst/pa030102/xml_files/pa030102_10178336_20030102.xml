<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a valve timing control for a marine drive, more particularly to an improved valve timing control for a marine drive that includes a variable valve timing mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A marine drive such as an outboard motor has a marine propulsion device powered by an engine. The propulsion device typically is a propeller and is submerged when an associated watercraft rests on a body of water. The outboard motor can employ either a two-cycle engine or a four-cycle engine. Recently, however, many outboard motors are offered with four-cycle engines because they provide better emissions control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Typically, a four-cycle engine includes one or more intake and exhaust valve moving between an open position and a closed position. One or more camshafts can be provided to actuate the valves in a timed manner. When the intake valves are open, air is introduced into combustion chambers of the engine through the intake ports. When the exhaust valves open, exhaust gases are discharged from the combustion chambers through the exhaust ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The engine typically includes one or more throttle valves to regulate an amount of air delivered to the combustion chambers. The throttle valves can be operated by the operator with a throttle lever. In general, the more the throttle valves open, the more power is output from the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The engine can include a hydraulically operated variable valve timing (VVT) mechanism that can change the ing and closing timingsof the respective valves by changing an angular position of the camshaft or camshafts. A control device such as, for example, an electronic control unit (ECU) is used to control the VVT mechanism under various control strategies. For instance, the ECU controls the VVT mechanism either to set the valve timing at a fully advanced position for relatively high engine speeds to ensure high charging efficiency and high performance of the engine, or to set the valve timing at a fully retarded position for relatively low engine speeds to ensure high combustion efficiency, fuel economy and good emission control. Otherwise, the ECU controls the VVT mechanism to set the valve timing at a position between the fully advanced position and the fully retarded position in response to a running condition of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The ECU can control the VVT mechanism to provide any position between the fully advanced position and the fully retarded position in response to, for example, a throttle valve position and an engine speed. Because throttle valves typically are cable-actuated the throttle position changes almost simultaneously with throttle lever movements. However, the engine speed changes after a certain delay following a charge in the throttle degree position. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention is the realization that in marine drives, such as, for example, but without limitation, outboard motors, the engine speed can increase more quickly than the VVT system can respond. For example, slippage of the propeller in the body of water or relatively rapid control of the throttle lever by the operator can cause the engine speed to increase significantly more quickly than the VVT system can adjust itself. Additionally, outboard motors offer only a limited space for the VVT mechanism, specifically, for hydraulic circuits thereof. As a result, the valve timing control in marine drives can be unacceptably delayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, an internal combustion engine for a marine drive comprises an engine body. A movable member is movable relative to the engine body. The engine body and the movable member together define a combustion chamber. The engine body defines an air intake port communicating with the combustion chamber. An air induction device communicates with the air intake port to introduce air to the combustion chamber through the air intake port. The air induction device includes a throttle valve arranged to regulate an amount of the air. An air intake valve at the intake port is arranged to move between an open and closed position. A valve actuator is arranged to actuate the intake valve. A change mechanism is arranged to change a timing of the valve actuator at which the valve actuator actuates the intake valve. A control device is configured to control the change mechanism. At least one sensor is configured to detect at least one of a throttle opening the throttle valve, an intake pressure in the air induction device, and an amount of the air in the air induction device. The control is configured to a sudden acceleration state of the engine based at least to the throttle opening, the intake pressure, the air amount, and another operational condition of the engine and detected by another sensor. The control device controls the change mechanism to advance the actuating timing based only upon the throttle opening degree signal, the intake pressure signal, or the air amount signal when the control device determines the sudden acceleration state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an additional aspect of the present invention, an internal combustion engine for a marine drive includes an engine body, and a movable member movable relative to the engine body. The engine body and the movable member together define a combustion chamber. The engine body also defines an air intake port communicating with the combustion chamber. An air induction device communicates with the air intake port to introduce air to the combustion chamber through the air intake port and an air intake valve is arranged to move between an open position and a closed position of the intake port. A valve actuator is configured to actuate the intake valve. A change mechanism is configured to change a timing of the valve actuator at which the valve actuator actuates the intake valve. A control device is configured to control the change mechanism. At least one sensor is configured to sense an operational condition of the engine and to send a signal to the control device, the control device determining a sudden acceleration state of the engine based upon the signal. The control device is configured to control the change mechanism to advance the timing to a preset timing when the control device determines the sudden acceleration state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, a method for controlling an internal combustion engine which includes an intake valve, a valve actuator configured to actuate the intake valve, and a change mechanism configured to change a timing of the valve actuator at which the valve actuator actuates the intake valve, comprises determining a sudden acceleration state of the engine based upon an operational condition of the engine. The method also includes sensing one of a throttle opening, an intake pressure and an air amount, and controlling the change mechanism to advance the actuating timing based only upon at least one of the sensed throttle opening degree, the air intake pressure or the air amount when the sudden acceleration state is determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a still further aspect of the present invention, a method for controlling an internal combustion engine is provided. The engine includes an intake valve, a valve actuator configured to actuate the intake valve, and a change mechanism configured to change a timing of the valve actuator at which the valve actuator actuates the intake valve. The method includes determining a sudden acceleration state of the engine based upon an operational condition of the engine, and controlling the change mechanism to advance the actuating timing to a preset timing when the sudden acceleration is determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a still further aspect of the present invention, an internal combustion engine includes an engine body defining a combustion chamber and an air intake port communicating with the combustion chamber. An air induction device is configured to guide air to the air intake port. An air intake valve is configured to move between a first position in which the air intake port is open and a second position in which the intake port is closed. A valve actuator is configured to move the intake valve between the first and second positions. A valve actuator adjustment mechanism is configured to adjust a timing at which the valve actuator moves the valve between the first and second positions, wherein the adjustment mechanism is configured to operate in at least a first mode in which the adjustment mechanism changes the timing of the valve actuator without regard to a speed of the engine.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an overall construction of an outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that employs an internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> configured in accordance with certain features, aspects and advantages of the present invention is described below. The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has particular utility in the context of a marine drive, such as the board motor, and thus is described in the context of an outboard motor. The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, however, can be used with other types of marine drives (i.e., inboard motors, inboard/outboard motors, jet drives, etc.) and also certain land vehicles. In any of these applications, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be oriented vertically or horizontally. Furthermore, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be used as a stationary engine for some applications that will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated arrangement, the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generally comprises a drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a bracket assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The bracket assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> supports the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on a transom <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of an associated watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and places a marine propulsion device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in a submerged position when the watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rests on a surface of a body of water WL. The bracket assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a steering shaft and a pivot pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The steering shaft typically extends through the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and is affixed to the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by top and bottom mount assemblies <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The steering shaft is pivotally journaled for steering movement about a generally vertically extending steering axis defined within the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of bracket arms that are spaced apart from each other and that are affixed to the watercraft transom <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> completes a hinge coupling between the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends through the bracket arms so that the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> supports the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement about a generally horizontally extending tilt axis defined by the pivot pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> thus can be tilted or trimmed about the pivot pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As used through this description, the terms &ldquo;forward,&rdquo; &ldquo;forwardly&rdquo; and &ldquo;front&rdquo; mean at or to the side where the bracket assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is located, and the terms &ldquo;rear,&rdquo; &ldquo;reverse,&rdquo; &ldquo;backwardly&rdquo; and &ldquo;rearwardly&rdquo; mean at or to the opposite side of the front side, unless indicated otherwise or otherwise readily apparent from the context use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A hydraulic tilt and trim adjustment system <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> preferably is provided between the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for tilt movement (raising or lowering) of the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> relative to the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can have a manually operated system for tilting the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Typically, the term &ldquo;tilt movement&rdquo;, when used in a broad sense, comprises both a tilt movement and a trim adjustment movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The illustrated drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> comprises a power head <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a housing unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which includes a driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a lower unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The power head <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is disposed atop the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and includes the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a protective cowling assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the protective cowling <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which preferably is made of plastic, defines a generally closed cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) in which the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is disposed. The protective cowling assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably is detachably affixed to the bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by a coupling mechanism so that a user, operator, mechanic or repairperson can access the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for maintenance or for other purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably has a rear intake opening <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> on its rear and top portion. A rear intake member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> with a rear air duct <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is affixed to the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The rear intake member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, together with the rear top portion of the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, forms a rear air intake space <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the rear air duct <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> preferably is disposed to the starboard side of a central portion of the rear intake member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> also defines a recessed portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at a front end thereof. An opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is defined along a portion of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the starboard side. The opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> extends into the interior of the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. An outer shell <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is disposed over the recessed portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to define a front air intake space <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. A front air duct <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is affixed to the recessed portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and extends upward from the opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the air flow path into the closed cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can include an elevated entrance from the front air intake space <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The air duct <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> preferably has a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, each of which preferably is cylindrical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A front intake opening (not shown) preferably is defined between the recessed portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the top cowling member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the outer shell <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> so that the front intake space <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> communicates with outside of the cowling assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Ambient air thus is drawn into the closed cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> through the rear intake opening <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or the front intake opening (not shown) and further through the air ducts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Typically, the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> tapers in girth toward its top surface, which is in the general proximity of the air intake opening <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> preferably has an opening <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) through which an upper portion of an exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) extends. The exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> preferably is made of aluminum alloy and is affixed atop the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> together generally form a tray. The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is placed onto this tray and is affixed to the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> also has an exhaust passage through which burnt charges (e.g., exhaust gases) from the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment preferably operates on a four-cycle combustion principle. The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The presently preferred cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> defines four in-line cylinder bores <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which extend generally horizontally and which are generally vertically spaced from one another. As used in this description, the term &ldquo;horizontally&rdquo; means that the subject portions, members or components extend generally in parallel to the water line WL when the associated watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is substantially stationary with respect to the water line WL and when the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is not tilted and is placed in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The term &ldquo;vertically&rdquo; in turn means that portions, members or components extend generally normal to those that extend horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> This type of engine, however, merely exemplifies one type of engine on which various aspects and features of the present invention can be suitably used. Engines having other numbers of cylinders, having other cylinder arrangements (V, opposing, etc.), and operating on other combustion principles (e.g., crankcase compression two-stroke or rotary) also can employ various features, aspects and advantages of the present invention. In addition, the engine can be formed with separate cylinder bodies rather than a number of cylinder bores formed in a cylinder block. Regardless of the particular construction, the engine preferably comprises an engine body that includes at least one cylinder bore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A moveable member, such as a reciprocating piston <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, moves relative to the cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in a suitable manner. In the illustrated arrangement, the piston <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reciprocates within each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is affixed to one end of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to close one end of the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, together with the associated pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and cylinder bores <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, preferably defines four combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Of course, the number of combustion chambers can vary, as indicated above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A crankcase member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> closes the other end of the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and, together with the cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, defines a crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. A crankshaft or output shaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> extends generally vertically through the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and can be journaled for rotation by several bearing blocks (not shown). Connecting rods <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> couple the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> with the respective pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner. Thus, the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can rotate with the reciprocal movement of the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the crankcase member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is located at the forward most position of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, with the cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> being disposed rearward from the crankcase member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Generally, the cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (or individual cylinder bodies), the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the crankcase member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> together define an engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Preferably, at least these major engine portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are made of an aluminum alloy. The aluminum alloy advantageously increases strength over cast iron while decreasing the weight of the engine body <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also comprises an air induction system or device <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The air induction system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> draws air from within the cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The air induction system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> preferably comprises eight intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, four intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a single plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated arrangement, two intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are allotted to each combustion chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the two intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> communicate with a single intake passage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are defined in the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are slidably disposed at the intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> within the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to move between an open and a closed position. As such, the valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> act to open and close the ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to control the flow of air into the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Biasing members, such as springs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), are used to urge the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> toward the respective closed positions by acting against a mounting boss formed on the illustrated cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and a corresponding retainer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> that is affixed to each of the valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. When each intake valve <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is in the open position, the intake passage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that is associated with the intake port <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> communicates with the associated combustion chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each intake passage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> preferably is defined by an intake manifold <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a throttle body <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and an intake runner <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The intake manifold <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the throttle body <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> preferably are made of aluminum alloy. The intake runner <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> preferably is made of plastic. A portion of the illustrated intake runner <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> extends forwardly alongside of and to the front of the crankcase member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the respective portions of the intake runners <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, together with a plenum chamber member <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, define the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the plenum chamber member <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> also is made of plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> comprises an air inlet <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The air in the cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is drawn into the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> through the air inlet <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The air is then passed through intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the throttle body <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the intake manifold <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> acts as an intake silencer to attenuate noise generated by the flow of air into the respective combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Each illustrated throttle body <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> has a butterfly type throttle valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> journaled for pivotal movement about an axis defined by a generally vertically extending valve shaft <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. Each valve shaft <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> can be coupled with the other valve shafts to allow simultaneous movement. The valve shaft <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is operable by the operator through an appropriate conventional throttle valve linkage and a throttle lever connected to the end of the linkage. The throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are movable between an open position and a closed position to meter or regulate an amount of air flowing through the respective air intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Normally, the greater the opening degree, the higher the rate of airflow and the higher the power output of the engine speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In order to bring the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to idle speed and to maintain this speed, the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> generally are substantially closed. Preferably, the valves are not fully closed to produce a more stable idle speed and to prevent sticking of the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> in the closed position. As used through the description, the term &ldquo;idle speed&rdquo; generally means a low engine speed that achieved when the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are closed but also includes a state such that the valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are slightly more open to allow a relatively small amount of air to flow through the intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The air induction system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> preferably includes an auxiliary air device (AAD) (not shown) that bypasses the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and extends from the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to the respective intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> downstream of the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Idle air can be delivered to the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the AAD when the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are placed in a substantially closed or closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The AAD preferably comprises an idle air passage, an idle valve and an idle valve actuator. The idle air passage is branched off to the respective intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The idle valve controls flow through the idle air passage such that the amount of air flow can be more precisely controlled. Preferably, the idle valve is a needle valve that can move between an open position and a closed position, which closes the idle air passage. The idle valve actuator actuates the idle valve to a certain position to meter or adjust an amount of the idle air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also comprises an exhaust system that routes burnt charges, i.e., exhaust gases, to a location outside of the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> preferably has two exhaust ports (not shown) defined in the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The exhaust ports can be selectively opened and closed by exhaust valves. The exhaust valves are schematically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, described below, and identified by reference numeral <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. The construction of each exhaust valve and the arrangement of the exhaust valves are substantially the same as the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the arrangement thereof, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> An exhaust manifold (not shown) preferably is disposed next to the exhaust ports (not shown) and extends generally vertically. The exhaust manifold communicates with the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the exhaust ports to collect exhaust gases therefrom. The exhaust manifold is coupled with the foregoing exhaust passage of the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. When the exhaust ports are opened, the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> communicate with the exhaust passage through the exhaust manifold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a valve cam mechanism or valve actuator <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> preferably is provided for actuating the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the exhaust valves <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). In the illustrated arrangement, the valve cam mechanism <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> includes an intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and an exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> both extending generally vertically and journaled for rotation relative to the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated arrangement, bearing caps <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) journal the camshafts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> with the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A camshaft cover <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> is affixed to the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to define a camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> together with the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Each camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, has cam lobes <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> to push valve lifters <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> that are affixed to the respective ends of the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and exhaust valves <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) as in any suitable manner. The cam lobes <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> repeatedly push the valve lifters <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> in a timed manner, which is in proportion to the engine speed. The movement of the lifters <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> generally is timed by the rotation of the camshafts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to actuate the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the exhaust valves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> camshaft drive mechanism <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> drives the valve cam mechanism <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and the exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> include an intake driven sprocket <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> positioned atop the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and an exhaust driven sprocket <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> positioned atop the exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. The crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> has a drive sprocket <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> positioned at an upper portion thereof. Of course, other locations of the sprockets also can be used. The illustrated arrangement, however, advantageously results in a compactly arranged engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A timing chain or belt <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is wound around the driven sprockets <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. The crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> thus drives the respective camshafts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> through the timing chain <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> in the timed relationship. Because the camshafts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> must rotate at half of the speed of the rotation of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in the four-cycle combustion principle, a diameter of the driven sprockets <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is twice as large as a diameter of the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> preferably has a port or manifold fuel injection system. The fuel injection system preferably comprises four fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> with one fuel injector allotted for each of the respective combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through suitable fuel conduits <highlight><bold>199</bold></highlight>. The fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> are mounted on a fuel rail <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which is mounted on the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The fuel rail <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also defines a portion of the fuel conduits <highlight><bold>199</bold></highlight>. Each fuel injector <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> preferably has an injection nozzle directed toward the associated intake passage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> adjacent to the intake ports <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> spray fuel into the intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> under control of an ECU which preferably is mounted on the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at an appropriate location. The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) controls both the start timing and the duration of the fuel injection cycle of the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> so that the nozzles spray a proper amount of the fuel for each combustion cycle. The fuel injection controller within the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> with reference numeral <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and is described below. Of course, the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> can be disposed for direct cylinder injection and carburetors can replace or accompany the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> further comprises an ignition or firing system. Each combustion chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided with a spark plug <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> that is connected to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) through an igniter so that ignition timing is also controlled by the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Each spark plug <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> has electrodes that are exposed into the associated combustion chamber and are spaced apart from each other with a small gap. The spark plugs <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> generate a spark between the electrodes to ignite an air/fuel charge in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at selected ignition timing under control of the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reciprocate between top dead center and bottom dead center. When the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> makes two rotations, the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> generally move from the top dead center to the bottom dead center (the intake stroke), from the bottom dead center to the top dead center (the compression stroke), from the top dead center to the bottom dead center (the power stroke) and from the bottom dead center to the top dead center (the exhaust stroke). During the four strokes of the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the camshafts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> make one rotation and actuate the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the exhaust valves <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) to open the intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> during the intake stroke and to open exhaust ports during the exhaust stroke, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Generally, during the intake stroke, air is drawn into the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the air intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and fuel is injected into the intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. The air and the fuel thus are mixed to form the air/fuel charge in the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Slightly before or during the power stroke, the respective spark plugs <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> ignite the compressed air/fuel charge in the respective combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The air/fuel charge thus rapidly burns during the power stroke to move the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The burnt charge, i.e., exhaust gases, then are discharged from the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> during the exhaust stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> During engine operation, heat builds in the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The illustrated engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> thus includes a cooling system to cool the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably employs an open-loop type water cooling system that introduces cooling water from the body of water surrounding the motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and then discharges the water to the body of water. The cooling system includes one or more water jackets defined within the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> through which the water travels to remove heat from the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also preferably includes a lubrication system. A closed-loop type system is employed in the illustrated embodiment. The lubrication system comprises a lubricant tank defining a reservoir, which preferably is positioned within the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. An oil pump (not shown) is provided at a desired location, such as atop the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, to pressurize the lubricant oil in the reservoir and to pass the lubricant oil through a suction pipe toward certain engine portions, which desirably are lubricated, through lubricant delivery passages. The engine portions that need lubrication include, for example, the crankshaft bearings (not shown), the connecting rods <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Portions <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the delivery passages (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) can be defined in the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Lubricant return passages (not shown) also are provided to return the oil to the lubricant tank for re-circulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A flywheel assembly <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) preferably is positioned at an upper end of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and is mounted for rotation with the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The flywheel assembly <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> comprises a flywheel magneto or AC generator that supplies electric power to various electrical components such as the fuel injection system, the ignition system and the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). A protective cover <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, which preferably is made of plastic, extends over majority of the top surface of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and preferably covers the portion that includes the fly wheel assembly <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and the camshaft drive mechanism <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The protective cover <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> preferably has a rib <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) that reduces or eliminates the amount of air flowing directly toward the engine portion that has the air induction system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, i.e., to the portion on the starboard side. The protective cover <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> also preferably has a rib <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) that substantially or completely inhibits air from flowing directly toward a front portion of the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The ribs <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> advantageously help direct the airflow around the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to cool the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A seal member <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is inserted between the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and the bearing cap <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to inhibit the lubricant from leaking out. It should be noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</cross-reference> illustrate the delivery passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> in a schematic fashion. The passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> do not merge together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The control section <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> preferably includes an oil control valve (OCV) <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> comprises a housing section <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and a cylinder section <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Both the housing and cylinder sections <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> preferably are received in the bearing cap <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. Because the sections <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> together extend through a hole of the camshaft cover <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>, a bellow <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> made of rubber is provided between the housing section <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and the camshaft cover <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> to close and seal the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The cylinder section <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> defines the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> that communicates with the supply passage <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and the delivery passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>. The housing section <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> preferably encloses a solenoid type actuator, although other actuators of course are available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> extends into the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> from the actuator and is axially movable therein. The rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> has a pair of valves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and a pair of guide portions <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The valves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and the guide portions <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> have an outer diameter that is larger than an outer diameter of the remainder portions <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and is generally equal to an inner diameter of the cylinder section <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. The rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> defines an internal passage <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> extending through the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and apertures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> communicating with the passage <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to allow free flow of the lubricant in the chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A coil spring <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> is retained in a spring retaining space <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> at an end of the cylinder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> opposite to the housing section <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to urge the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> toward the actuator. The lubricant can be drained to the camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> through the spring retaining chamber <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> and a drain hole <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The actuator, i.e., solenoid, actuates the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> under control of the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) so that the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> can take any position in the chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the solenoid pushes the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> toward a position in compliance with commands of the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. If a certain position designated by the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is closer to the solenoid than a current position, then the solenoid does not actuate the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and the coil spring <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> pushes back the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to the desired position. Alternatively, the solenoid pulls the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> back to the position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The valve <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> can close the port <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> entirely or partially, and the valve <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> can close the port <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> entirely or partially. The extent to which the valves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> allow the ports <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to communicate with the chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> determines an amount of the lubricant that is allotted to each delivery passage <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> and to each space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the adjusting section <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The amount of lubricant delivered to each space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> thus determines an angular position of the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. If more lubricant is allotted to the first space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> than to the second space S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is adjusted closer to the fully advanced position, and vise versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In operation, the oil pump pressurizes the lubricant oil to the supply passage <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and further to the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) controls the solenoid. The solenoid moves the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and thus adjusts the degree to which the valves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> allow the chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to communicate with the ports <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, respectively. The ECU thereby controls the angular position of the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Preferably, a drain is provided to allow the lubricant oil to drain from the space that is being evacuated while pressurized lubricant oil flows into the opposing space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In one mode of operation, for example, the lubricant oil is fed to the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Thus, the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> has a positive pressure. To move the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> in a first direction relative to the input sprocket <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is linked with the delivery passage <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> while the other of the delivery passage <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> is linked to a drain. Thus, pressurized oil will flow into the first space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> while oil will be displaced from the second space S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The displaced oil flows through the passage <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> and to the drain <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and thereby returns to the lubrication system. Once the desired movement has occurred, the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is returned to a neutral position in which the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is no longer communicating with either of the delivery passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>. Additionally, in the neutral position, neither of the delivery passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> communicates with the drain in one particularly advantageous arrangement. Of course, by varying the placement and size of the seals, a constant flow can be produced from supply to drain while the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is in a neutral position. Also, a constant flow into the delivery lines also can be constructed. In the illustrated arrangement, however, no flow preferably occurs with the system in a neutral position. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The camshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is associated with the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> to sense an angular position of the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and sends a camshaft angle position signal to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through the signal line. The crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is associated with the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to sense an angle position of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and sends a crankshaft angular position signal to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through the signal line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Both the camshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and the crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> in the present system generate pulses as the respective signals. The pulse of the camshaft position sensor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> can give an actual angular position of the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. The crankshaft position signal together with the camshaft position signal allows the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to accurately determine the position of the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> in relation to the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> preferably is disposed atop the valve shaft <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to sense an angular position between the open and closed angular positions of the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and sends a throttle valve position signal to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through the signal lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The intake sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> preferably is disposed either within one of the intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or within the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to sense an intake pressure therein. Because the respective intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are formed such that each generally is the same size as the others, and because the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> collects a large volume of air that is supplied to each of the intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, every passage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has substantially equal pressure and a signal of the intake pressure sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> thus can represent a condition of the respective pressure. Thus, it should be appreciated that a single pressure sensor or multiple pressure sensors can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The throttle valve position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and the intake pressure sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> preferably are selected from a type of sensor that indirectly senses an amount of air in the induction system. Another type of sensor that directly senses the air amount, of course, can be applicable. For example, moving vane types, heated wire types and Karman Vortex types of air flow meters also can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The operator&apos;s demand or engine load, as determined by the throttle opening degree, is sensed by the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. Generally, in proportion to the change of the throttle opening degree, the intake air pressure also varies and is sensed by the intake pressure sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. The throttle valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is opened when the operator operates the throttle lever to increase power output of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and thus the speed of the watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The intake pressure almost simultaneously decreases as the throttle valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> opens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The engine load can also increase when the associated watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> advances against wind. In this situation, the operator also operates the throttle lever to recover the speed that may be lost. Therefore, as used in this description, the term &ldquo;acceleration&rdquo; means not only the acceleration in the narrow sense but also the recovery of speed by the operator in a broad sense. Also, the term &ldquo;sudden acceleration&rdquo; means the sudden acceleration in the narrow sense and a quick recovery of speed by the operator in a broad sense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The signal lines preferably are configured with hard-wires or wire-harnesses. The signals can be sent through emitter and detector pairs, infrated radiation, radio waves or the like. The type of signal and the type of connection can be varied between sensors or the same type can be used with all sensors which are described above and additional sensors described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Signals from other sensors or control signals also can be used for the control by the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. In the present control system, various sensors other than the sensors <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> are also provided to sense the operational condition of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, an oil pressure sensor <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, a water temperature sensor <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, an engine body temperature sensor <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, a knock sensor <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>, a transmission position sensor <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight>, an oxygen sensor <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> for determining a current air/fuel ratio, and an intake air temperature sensor <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> are provided in the present control system. The sensors except for the transmission position sensor <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight>, can sense the operational conditions of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and send signals to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through respective sensor signal lines. The transmission position sensor <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> senses whether the transmission <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is placed at the forward, neutral or reverse position and sends a transmission position signal to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through the signal line. An ignition control signal <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, a fuel injection control signal <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight>, and an AAD control signal <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> are also used by the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> for control of the spark plugs <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, and the AAD (not shown), respectively. The foregoing sensors <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and the control signals <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight>, in a broad sense, define sensors <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> that sense operational conditions of the engine and/or the outboard motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be designed as a feedback control device using the signals of the sensors. The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> preferably has a central processing unit (CPU) and some storage units which stores various control maps typically defining relationships between parameters such as, for example, the engine speed, the throttle valve position and the intake pressure (and/or an amount of intake air) to determine an optimum control conditions. The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> then controls the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> and other actuators in accordance with the determined control condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The fuel injection control unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be in the form of a hard-wired circuit, a dedicated processor and memory, or a general purpose processor and memory running a control program. Other units described below, can also be constructed as a hard-wired circuit, a dedicated processor and memory, or a general purpose processor and memory running one or a plurality of control programs. However, for easier understanding of the reader, the units will be described as if they were discriminate and substantial units. The illustrated fuel injection control unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> controls the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> using at least the throttle position signal from the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and the intake pressure signal from the intake pressure sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> preferably comprises, other than the fuel injection control unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, an actual camshaft angular position calculation (ACAPC) unit <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>, an engine speed calculation unit <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>, a target camshaft angular position calculation (TCAPC) unit <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, and a control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. The TCAPC unit <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> and the control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> together form an OCV control section <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> in the illustrated ECU configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The ACAPC unit <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> preferably receives the actual camshaft angular position signal from the camshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and the crankshaft angular position signal, which gives two possible ranges of camshaft angular position, from the crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. The ACAPC unit <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> then calculates a deviation value which indicates how much the actual camshaft angular position deviates within the two possible ranges of camshaft angular position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The engine speed calculation unit <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> receives the crankshaft angular position signal from the crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> and calculates an engine speed using the signal versus time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The TCAPC unit <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> receives the deviation value from the ACAPC unit <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>, the engine speed from the engine speed calculation unit <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> and at least one of the throttle valve opening degree signal from the throttle valve position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and the intake pressure signal from the intake pressure sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. The TCAPC unit <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> then calculates a target camshaft angular, position based upon the deviation value, the engine speed and either the throttle valve opening degree signal or the intake pressure signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> receives the target camshaft angular position from the TCAPC unit <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> and calculates a control value of the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. That is, the control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> determines how much oil should be delivered to either the space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the space S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the adjusting section <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> based upon the target camshaft angular position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Under a normal running condition and an ordinary acceleration condition (i.e.,. not sudden acceleration condition), the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> preferably uses either a combination of the throttle valve opening degree signal with the engine speed signal (&agr;-N method) or a combination of the intake pressure signal with the engine speed signal (D-j method) to calculate the target camshaft angular position. Otherwise, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can use a mixed combination of the &agr;-N method and the D-j method under the normal running condition or the ordinary acceleration condition. The &agr;-N method, the D-j method and the mixed combination thereof are disclosed in, for example, a co-pending U.S. application filed Feb. 14, 2002, titled CONTROL SYSTEM FOR MARINE ENGINE, which Ser. No. is 10/078,275, the entire contents of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. An air amount signal sensed by the air flow meter noted above can be applied additionally or instead either the intake pressure signal or the throttle opening degree signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Under a sudden acceleration condition, the illustrated ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> uses only the throttle opening degree signal. That is, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> always determines, at least prior to controlling the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> with the OCV control section <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>, whether the operator wishes sudden acceleration or not. The sudden acceleration condition preferably is determined when a change rate of the throttle opening degree signal, a change rate of the intake pressure signal or a change rate of the engine speed calculated by the engine speed calculation unit <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> becomes greater than a predetermined magnitude. A change rate of the air amount signal also can be used to determine the sudden acceleration condition. Theoretically, the predetermined magnitude can be set at any magnitude larger than zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> schematically illustrates how the engine speed <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> changes and how the valve timing (i.e., camshaft angular position) <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is controlled with the throttle opening degree <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> increasing. The engine speed <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> starts increasing later than the throttle opening degree <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> starts increasing with delay time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This delay time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is essential because the change of the engine speed always depends from the change of the throttle opening degree. Further, the valve timing <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> starts advancing later than the engine speed <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> starts increasing with delay time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is caused by electrical response delay plus delay time T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is caused by mechanical response delay. This behavior is represented by the dashed line <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> These delays do not cause any significant problems when the engine operates under either the normal running condition or the ordinary acceleration condition. However, the delay time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> cannot be ignored when the engine operates under the sudden acceleration condition. If the valve timing starts advancing with the delay time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an error from the characteristic <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> can be unacceptable. Therefore, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in the present control system uses only the throttle opening degree signal to calculate the target camshaft angular position. As such, the delay time can be reduced to the time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, illustrated by line <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can use either the air intake pressure signal or the air amount signal instead of the throttle opening degree signal during a sudden acceleration scenario. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Also, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can set a particular and fixed camshaft angular position as the target camshaft angular position when the sudden acceleration condition is determined. The particular and fixed camshaft angular position can be a fully advanced camshaft angular position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Of course, the foregoing description is that of preferred controls having certain features, aspects and advantages in accordance with the present invention. Various changes and modifications also may be made to the above-described controls without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the claims. </paragraph>
