<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to plumbing fixtures. More specifically, the instant invention is drawn to a decorative basket strainer for use with a kitchen sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Society has become very sensitive to the comforts of home and the effect of its presentation to the homeowner and guests. The media has focused attention on charm and personal styling which defines the &ldquo;feng shui&rdquo; of a particular room or space. It is only natural that this decorative attention should be extended to the drain area of the kitchen sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The prior art abounds with devices designed to heighten the aesthetic pleasures of the common kitchen sink. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. Des. 255,706 (Adam) and Des. 278,459 (Cook) disclose ornamental designs for sink strainers. The former patentee merely provides a decorative cover for the strainer. The latter named patentee incorporates a strainer flange having a decorative geometric design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. Des. 195,162 (Kraines) and Des. 392,371 (Holcombe) show ornamental designs for drain stoppers. The instant patents are not concerned with providing a straining function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An ornamental design for a perforated drain cover is disclose in U.S. Pat. No. Des. 263,776 (Ashley). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. Des. 413,656 (Mauk), Des. 418,209 (Mauk) and U.S. D439,957 S (Barnett et al.) disclose ornamental designs for grate structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,586,203 (Westgerdes) and 4,706,306 (Smith) show strainer structure. The patentees are not concerned with aesthetics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,265,281 (McAlpine) and 5,535,455 (Liu) disclose stoppers for garbage disposal inlets. As in the patents cited immediately above, the instant patents are not concerned with aesthetic values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> None of the above inventions and patents, taken either singly or in combination, is seen to disclose a decorative strainer as will be subsequently described and claimed in the instant invention. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The decorative strainer of the instant invention is adapted for use with a kitchen sink. As contemplated, the strainer basket will be fabricated from stainless steel, however, plastic or other suitable materials may be employed. The strainer basket is of a semi-hemispheric configuration having a continuous, apertured wall. The diameter of the wall is such that the strainer basket will fit a standard sink drain opening as is common in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Instead of the utilitarian-only gripping post of prior art strainers, the instant invention is provided with a gripping post which is designed as a replica of an object suitable to add an aesthetic touch to the sink and kitchen. For example, the decorative gripping post may take the form of a bunch of grapes, a refrigerator, a baseball or any of a myriad of decorative items. The decorative gripping post may be removably secured to the basket so that a user may readily change the decorative look. The decorative post may be fabricated from any suitable, durable material (ceramic, resin, plastic, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention to provide a durable strainer for a kitchen sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide a strainer for a kitchen sink, which strainer includes a decorative gripping post. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to provide a strainer for a kitchen sink which includes a removable decorative gripping post. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to provide improved elements and arrangements thereof in an apparatus for the purposes described which are inexpensive, dependable and fully effective in accomplishing their intended purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the present invention comprises a strainer basket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having apertured walls. The apertures are of a size (common in the art) to retain solid matter while allowing liquids to pass therethrough. As noted above, basket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fabricated from stainless steel or other durable and suitable materials. Basket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to fit a standard sink drain opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Each strainer basket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with a gripping post for inserting and removing the basket from the drain opening. As contemplated, the gripping post will assume a form which replicates an object that would lend a decorative theme to the sink and kitchen. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the gripping post replicates a watermelon slice <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, while in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the gripping post replicates an apple <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Each decorative gripping post will assume the color of the represented object so as to be as authentic-looking as possible. As contemplated, the post is removably attached to the basket so that other decorative posts may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the gripping post assumes the form of a golf ball <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and includes structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for plugging the drain, if desired. The drain plugging structure is not part of the inventive concept, per se, and incorporates structure well known in the art. The invention may employ any suitable and conventional means (screw threads, adhesive, etc.) to accomplish removal and attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Although described in conjunction with a kitchen sink, it is obvious that the invention may be applied to the bathroom, laundry or any area that includes a sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the sole embodiment described above, but encompasses any and all embodiments within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
