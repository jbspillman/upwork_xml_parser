<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to mass spectrometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In many tandem mass spectrometers ions are fragmented in a collision or fragmentation cell. A known fragmentation cell comprises a multipole (e.g. a quadrupole or hexapole) rod set wherein adjacent rods are connected to opposite phases of an RF voltage supply. The quadrupole or hexapole collision cell is housed in a cylindrical housing which is open at an upstream end and at a downstream end to allow ions to enter and exit the collision cell. The housing includes a gas inlet port through which a collision or buffer gas, typically nitrogen or argon, is introduced into the collision cell. The collision cell is maintained at a pressure of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>&minus;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>mbar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Ions entering the collision cell are arranged to be sufficiently energetic so that when they collide with the collision or buffer gas at least some of the ions will fragment into daughter or fragment ions by means of Collisional Induced Dissociation/Decomposition (&ldquo;CID&rdquo;). Ions in the collision cell will also become thermalised after they have undergone a few collisions i.e. their kinetic energy will be considerably reduced, and this leads to greater radial confinement of the ions in the presence of the RF electric field. In order to ensure that ions are sufficiently energetic so as to fragment when entering the collision cell, the collision cell is typically maintained at a DC potential which is offset from that of the ion source by approximately &minus;30V DC or more (for positive ions). Once ions have fragmented and have been thermalised within the collision cell, their low kinetic energy is such that they will tend to remain within the collision cell. In practice, ions are observed to exit the collision cell after a relatively long period of time, and this is believed to be due to the effects of diffusion and the repulsive effect of further ions being admitted into the collision cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one of the problems associated with the known collision cell is that ions tend to have a relatively long residence time within the collision cell. This is problematic for certain types of mass spectrometry methods since it is necessary to wait until ions have exited the collision cell before further ions are admitted into it. For example, in MS/MS (i.e. fragmentation) modes of operation if a quadrupole mass filter Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (MS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) upstream of a collision cell Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is scanned rapidly compared to the typical empty time (&tilde;30 ms) of ions to exit the collision cell Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, then the peaks in the resulting parent ion scanning mass spectrum will suffer from peak tailing towards higher mass and thus the resulting mass spectrum will suffer from relatively poor resolution. An example of this is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Similarly, in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) experiments the upstream quadrupole mass filter Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (MS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is switched rapidly to cyclically transmit a number of parent ions (e.g. P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> . . . Pn) in a multiplexed manner, and the long empty times of ions to exit the collision cell Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may result in cross-talk between the various channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Long empty times of ions to exit the collision cell Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also problematic when the mass spectrometer is being used in on-line chromatography applications since each peak only elutes over a short period of time and the mass spectrometer will have to acquire data very rapidly if a full parent (precursor) ion spectrum is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore desired to provide an improved collision or fragmentation cell for use in a mass spectrometer which does not suffer from some or all of the problems discussed above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mass spectrometer comprising: a fragmentation cell in which ions are fragmented in use, the fragmentation cell comprising a plurality of electrodes having apertures through which ions are transmitted in use, wherein at least some of the electrodes are connected to both a DC and an AC or RF voltage supply and wherein an axial DC voltage gradient or difference is maintained in use along at least a portion of the length of the fragmentation cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The preferred collision or fragmentation cell differs from a conventional multipole collision cell in that instead of comprising four or six elongated rod electrodes, the fragmentation cell comprises a number (e.g. typically &gt;100) of ring, annular or plate like electrodes having apertures, preferably circular, through which ions are transmitted. Furthermore, an axial DC voltage gradient is preferably maintained across at least a portion of the length of the fragmentation cell, preferably the whole length of the fragmentation cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The fragmentation cell according to the preferred embodiment is capable of being emptied of and filled with ions much faster than a conventional collision cell.

Preferably, at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95% of the electrodes are connected to both a DC and an AC or RF voltage supply. According to a one embodiment, an axial DC voltage difference of approximately 3V may be maintained along the whole length of the fragmentation cell (i.e. for positive ions, electrodes at the downstream end of the fragmentation cell are maintained at a DC voltage approximately 3V below electrodes at the upstream end of the fragmentation cell). In other embodiments the axial DC voltage difference maintained along at least a portion, preferably the whole length, of the fragmentation cell is 0.1-0.5 V, 0.5-1.0 V, 1.0-1.5 V, 1.5-2.0 V, 2.0-2.5 V, 2.5-3.0 V, 3.0-3.5 V, 3.5-4.0 V, 4.0-4.5 V, 4.5-5.0 V, 5.0-5.5 V, 5.5-6.0 V, 6.0-6.5 V, 6.5-7.0 V, 7.0-7.5 V, 7.5-8.0 V, 8.0-8.5 V, 8.5-9.0 V, 9.0-9.5 V, 9.5-10.0 V or &gt;10V. </paragraph>

The term &ldquo;voltage gradient&rdquo; should be construed broadly to cover embodiments wherein the DC voltage offset of electrodes along the length of the fragmentation cell relative to the DC potential of the ion source varies at different points along the length of the fragmentation cell.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A preferred ion tunnel collision or fragmentation cell will now be described in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The ion tunnel fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a reasonably gas tight housing having a relatively small entrance aperture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a relatively small exit aperture <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The entrance and exit apertures <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are preferably 2.2 mm diameter substantially circular apertures. The plates forming the entrance and/or exit apertures <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be connected to independent programmable DC voltage supplies (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Between the plate forming the entrance aperture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the plate forming the exit aperture <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are arranged a number of electrically isolated ion tunnel segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>In one embodiment fifteen segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are provided. Each ion tunnel segment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a;</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b;</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>comprises two interleaved and electrically isolated sections i.e. an upper and lower section. The ion tunnel segment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>closest to the entrance aperture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> preferably comprises ten electrodes (with five electrodes in each section) and the remaining ion tunnel segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>preferably each comprise eight electrodes (with four electrodes in each section). All the electrodes are preferably substantially similar in that they have a central substantially circular aperture (preferably 5 mm in diameter) through which ions are transmitted. The entrance and exit apertures <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are preferably smaller (e.g. 2.2 mm in diameter) than the apertures in the electrodes, and this helps to reduce the amount of collision gas leaking out of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the vacuum chamber containing the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is preferably maintained at a lower pressure e.g. 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>mbar or less. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A single ion tunnel section is shown in greater detail in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The ion tunnel section has four (or five) electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, each electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a 5 mm diameter central aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The four (or five) electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> depend or extend from a common bar or spine <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and are preferably truncated at the opposite end to the bar <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Each electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is typically 0.5 mm thick. Two ion tunnel sections are interlocked or interleaved to provide a total of eight (or ten) electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in an ion tunnel segment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a;</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b;</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>with a 1 mm inter-electrode spacing once the two sections have been interleaved.

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Each ion tunnel segment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a;</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b;</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is mounted on a machined PEEK support that acts as the support for the entire assembly. Individual ion tunnel sections are located and fixed to the PEEK support by means of a dowel and a screw. The screw is also used to provide the electrical connection to the ion tunnel section. The PEEK supports are held in the correct orientation by two stainless steel plates attached to the PEEK supports using screws and located correctly using dowels. These plates are electrically isolated and have a voltage applied to them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Collision gas is supplied to the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via a 4.5 mm ID tube. Another tube may be connected to a vacuum gauge allowing the pressure in the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be monitored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The electrical connections shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) are such that a substantially regular stepped axial accelerating DC electric field is provided along the length of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using two programmable DC power supplies DC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and DC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a resistor potential divider network of 1 M&OHgr; resistors. An AC or RF voltage supply provides phase (RF&plus;) and anti-phase (RF&minus;) voltages at a frequency of preferably 1.75 MHz and is coupled to the ion tunnel sections <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>via capacitors which are preferably identical in value (100 pF). According to other embodiments the frequency may be in the range of 0.1-3.0 MHz. Four 10 &mgr;H inductors are provided in the DC supply rails to reduce any RF feedback onto the DC supplies. A regular stepped axial DC voltage gradient is provided if all the resistors are of the same value. Similarly, the same AC or RF voltage is supplied to all the electrodes if all the capacitors are the same value. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows how, in one embodiment, the axial DC potential varies across a 10 cm central portion of the ion tunnel fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The inter-segment voltage step in this particular embodiment is &minus;1V. However, according to more preferred embodiments lower voltage steps of e.g. approximately &minus;0.2V may be used. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a potential energy surface across several ion tunnel segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at a central portion of the ion tunnel fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As can be seen, the potential energy profile is such that ions will cascade from one ion tunnel segment to the next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows another embodiment wherein the ion tunnel fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> also traps, accumulates or otherwise confines ions within the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the DC voltage applied to the final ion tunnel segment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(i.e. that closest and adjacent to the exit aperture <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is independently controllable and can in one mode of operation be maintained at a relatively high DC blocking or trapping potential (DC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) which is more positive for positively charged ions (and vice versa for negatively charged ions) than the preceding ion tunnel segment(s) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Other embodiments are also contemplated wherein other ion tunnel segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may alternatively and/or additionally be maintained at a relatively high trapping potential. When the final ion tunnel segment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is being used to trap ions within the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an AC or RF voltage may or may not be applied to the final ion tunnel segment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The DC voltage supplied to the plates forming the entrance and exit apertures <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also preferably independently controllable and preferably no AC or RF voltage is supplied to these plates. Embodiments are also contemplated wherein a relatively high DC trapping potential may be applied to the plates forming entrance and/or exit aperture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in addition to or instead of a trapping potential being supplied to one or more ion tunnel segments such as at least the final ion tunnel segment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In order to release ions from confinement within the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the DC trapping potential applied to e.g. the final ion tunnel segment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>or to the plate forming the exit aperture <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is preferably momentarily dropped or varied, preferably in a pulsed manner. In one embodiment the DC voltage may be dropped to approximately the same DC voltage as is being applied to neighbouring ion tunnel segment(s) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Embodiments are also contemplated wherein the voltage may be dropped below that of neighbouring ion tunnel segment(s) so as to help accelerate ions out of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment a V-shaped trapping potential may be applied which is then changed to a linear profile having a negative gradient in order to cause ions to be accelerated out of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The voltage on the plate forming the exit aperture <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can also be set to a DC potential such as to cause ions to be accelerated out of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Other less preferred embodiments are contemplated wherein no axial DC voltage difference or gradient is applied or maintained along the length of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, for example, shows how the DC potential may vary along a portion of the length of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when no axial DC field is applied and the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is acting in a trapping or accumulation mode. In this figure, 0 mm corresponds to the midpoint of the gap between the fourteenth <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and fifteenth (and final) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>ion tunnel segments. In this particular example, the blocking potential was set to &plus;5V (for positive ions) and was applied to the last (fifteenth) ion tunnel segment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>only. The preceding fourteen ion tunnel segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>had a potential of &minus;1V applied thereto. The plate forming the entrance aperture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was maintained at 0V DC and the plate forming the exit aperture <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was maintained at &minus;1V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> More complex modes of operation are contemplated wherein two or more trapping potentials may be used to isolate one or more section(s) of the ion tunnel fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows a portion of the axial DC potential profile for a fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment operated in a &ldquo;fill&rdquo; mode of operation, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows a corresponding &ldquo;closed&rdquo; mode of operation, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) shows a corresponding &ldquo;empty&rdquo; mode of operation. By sequencing the potentials, the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be opened, closed and then emptied in a short defined pulse. In the example shown in the figures, 0 mm corresponds to the midpoint of the gap between the tenth and eleventh ion tunnel segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The first nine segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are held at &minus;1V, the tenth and fifteenth segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>act as potential barriers and ions are trapped within the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The trap segments are held at a higher DC potential (&plus;5V) than the other segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>When closed the potential barriers are held at &plus;5V and when open they are held at &minus;1V or &minus;5V. This arrangement allows ions to be continuously accumulated and stored, even during the period when some ions are being released for subsequent mass analysis, since ions are free to continually enter the first nine segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a,</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>A relatively long upstream length of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be used for trapping and storing ions and a relatively short downstream length may be used to hold and then release ions. By using a relatively short downstream length, the pulse width of the packet of ions released from the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be constrained. In other embodiments multiple isolated storage regions may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> According to a particularly preferred embodiment, axial DC voltage gradients may additionally be applied along at least a portion of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to enhance the speed of the device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the effect of applying various axial DC voltage differences or gradients along the whole length of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when performing parent ion scans of reserpine. An upstream quadrupole mass filter Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (MS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) was scanned from 600 to 620 amu in a time of 20 ms with an interscan delay (&ldquo;ISD&rdquo;) of 10 ms (during which time the RF voltage applied to the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was momentarily pulsed to zero for 5 ms so as to empty the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and after which the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was allowed to recover for a further 5 ms). The fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was set to operate in a fragmentation mode with the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being held at approx. 35V DC below the DC potential at which the ion source is held so that ions are sufficiently energetic when entering the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that they fragment when they collide with collision gas in the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A downstream quadrupole mass filter Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (MS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) was set so as to transmit only daughter ions having a mass to charge ratio of 195. The sample used was 50 pg/&mgr;l reserpine (having a mass to charge ratio of 609) infused at 5 &mgr;l/min. Results are shown for applied axial DC voltage differences of 0V, 3V, 5V and 10V across the length of the whole fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The ordinate axis indicates the intensity of daughter ions (having a mass to charge ratio equal to 195) which were observed. As can be seen, when no axial DC voltage difference was maintained hardly any daughter ions were observed exiting the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during the timescale of the scan (20 ms). The daughter ions are still produced in the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, but once thermalised they will have relatively low axial velocities and the absence of any axial DC voltage difference means that the daughter ions will tend not to exit the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during the 20 ms that the upstream quadrupole mass filter Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (MS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is being scanned. The greatest intensity of daughter ions was observed when an axial DC voltage difference of 3V was maintained along the whole length of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. For reasons which are not fully understood, when higher axial DC voltage differences of 5V and 10V were maintained, the resulting intensity of daughter ions exiting the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was observed to drop. This may possibly be due to ions becoming defocussed when higher axial DC voltage differences were maintained across the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the result that some ions, when exiting the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, may impinge upon the plate forming the relatively small (2.2 mm) exit aperture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and hence be lost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> With conventional multipole collision cells there exists a problem of cross talk in that subsequent acquisitions may contain ions from a previous acquisition. In order to reduce this cross talk it is known to pulse the RF voltage applied to the collision cell to zero for 5 ms in order to clear the collision cell of ions. Thereafter, the collision cell is left for &tilde;30 ms enabling the collision cell to recover, fill up with ions and equilibrate before acquiring the next data point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In order to maintain a reasonable duty cycle at short acquisition (scan or dwell) times, the recovery time period must also be correspondingly short. However, if the time period allowed for recovery is too short (i.e. &lt;30 ms) then the conventional collision cell does not have enough time to refill with ions with the result that a decrease in signal intensity is observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the effect of shortening the dwell time when using the preferred ion tunnel collision cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the intensity of ions observed with 10 &mgr;l loop injections of reserpine into 200 &mgr;l/min 50% Aqu. MeCN. The interscan delay was set to 10 ms in all cases. The upstream quadrupole Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (MS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) was set to transmit ions having a mass to charge ratio of 609 and the downstream quadrupole Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (MS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) was fixed to transmit ions having a mass to charge ratio of 195. The fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was set to operate in a fragmentation mode (i.e. the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was maintained at a DC bias of 35V relative to the ion source). An axial DC voltage difference of 3V was maintained along the length of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. During the interscan delay the RF voltage was pulsed to zero for 5 ms and then the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was left to recover for 5 ms. The figure shows that for acquisition (dwell) times of 1000 ms down to 10 ms there is negligible effect on the observed intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the preferred embodiment equilibrates within approx. 3 ms and so has no problem operating at inter-scan delays of 10 ms unlike conventional collision cells without axial voltage gradients which can require an inter-scan delay of up to approx. 35 ms for maximum sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows data relating to the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being operated in a non-fragmenting mode without any collision gas being present in the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The DC bias was equal throughout the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and was set to 3V i.e. no axial DC voltage gradient was maintained. As can be seen, for ions of relatively low mass to charge ratio (e.g. 81 and 117) the amplitude of the RF voltage supply should be relatively low in order for these ions to be efficiently transmitted, whereas for ions of higher mass to charge ratio (e.g. 1081, 1544 and 2034) the amplitude of the RF voltage supply should be relatively high in order for those ions to be efficiently transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A somewhat similar effect is observed when the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operated still in a non-fragmentation mode but with collision gas present as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The gas pressure was 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>mbar and the DC bias was 0.5 V and equal throughout the fragmentation cell i.e. no axial DC voltage gradient was maintained. However, whereas when no collision gas was present a transmission of approx. 20-30% was observed at low RF amplitudes for relatively high mass to charge ratio ions, when collision gas is present the transmission of relatively high mass to charge ratio ions drops to zero. It is generally observed that in order to observe comparable transmission higher RF voltage amplitudes are required when operating the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with collision gas present compared to when operating the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> without collision gas present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The effect of maintaining various DC voltage gradients across the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the transmission of ions having various mass to charge ratios is shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The pressure in the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>mbar. The ion tunnel segment closest the entrance aperture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was maintained at 0.5 V. The downstream quadrupole Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (MS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) was operated in a RF only (i.e. ion-guiding) mode. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows the transmission characteristics for ions having a mass to charge ratio of 117, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) for ions having a mass to charge ratio of 609, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) for ions having a mass to charge ratio of 1081, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) for ions having a mass to charge ratio of 2034. The transmission characteristics show that in order to efficiently transmit ions having relatively low mass to charge ratios (e.g. 117) the amplitude of the RF voltage should be relatively low whereas in order to efficiently transmit ions having relatively high mass to charge ratios (e.g. 2034) the amplitude of the RF voltage should be relatively high. It is apparent therefore than when MS/MS experiments are performed wherein both high and low mass to charge ratio ions must be transmitted, the amplitude of the RF voltage should ideally be set to some intermediate value. According to a preferred embodiment, the amplitude of the RF voltage is linearly ramped from 50 V<highlight><subscript>pp </subscript></highlight>for ions having a mass to charge ratio of 2 up to 320 V<highlight><subscript>pp </subscript></highlight>for ions having a mass to charge ratio of 1000, and for ions having a mass to charge ratio &gt;1000 the amplitude of the RF voltage is preferably maintained at 320 V<highlight><subscript>pp</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows the intensity of daughter ions having a mass to charge ratio of 173 produced by fragmenting a high mass cluster from NaRbCsI (having a mass to charge ratio of 2872) in a daughter ion MS/MS experiment as a function of the amplitude of the applied RF voltage with and without a 3V DC voltage difference being maintained along the length of the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This suggests that for MS/MS modes of operation, the amplitude of the RF voltage required for maximum transmission is closer to that of the higher mass to charge ratio parent ion than that of the lower mass to charge ratio daughter ion. Furthermore, it shows that the application of an axial DC voltage gradient improves the intensity of the signal compared with no axial DC voltage gradient. Similar results were obtained using PPG 3000 and also for lower mass parent ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> One of the reasons for applying a DC voltage gradient across the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is to decrease the transit time of ions travelling through the cell. The transit time was measured using an oscilloscope attached to the detector head amplifier set to trigger off a change in mass program. The time taken for the preferred fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to empty as a function of axial DC voltage gradient is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The empty time is reduced from about 150 ms with no applied DC voltage difference to about 400 &mgr;s for a DC voltage difference of 10V across the whole fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The pressure in the fragmentation cell was 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>mbar. A conventional hexapole fragmentation cell typically has a 30 ms empty time. It will therefore be appreciated that by applying an axial DC voltage gradient to an ion tunnel fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shorter exit times can be obtained compared with those inherent with using a conventional multipole collision cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> compares neutral loss spectra obtained using a hexapole fragmentation cell (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)) with a fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the preferred embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). The sample was S-desmethyl metabolite formed by human liver microsomal incubation of Rabeprazole for 60 minutes. As is apparent, the sensitivity has improved by a factor of approximately &times;10 when using the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> compares parent ion spectra obtained using a conventional hexapole fragmentation cell (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)) and a fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the preferred embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). The sample was a Sulphone metabolite formed by human liver microsomal incubation of Rabeprazole. The sensitivity has increased by a factor &times;10 and also the resolution has greatly improved from over 25 amu to unit base resolution. The ion tunnel fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the preferred embodiment therefore enables more sensitive and higher resolution mass spectra to be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, due to the increased resolution obtained using the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the preferred embodiment, extracted ion chromatograms can be obtained which are substantially free of misleading interference peaks. This significantly aids the identification of the metabolite peaks since spurious peaks are no longer (falsely) considered when seeking to identify the sample on the basis of the extended ion chromatograms. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows extracted ion chromatograms of Sulphone metabolite formed during microsomal incubation of Rabeprazole for 60 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows the results obtained with a conventional hexapole fragmentation cell, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows the results obtained using a fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the preferred embodiment. As can be seen from comparing the two figures, in addition to recognising a true peak at around 11 minutes, false interference peaks were also recorded at 9.67 minutes and 11.27 minutes when a conventional hexapole collision cell was used. However, the two erroneous peaks were a result of the relatively poor resolution which is inherent when using a conventional hexapole fragmentation cell, and advantageously the erroneous peaks are not observed in the ion chromatogram obtained using the fragmentation cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the preferred embodiment as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
