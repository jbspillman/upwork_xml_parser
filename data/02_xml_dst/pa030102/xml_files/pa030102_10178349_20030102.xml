<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the configuration of a laser apparatus used for a semiconductor device manufacturing process and other purposes. In particular, the invention relates to a laser apparatus used to improve or restore, by application of laser light, the crystallinity of a semiconductor material partially or fully made of an amorphous component, a substantially intrinsic, polycrystalline semiconductor material, or a semiconductor material whose crystallinity has been lowered being damaged by ion application, ion implantation, ion doping, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a laser illumination system used for a low-temperature process for producing TFTs that are used in a liquid crystal display device and, more specifically, to a technique for forming, on the same substrate, thin-film transistors having a large mobility disposed in a peripheral circuit area and a number of thin-film transistors having uniform characteristics disposed in association with respective pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A panel used in a process for manufacturing a liquid crystal display generally has a peripheral circuit area and a pixel area. The peripheral circuit area has a role of controlling the value of a current flowing through each pixel. As semiconductor devices in the peripheral circuit area have a larger mobility, the circuit configuration of the display can be made simpler and the display is allowed to operate at higher speed. On the other hand, pixels have a role of holding information sent from drivers. If semiconductor devices in the pixel area do not have a sufficiently small off-current, they cannot hold such information. Further, if off-current values are much different from one pixel to another, the pixels display differently the same information sent from the drivers. For the above reasons, a technique is now required which allows semiconductor devices having different characteristics to be selectively formed on the same substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In recent years, extensive studies have been made to decrease the temperature of semiconductor device manufacturing processes. This is largely due to the necessity of forming semiconductor devices on an insulative substrate made of glass or the like, which substrate is inexpensive and has high workability. In general, when a glass substrate is exposed to a high-temperature atmosphere of 600&deg; C. or more, it expands or is deformed, for instance. Therefore, it is now desired that the temperature of semiconductor device manufacturing processes be reduced as much as possible. The decrease of the process temperature is also required from miniaturization and multi-layering of devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In semiconductor device manufacturing processes, it is sometimes necessary to crystallize an amorphous component of a semiconductor material or an amorphous semiconductor material, to return to the original crystalline level the crystallinity of a semiconductor material which has been lowered by ion application, or to improve the crystallinity of an already crystalline semiconductor material. This is because if such materials are crystallized, the mobility of resulting semiconductor devices can be made very large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, thermal annealing is used for the above purpose. Where silicon is used as a semiconductor material, the crystallization of an amorphous material, the restoration of an original crystallinity level, the improvement of crystallinity, etc. are attained by performing thermal annealing at 600 to 1,100&deg; C. for at least several tens of hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In general, the processing time of such thermal annealing can be shortened as the temperature increases. On the other hand, almost no improvement is obtained at a temperature lower than 500&deg; C. Therefore, to decrease the process temperature, it is necessary to replace a conventional thermal annealing step with some other proper step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There is known, as one of the techniques for satisfying the above need are, a technique of performing various kinds of annealing by laser light illumination. Since laser light can supply high energy equivalent to that of thermal annealing to a desired, limited portion, this technique has an advantage that it is not necessary to expose the entire substrate to a high-temperature atmosphere. In general, there have been proposed two laser light illumination methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a first method, a CW laser such as an argon ion laser is used and a spot-like beam is applied to a semiconductor material. A semiconductor material is crystallized such that it is melted and then solidified soon due to a sloped energy profile of a beam and its movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a second method, a pulsed oscillation laser such as an excimer laser is used. A semiconductor material is crystallized such that it is instantaneously melted by application of a high-energy laser pulse and then solidified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The first method of using a CW laser has a problem of long processing time, because the maximum energy of the CW laser is insufficient and therefore the beam spot size is at most several millimeters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the second method using a pulse oscillation laser can provide high mass-productivity, because the maximum energy of the laser is very high and therefore the beam spot size can be made as large as several square centimeters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, to process a single, large-area substrate with an ordinary square or rectangular beam, the beam needs to be moved in the four orthogonal directions, which still remains to be solved from the viewpoint of mass-productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This aspect can be greatly improved by deforming a beam into a linear shape that is longer than the width of a subject substrate, and scanning the substrate with the beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The remaining problem is insufficient uniformity of laser light illumination effects. Pulsed oscillation lasers as represented by an excimer laser in which laser oscillation is obtained by gas discharge have a tendency that the energy somewhat varies from one pulse to another. Further, the degree of the energy variation also varies with the output energy. In particular, when illumination is performed in an energy range where stable laser oscillation cannot be obtained easily, it is difficult to perform laser processing with uniform energy over the entire substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another problem associated with the use of a pulsed oscillation laser is that the laser light energy decreases as the laser is used over a long time, which attributes to degradation of a gas necessary for laser oscillation. This does not appear to be a serious problem because the laser light energy can be increased by raising its operation level. However, in practice, raising the operation level is not preferable because once the operation level is changed, it takes some time for the laser light energy to be stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> By the way, it is conventionally very difficult to produce, only with laser light illumination, a crystalline silicon film having such a large mobility as enables fast operation of a liquid crystal display. In view of this, a method of improving the crystallinity after laser light illumination has been proposed in which thermal annealing for crystallization is performed at about 550&deg; C. for several hours before the laser light illumination. Although this method can attain a mobility (about 20 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs) as required for the pixel area and the off-current is small (about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12 </superscript></highlight>A) and has a small pixel-to-pixel variation (on the same order), it cannot provide a mobility (more than 100 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs) as required for the driver area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> We have already proposed the following method for solving this problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the first step, a metal element such as Ni is added to a semiconductor material that is deposited on a glass substrate. Various substances other than Ni can be used as long as they serve as nuclei when the semiconductor material is crystallized. However, according to our experiments, in the case where the semiconductor material is amorphous silicon, the addition of Ni effectively produced silicon films having the best crystallinity. The following description will be limited to the case where the impurity is Ni. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Among various methods of adding the impurity is a method of applying a nickel acetate salt solution to the surface of a semiconductor material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the second step, the Ni-added semiconductor material is kept at a high temperature. Where the semiconductor material is an amorphous silicon thin film, a crystalline silicon film is produced by keeping the Ni-added amorphous silicon thin film for 4 hours in an atmosphere of 550&deg; C. During this heat treatment step, Ni penetrates through the semiconductor material and crystal growth proceeds with Ni serving as nuclei. Thus, a crystalline film of the semiconductor material is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the third step, a film having better crystallinity is produced by applying laser light to the semiconductor material. The above-described linear laser light is used in this step. The laser light illumination is performed such that before application of strong pulsed laser light, preliminary illumination is conducted with weaker pulsed laser light. This allows formation of a semiconductor film having highly uniform crystallinity. The two-step illumination is effective in suppressing degradation of the uniformity of the film surface due to laser light illumination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The reason why the preliminary illumination is effective in obtaining a uniform film is that a crystalline silicon film obtained by the preceding steps still includes many amorphous portions in which the absorption factor of laser light energy is much different from that of a polycrystalline film. That is, the residual amorphous portions are crystallized by the first illumination, and the total crystallization is accelerated by the second illumination. The two-step illumination is very advantageous, and can greatly improve the characteristics of completed semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To reduce the degree of abrupt temperature change of a silicon film surface due to laser light illumination, it is preferred that during the laser light illumination a substrate be kept at 100 to 600&deg; C. It is known that in general an abrupt change in environmental conditions impairs the uniformity of a substance. By keeping the substrate temperature high, the degradation of the uniformity of a substrate surface due to laser light illumination can be minimized. No particular atmosphere control is performed; i.e., the illumination is performed in the air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The mobility of a crystalline film thus produced depends on the semiconductor material and the laser light energy. Where the semiconductor material is silicon, a crystalline silicon film having a mobility of more than 100 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs can be obtained. Although the mobility generally increases as the laser light energy is increased, it starts to decrease at a certain high energy level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Although thin-film transistors formed by using a crystalline silicon film produced by the above method have a high mobility, they have large off-current values that vary very much from one transistor to another (two to five orders) (The off-current variation becomes almost unnoticeable if the laser light energy is so reduced as to provide a mobility of 20 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs.) The variation of off-current values adversely affect the pixels, and causes point defects and line defects in a completed liquid crystal display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As described above, a pixel-to-pixel variation of the off-current in the pixel area causes fatal defects for the operation of a liquid crystal display. However, it has been proved that a variation of off-current values of thin-film transistors disposed in the peripheral circuit area does not have large influences on the operation of a liquid crystal display. It has also been proved that while a large mobility (larger than 100 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs) is required for the peripheral circuit area, a relatively small mobility (about 20 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs) is sufficient for the pixel area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Based on the above discussions, an appropriate laser light application scheme is such that high-energy laser light is applied to the peripheral circuit area and low-energy laser light is applied to the pixel area (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> However, the scheme of individually applying laser beams of different energies to the peripheral circuit area and the pixel area makes the laser light illumination step complex and time-consuming. For example, if the peripheral circuit area is illuminated while the pixel area is masked, and vice versa, this process takes long time and becomes complex because of two times of illumination. Further, if the above-described two-step illumination is employed, this scheme needs four times of illumination. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide, by solving the above problems, a laser illumination system which can perform illumination at constant laser energy even using a pulsed oscillation laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus which allows the above-described laser light illumination method to be performed in short time in a simple way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> To attain the above objects, the invention is characterized in that an energy attenuating device as represented by a light attenuation filter and an energy measuring device as represented by a beam profiler are used in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> That is, in the invention, a laser is oscillated at an output level at which the laser operates in as stable a state as possible. Further, by additionally using the energy attenuating device, the laser light intensity is adjusted to illuminate an object at an optimum energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the invention, it is preferred that the energy attenuation factor of the energy attenuating device be continuously variable. But it may be discretely variable. That is, the invention is summarized such that the laser light energy as output is set higher than the above-mentioned optimum energy and the laser light energy is adjusted to the optimum energy by using the energy attenuating device. In doing so, the laser is caused to operate in an energy range where it can oscillate in as stable a state as possible. As the laser continues to oscillate over a long time, the laser light energy tends to decrease. In the invention, this energy reduction is compensated by adjusting the energy attenuating device. That is, the invention is characterized by enabling laser light illumination to be always performed at a constant energy by attenuating, in the initial stage, the laser light energy by the energy attenuating device by an amount equal to the energy reduction in the final stage, and gradually reducing the attenuation factor as the laser light illumination proceeds. This is why it is preferred that the energy attenuating device is continuously variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a laser illumination apparatus producing a large-area beam spot is combined with a device (hereinafter called an energy attenuating device) capable of attenuating the energy of the large-area laser beam at different attenuation factors for respective portions of the beam. By virtue of using such an energy attenuating device, laser light illumination is conducted only once, which contributes to increase of the throughput. Even if the invention is combined with the above-described two-step illumination, illumination is conducted only two times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If the energy measuring device is added to the above system, the laser light energy can be controlled more precisely. In general, pulsed lasers such as an excimer laser has a tendency that a certain degree of variation occurs in the laser light energy even if the laser output is kept constant. This problem may be solved by, for instance, changing the laser output itself (operation level) in accordance with a variation of the laser light energy, or by changing the energy attenuation factor of the energy attenuating device. The former method is not appropriate in the case where the laser light energy needs to be controlled very precisely, because the laser oscillation itself becomes unstable when the laser output is changed. On the other hand, since the latter method does not change the laser output, the laser oscillation does not become unstable. Thus, the latter method is advantageous over the former method. However, the latter method needs to use the energy attenuating device having a variable energy attenuation factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The laser illumination system having the above configuration enables formation of a silicon film having regions of different electrical characteristics on the same substrate by changing the laser light illumination energy. Further, by using the above-described energy attenuating device, it becomes possible to perform laser processing with throughput equivalent to that as would be obtained when laser illumination is conducted without changing the laser light illumination energy. By forming a number of TFTs on the thus-produced silicon film, TFTs having a large mobility and TFTs having a small off-current can be formed on the same substrate. By using this technique, an active matrix liquid crystal display device can be constructed in which the peripheral circuit area is constituted of TFTs having a large mobility and the pixel area is constituted of TFTs having a small off-current.</paragraph>

An oscillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> emits KrF excimer laser light (wavelength: 248 nm; pulse width: 25 ns). Apparently other excimer lasers and other types of laser may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Laser light emitted from the oscillator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is reflected by full-reflection mirrors <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, amplified by an amplifier <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, reflected by full-reflection mirrors <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and introduced into an optics <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an energy attenuating device is inserted between the mirror <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the optics <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the configuration of the energy attenuating device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the energy attenuating device is of a type in which a single plate of filter faces a traveling laser beam and the energy transmission factor is changed by changing the angle formed by the beam and the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The laser beam immediately before entering the optics <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a rectangular shape of about 3&times;2 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. it is shaped by the optics <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> into a long and narrow (i.e., linear) beam having a length of 8 to 30 cm and a width of 0 to 0.5 mm. The laser light as output from the optics <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a maximum energy of 1,000 mJ/shot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The reason for shaping the laser light into the above long and narrow beam is to improve its processibility. After being output from the optics <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the linear beam is reflected by the full-reflection mirror <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and applied to a sample <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Since the beam is longer than the width of the sample <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the entire sample <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be illuminated with the laser beam by moving the sample <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in one direction. Therefore, the sample stage/driving device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be made simple in configuration and can be maintained easily. Further, the alignment operation in setting the sample <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The sample stage <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to which the laser beam is applied is controlled by a computer so as to move approximately perpendicularly to the linear laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an optical path in the optics <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A laser beam entering the optics <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> passes through a cylindrical concave lens A, a cylindrical convex lens B, and horizontal and vertical fly-eye lenses C and D, so that an original Gaussian profile is converted into a rectangular profile. Thereafter, the laser beam is passed through cylindrical convex lenses E and f, focused by a cylindrical lens H through a mirror G (corresponds to the mirror <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), and applied to the sample <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The mirror G (corresponds to the mirror <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is so constructed as to transmit a small part of the laser light energy. Therefore, by disposing a beam profiler behind the mirror G, the laser light energy can be measured even while the laser beam is applied to the sample <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, i.e., on a real-time basis. Since the linear laser beam has a large area, the energy is measured by moving the beam profiler within the linear laser beam to scan it (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). In this manner, even the energy profile of the linear laser beam can be measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The above apparatus is designed such that if the energy of the linear laser beam has deviated from a preset energy by a predetermined percentage during laser light illumination, a signal is automatically sent from a beam splitter to the energy attenuating device and the laser energy is returned to the preset energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Although the mirror G being partially transmissive provides the advantage of real-time measurement of the laser light illumination energy (first embodiment; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), it has a disadvantage that part of the laser energy is lost. This embodiment is directed to an apparatus for solving that problem. However, the apparatus of this embodiment cannot measure the energy of the linear laser beam on a real-time basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a laser light illuminating portion of the apparatus of this embodiment. A mirror P in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> corresponds to the mirror G in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The mirror P is a full-reflection mirror, and a 4%-reflection mirror Q is disposed under the mirror P. An energy component reflected by the mirror Q enters a beam profiler R. The mirror Q is smaller than the mirror P, because the beam profiler measures a small area each time. The mirror Q moves in link with the beam profiler R, and is adapted to slide over a range longer than the linear laser beam. During laser light illumination, the mirror Q and the beam profiler are slid outside the linear laser beam. If an object of illumination is shorter than the linear laser beam, the mirror Q may be placed at an end portion of the linear laser beam which portion does not affect the illumination, in which case the energy can be measured even during laser light illumination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 3 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> We have studied the method for improving the crystallinity of an amorphous or crystalline silicon or silicon compound film by illuminating it with laser light and, in particular, the manufacturing method of a film suitable as a material for a liquid crystal display device, and propose the following apparatus that facilitates manufacture of such a film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As in the first embodiment, this embodiment uses the laser annealing apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. An energy attenuating device is inserted into the output-side optical path of the optics <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the configuration of the energy attenuating device. A brief description will be made of the mechanism of this device. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the light attenuation factor of each of special light attenuation filters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is changed by changing the angle formed by the laser beam and the filter. The transmission factor of each of the light attenuation filters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is maximum when the filter is perpendicular to the laser beam, and is reduced as the angle decreases from 90&deg;. Although in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> the energy attenuating device consists of the two light attenuation filters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, there is no limitation on the number of light attenuation filters. Several light attenuation filters may be used in combination depending on the laser light illumination object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> schematically shows how the laser beam is applied, in which a mirror <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> corresponds to the mirror <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and a sample <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> corresponds to the sample <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A stage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> corresponds to the stage <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and can move in a direction indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A description will be made of an example of forming a crystalline silicon film on a glass substrate by laser light illumination by using the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> First, a glass substrate (for instance, Corning 7959) of 10 cm&times;10 cm is prepared. A 2,000-&angst;-thick silicon oxide film (not shown) is formed on the glass substrate by plasma CVD in which TEOS is used as a material. This silicon oxide film serves as a undercoat film for preventing impurities from diffusing into a semiconductor film from the glass substrate side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> An amorphous silicon film is then deposited by plasma CVD. Low-pressure thermal CVD may be used instead of plasma CVD. The thickness of the amorphous silicon film is set at 500 &angst;. Apparently this thickness may be set as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a silicon oxide film is formed on the surface of the amorphous silicon film by immersing the substrate in excessive water ammonia of 70&deg; C. for 5 minutes. A liquid-phase nickel acetate salt is then applied to the surface of the amorphous silicon film by spin coating. Nickel serves as an element for accelerating crystallization when the amorphous silicon film is crystallized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Although in this embodiment Ni is used as a metal element for accelerating crystallization of silicon, there may also be used one or a plurality of elements selected from Fe, Co,.Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, hydrogen is removed from the amorphous silicon film by keeping the substrate at 450&deg; C. for one hour in a nitrogen atmosphere. This is to intentionally form dangling bonds in the amorphous silicon film, to reduce the threshold energy of crystallization later performed. The amorphous silicon film is then crystallized by performing a heat treatment of 550&deg; C. and 4 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere. It is noted that the action of Ni has enabled the crystallization to be performed at a temperature as low as 550&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A crystalline silicon film can be formed on the glass substrate in the above manner. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a state that a glass substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> formed with a crystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is placed on a holder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In this state, a KrF excimer laser beam (wavelength: 248 nm; pulse width 25 ns) is applied to the crystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by using the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The crystallinity of the silicon film can be improved by this laser beam illumination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The laser beam is converted by beam shape conversion lenses into a rectangular shape to produce an illumination beam area of 125 mm&times;1 mm. The sample is mounted on the stage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and its entire surface is illuminated by moving the stage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> at a rate of 2 mm/s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As for the laser beam illumination conditions, two-step illumination consisting of preliminary illumination of 100 to 300 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and main illumination of 200 to 500 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is employed, and the pulse rate is set at 30 pulses/s. The two-step illumination is employed to minimize degradation of the uniformity of a film surface due to laser beam illumination, to thereby form a film having better crystallinity. The reason why the crystallinity is improved by this method has already been described in the background part of this specification. The laser beam energy is changed (for instance, from the preliminary illumination to the main illumination) by changing the energy attenuation factor of the energy attenuating device. This is conducted more easily than changing the output energy of the laser itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The substrate temperature is kept at 200&deg; C. during the laser beam illumination. This is to reduce the rate of increase and decrease of the temperature of the substrate surface due to the laser beam illumination. While in this embodiment the substrate temperature is set at 200&deg; C., in practice it is set at an optimum value for laser annealing in a range of 100&deg; C. to 600&deg; C. No particular atmosphere control is performed; that is, the illumination is conducted in the air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A specific laser beam illumination method will be described below, which can be used for either the first or second illumination of the two step-illumination scheme. The amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as the laser beam illumination object of this embodiment is one that has been formed for the purpose of producing a liquid crystal display, and is divided into a peripheral circuit area <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and a pixel matrix area <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by a broken line indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The laser beam illumination is conducted while changing the laser beam energy with the broken line as a boundary. The energy attenuating device consisting of the light attenuation filters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is used to change the laser beam energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As is understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the energy attenuating device can provide different energy attenuation factors for portions of the linear laser beam on both sides of an arbitrary position. Further, even during illumination with the linear laser beam, i.e., during laser beam scanning, the angles formed by the laser beam and the respective light attenuation filters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can be changed independently of each other, to enable illumination at different laser beam energies in a single laser beam scanning operation. By properly combining the above two features, laser processing of the above-mentioned energy distribution can be performed on the illumination object shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> by a single scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A specific illumination method is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. A linear laser beam <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> comes from the left side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, passes through the light attenuation filters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, reflected by the path-folding mirror <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and applied to the illumination surface of the amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The illumination object shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is divided into the peripheral circuit area <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the pixel matrix area <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> schematically shows the configuration of a liquid crystal panel having peripheral circuit areas and a pixel area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The stage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on which the glass substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> formed with the crystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is mounted is moved in a direction indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Incorporating a heater in its lower portion, the stage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> can kept the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at a desired temperature. A description will now be made of an example in which laser beams having energy densities of 300 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and 400 m/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>are respectively applied to the peripheral circuit forming area <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the pixel matrix forming area <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. This is done according to the following procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> First, the laser is oscillated with its output set at a value larger than 400 mj/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Then, the angles of the light attenuation filters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are adjusted so that they have different transmission factors (in this case, so that laser beams <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> have energy densities of 300 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and 400 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, respectively). Upon completion of this setting, the laser beams <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> start to be applied to the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from its left side. The stage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> moves to the left as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. At a time instant when the linear laser beam has just finished illumination of the pixel matrix area <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the angle of the light attenuation filter <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is changed to the same angle as the light attenuation filter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The illumination is continued thereafter. To perform the two-step illumination as described above, the above process may be conducted two times. ps Embodiment 4 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> A description will be made of a case of adding the energy measuring device to the method of the first embodiment. The energy measuring device may be located anywhere as long as the energy of a laser beam passed through the energy attenuating device can be measured. This embodiment is directed to a case where the energy measuring device is located at a position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. When a difference between an energy measured by the energy measuring device and a preset energy exceeds a predetermined value, a signal is sent from the energy measuring device to the energy attenuating device, which, in response, changes the energy attenuation factor. Thus, the laser beam energy can be returned to the preset value. This system enables more precise energy control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The energy measuring device may be added to the optics shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> such that the path-folding mirror <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is made partially transmissive and the energy measuring device is disposed on an optical path <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on the transmission side of the path-folding mirror <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In this case, a several percentage of each of the laser beams <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> passes through the path-folding mirror <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and travels along the optical path <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to reach the energy measuring device, which measures energies of the laser beams <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Based on measured energy values, the angles of the light attenuation filters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The laser beam illumination technique of the invention has made it possible to perform laser processing while minimizing a variation of the laser beam energy. As a result, it is expected that the reproducibility of a laser processing step is improved, and that variations in the characteristics of products that are produced by a manufacturing process including a laser processing step are thereby reduced very much. In particular, the invention can effectively be applied to all the laser processing steps used in semiconductor device manufacturing processes, because such steps tolerate only a small laser beam energy range; that is, a slight difference in energy causes great influences on the characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The laser illumination system of the invention makes it possible to greatly change the characteristics of a part of a film to constitute semiconductor devices. The invention can be applied to all the laser processing steps used in semiconductor device manufacturing processes. In particular, in the case of semiconductor devices are TFTs for a liquid crystal panel, it becomes possible to produce TFTs for driver devices having a mobility larger than 100 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs and TFTs for pixels having a small pixel-to-pixel variation in the characteristics, particularly off-currents of the pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As a result, it becomes possible to increase the movement speed of images of a TFT liquid crystal display device produced by a low-temperature manufacturing process, and to decrease the rate of occurrence of defective substrates having point defects, line defects, or other defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As such, the invention is very useful from the industrial point of view. </paragraph>
