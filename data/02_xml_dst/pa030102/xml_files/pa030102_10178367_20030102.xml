<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to display boards used for mounting photographs, prints, crafts, documents, projects, and other items. More specifically, this invention relates to such a board which is pre-coated with a pressure-sensitive adhesive. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is often desired to mount a print or the like in a central position on a larger mat board. This allows the border to be used in handling the work and in marking the mat without affecting the print. More importantly, the centering enhances the presentation by creating a frame around the print. At present this is done in a series of separate steps and requires careful measurement and alignment of the print in the center of the board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Under the present invention a mat is provided that has a central adhesive coated area inward from the periphery on all sides. The area may be sized to accommodate precisely the precise dimension of popular photo prints, i.e., 5&times;7, 8&times;10, etc. The area, before mounting of the print, is covered by a peel sheet and for further enhancement the central area is defined by a depressed margin line imparted by a &ldquo;kiss cut&rdquo; of a steel rule die. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention is a display board having a perimeter and adapted to mount a sheet bearing artwork, the board having a central area, the boundaries of which are spaced on all sides inward from the perimeter, and a layer of adhesive in the central area. The central area and adhesive is covered by a protective layer removably adhered to the area by the adhesive. The area may be defined by a depressed line in the board.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A display board embodying the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and generally designated A. It comprises a mat board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a central area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> covered with adhesive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The central area is preferably defined by a depressed continuous line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> surrounding that area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A cover sheet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of silicon or the like covers the central area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the adhesive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>adhered thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In use, once the protective layer (i.e. the silicon sheet) is removed, the artwork, print, etc. of the size for the selected board, is pressed against the adhesive-coated surface. Then, the user can handle the mounted print or display it in any manner he chooses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention uses standard existing display boards such as mat boards, foam boards and other items which can used with easels, frames, magnets as is typically found in graphic display. The use of adhesives is common to insure that prints are kept in place and flat on the board. This is important for viewing and the aesthetic presentation. These components are commonly found in products which display photographs, artwork, presentations and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The coating of adhesive and print only in the interior of the board accomplishes the &ldquo;framed look&rdquo; without any complicated steps or items required. It also insures the intended placement of the print, such as in the center of the board, without the need for extra steps to calculate such placement. It also allows the edges of the board to be used for other purposes including identifying markings and titles, shapes to resemble items related to the print displayed (such as the board may be cut in the shape of a ball to display a sports theme). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> To accomplish this, the adhesive must be placed by design on the board where intended. This can be done by methods such as screen-printing the adhesive on the boards. Any protective paper over the adhesive must be similarly designed and overlaid in the same position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The adhesive must have enough viscosity such that a sufficient amount of the adhesive lies on top of the board and can bond to the print. The degree of viscosity, porosity of the display board and the thickness of the coating must be determined for each type of board. The thickness of the coating can be precisely determined by the design of the screens through which the adhesive is coated onto the board. The screen also positions the adhesive precisely on the board being coated. The adhesive must be porous enough to fit through the screen and thick enough not to soak through the board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Variations in the invention are contemplated. While the invention has been disclosed in only one embodiment, it is not so limited but is of a scope defined by the following claim language which may be broadened by an extension of the right to exclude others from making, using or selling the invention as is appropriate under the doctrine of equivalents. </paragraph>
