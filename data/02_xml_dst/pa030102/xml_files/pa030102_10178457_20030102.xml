<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. P2001-38298 filed in Korea on Jun. 29, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an organic electro-luminescence device, and more particularly, to an electro-luminescence device, having data lines, gate lines and voltage supplying lines formed from materials that are different from each other and corresponding to each function, and capable of enhancing its characteristics, and to a method of fabricating the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recently, there has been an increased requirement for a flat panel display device having a small possessory space independent of an enlarged display device. An electro-luminescence device is at the forefront of the flat panel display devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The electro-luminescence device is divided into an inorganic electro-luminescence device and an organic electro-luminescence device in accordance with the material used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The inorganic electro-luminescence device conventionally applies a high electrical field to a light-emitting portion in order to emit light. The high electrical field accelerates electrons and allows the accelerated electrons to be impacted, thereby exciting a light emitting center. During excitation of the light emitting center, the inorganic electro-luminescence device emits the light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The organic electro-luminescence device injects electrons from a cathode and holes from an anode into a light-emitting portion to transfer excitons from an exciting status to a base status, thereby emitting light. The electron and holes, which are injected into the light-emitting portion are combined to form the exciton. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The inorganic electro-luminescence device having the operation principle as described above requires a high voltage of 100 to 200 volts as a driving voltage because of the application of the high electric field to the light-emitting portion. The organic electro-luminescence device has an advantage that it is driven by a low voltage of about 5 to 20 volts. In light of this point, the organic electro-luminescence device is actively developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Also, the organic electro-luminescence device is used for a picture element (or a pixel) of a graphic display, a television image display or a surface light source, owing to its characteristics of wide viewing angle, high-speed response and high contrast. Furthermore, since the organic electro-luminescence device is thin and light and provides a high chrominance, it is adapted for a next generation flat panel display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an organic electro-luminescence device including gate lines GL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through GLm and data lines DL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to DLn arranged to cross each other on a glass substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and picture elements PE arranged at each crossing of the gate lines GL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to GLm and the data line DL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through DLn . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When a gate line on the gate line GL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to GLm is enabled, each picture element PE is driven to generate light corresponding to a video signal on the data line DL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to drive the electro-luminescence device, a gate driver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to the gate lines GL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to GLm and a data driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to the data lines DL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through DLn. The gate line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sequentially drives the gate line GL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through GLm. The data driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> applies video signals to the picture elements PE through the data lines DL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to DLn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The picture elements PE driven by the gate driver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the data driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> each include an electro-luminescence cell OLED connected to a ground voltage line GND and a cell driving circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for driving the electro-luminescence cell OLED, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The cell driving circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected between the electro-luminescence cell OLED and the ground voltage line GND. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the cell driving circuit includes a second PMOS TFT (P-channel Metal Oxide Thin Film Transistor) T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected between the electro-luminescence cell OLED and a supply voltage line VDD to drive the electro-luminescence cell OLED, and a first PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected between the data line DL and a gate electrode of the second PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to switch the picture signal to be applied to the gate electrode of the second PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a capacitor Cst connected between a drain electrode of the PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the supply voltage line VDD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In explaining an operation of the cell driving circuit in association with a driving waveform diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the first PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned-on when a low input signal, i.e., a scanning signal from the gate driver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is applied to the gate line GL. If the first PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned-on, a video signal received synchronously with the scanning signal from the data line DL flows through the first PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is charged into the capacitor Cst. The video signal has a predetermined amplitude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The capacitor Cst connected between the drain electrode of the first PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the supply voltage line VDD charges the video signal applied from the data line DL while the low input signal is supplied to the gate line GL. The capacitor Cst holds the video signal, which is applied from the data line and charged thereinto, during one frame. The holding operation of the capacitor Cst enables the application of the video signal from the data line DL to the electro luminescence device OLED to be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An organic electro-luminescence device having such a configuration of the picture element PE requires a number of data lines adapted for receiving each image signal such as R(Red), G(Green), B(Blue), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram showing another configuration of the conventional picture element PE. The picture element PE of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> includes an electro luminescence cell OLED connected to a ground voltage line GND and a cell driving circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> positioned at a crossing of a data line DL and a gate line GL. The cell driving circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected between the electro luminescence cell OLED and the data line DL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The cell driving circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a third and fourth PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> forming a current mirror between the electro luminescence cell OLED and a supply voltage line VDD; a fifth PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> connected between the data line DL and the gate line GL to respond to a signal on the gate line GL; a sixth PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> connected between nodes of gate electrodes of the third and fourth PMOS TFTs T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the gate line GL and the fifth PMOS TFT T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>; and a capacitor Cst connected between the node of gate electrodes of the third and fourth PMOS TFTs T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the supply voltage line VDD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> explains an operation of the picture element shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The fifth and sixth PMOS TFTs T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are turned-on if a low input signal is applied to the gate line GL. When the fifth and sixth PMOS TFTs T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are turned-on, a video signal received synchronously with the scanning signal from the data line DL is charged into the capacitor Cst through the fifth and sixth PMOS TFTs T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The video signal has a predetermined amplitude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The capacitor Cst between the node of the gate electrodes of the third and fourth PMOS TFTs T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> charges the video signal from the data line DL while the low input signal is applied to the gate line GL. The capacitor Cst holds the video signal, which is applied from the data line DL and charged thereinto, during one frame. The holding of the capacitor Cst allows the application of the video signal from the data line DL to the electro luminescence cell OLED to be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An organic electro-luminescence device having such a configuration of the picture element PE requires a number of data lines adapted for receiving each image signal such as R(Red), G(Green), B(Blue), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The video signal, which is charged into the capacitor Cst and held during one frame, is applied to the electro luminescence cell OLED so that an image (or a picture) is displayed on a display panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a plan view showing the construction of the gate line and the data line of the organic electro-luminescence device in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference> crossing each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there are data lines DL and supply voltage lines VDD arranged alternatively in the horizontal direction and gate lines GL arranged in the vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the case of an organic electro-luminescence device of a VGA mode having picture elements of 640&times;480, the gate lines GL of 480 columns are formed in the vertical direction. The data line and the supply voltage line VDD are alternatively formed in the horizontal direction of 640 rows, for displaying a mono picture. For a color picture, lines of 3840&equals;640&times;3&times;2 are formed in the horizontal direction because of the requirement of having the data lines and the supply voltage lines for each R, G and B picture element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As described above, since a density of the lines in the horizontal direction is higher than that of lines in the vertical direction as the number of lines in the horizontal direction is more than those in the vertical direction, there is a disadvantage that a stress increases in the horizontal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The organic electro-luminescence device also radiates heat during the emission of light, thereby being continuously heated at about 70&deg; C. Due to this, the breaking of wires at the crossings between the wires (or the crossings between the lines) is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A through 6D</cross-reference> explains a step-by-step method of fabricating a gate line, a data line and a supply voltage line of a conventional organic electro-luminescence device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A, a</cross-reference> metal layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is first deposited on a substrate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in order to form each line of the organic electro-luminescence device. The metal layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed from a conductive material such as aluminum or an alloy of aluminum by a sputtering process, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> On the metal layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. The photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is produced by a process of uniformly coating a photo resist on the metal layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to a desired thickness, exposing the photo resist to ultraviolet rays using a photo mask (not shown) arranged thereon, and developing the exposed photo resist by a developing solution. At this time, the exposed photo resist is subjected to ultraviolet rays, which changes the molecular structure so that it is dissolved into a material soluble by the developing solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The metal layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> exposed by the photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is etched using an etching process, such as a wet etching, using the photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as an etching mask. The metal <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has a pattern the same as the photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>. In the case where the metal layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is etched by a wet etching, an etchant such as an aqueous solution of (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>is used, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on the metal layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which is not etched, is removed by stripping equipment after the etching process, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In such a conventional electro-luminescence device, a liner expansion in the wiring is enlarged by the heat because aluminum or an alloy of aluminum having a low resistance is used to deposit the metal layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Due to this, the conventional electro-luminescence device has a disadvantage that the breaking of wiring is increased. The conventional electro-luminescence device also has another disadvantage that a crossing of two wires is broken by a chemical reaction with an etchant used to etch one of the wirings, because various wirings are formed from the same material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing a structure of an organic electro-luminescence device according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the organic electro-luminescence device includes an active layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a gate insulating film (unlabeled) and a gate electrode <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> disposed sequentially between an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> a buffer insulating film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> on the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; a source electrode <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a drain electrode <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> formed to be electrically connected to the active layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through a contact hole (unlabeled) on the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>; and a data electrode (not shown) formed simultaneously with the source and drain electrodes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The organic electro-luminescence device further includes a protective film <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> formed on the source and drain electrodes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. On the protective layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, there is formed a transparent electrode <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is connected to the source electrode <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> through another contact hole (unlabeled). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8D</cross-reference> explain step-by-step a process of forming a gate line, a data line and a supply voltage line of an organic electro-luminescence device according to the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A, a</cross-reference> metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is deposited on a substrate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in order to fabricate each line. The metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is formed from a conductive material of high melting point such as chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), etc., through a sputtering method, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The type of metal used for metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> depends on the kind of line to be formed by it. In the case where the metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is used as the gate line, the material forming the metal layer must be determined in consideration of the thermal stability with forming polysilicon. Therefore, the metal layer for the gate line is formed from a heat resisting material being high in thermal stability. The metal layer forming the supply voltage line must have a low resistance. In light of this point, the metal layer for the supply voltage line has a double structure of aluminum (Al) and a heat resisting material, or is formed from aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) or an alloy of aluminum (Al). The metal layer for the data line is formed from a material different from those of the gate line and the supply voltage line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> On the deposited metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, there is formed a photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. The photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is produced by a process of uniformly coating a photo resist on the metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to a desired thickness, exposing the photo resist to ultraviolet rays using a photo mask (not shown) arranged thereon, and developing the exposed photo resist by a developing solution. At this time, the exposed photo resist is subjected to the ultraviolet rays, which changes the molecular structure so that it is dissolved into a material soluble by the developing solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> exposed by the photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is etched using an etching process, such as a wet etching, using the photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as an etching mask. The metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a pattern the same as the photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>. In the case where the metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is etched by a wet etching, an etchant such as an aqueous solution of (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>is used, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on the metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which is not etched, is removed by stripping equipment after the etching process, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</cross-reference>. In detail, the substrate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is washed for removing an alien material before the photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is removed therefrom by a stripper solution sprayed from a nozzle. Spraying of an IPA solution neutralizes the stripper solution on the substrate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The stripper and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solutions are washed off the substrate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> by deionized water (DI) sprayed at a constant pressure. The substrate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is spin-dried in a spin dry system to remove the DI therefrom. To this end, the photo resist pattern <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on the metal layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is removed from the substrate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A material having a high melting point such as chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), etc., which is used in the process of forming each line, has a high combining energy itself. Therefore, a material having a high melting point such as chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), etc. has a high tolerance for stress produced by the heat. However, a thin film has a variation in stress according to the film forming condition. Due to this, the film obtained based upon its forming condition must be used for a wiring having a stress of below 10 Mpa. Also, since the conductive layers of each line are formed from a material different from each other, a defect in the process where the same wiring is broken by the etchant used to etch the pattern formed is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As described above, the organic electro-luminescence device according to the present invention allows metal materials of high melting points for forming the gate line, the data line and the supply voltage line to be different from each other. Accordingly, the organic electro-luminescence device reduces defects that can be generated at the wiring formation. As a result, the organic electro-luminescence device can be highly productive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the electro-luminescence device of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
