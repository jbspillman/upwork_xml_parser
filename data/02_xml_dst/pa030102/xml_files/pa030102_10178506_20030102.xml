<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention concerns a recognition device, a bonding device, and a circuit device manufacturing method, and in particular concerns the improvement of the precision of recognition by a recognition device, the improvement of the precision of bonding by a bonding device, and a circuit device manufacturing method that uses such a recognition device and bonding device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Priorly with semiconductor devices, wire bonding to mounting parts formed on a lead frame was performed according to each mounting part, and as an embodiment therefor, a recognition device and bonding device for such wire bonding is disclosed for example in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Sho-63-29535. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> transistor lead frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to which a chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached, is set on a heating block part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A bonding arm <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is disposed above lead frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on heating block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a capillary <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is disposed at the tip of bonding arm <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A wire <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is disposed in this capillary <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a torch <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, for forming a ball from wire <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, is disposed near capillary <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This thermocompression type bonding device is provided with a wire bonding position recognition part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a bonding head driving part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as well as with a local heating device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which is set to operate in linkage with the operation of bonding head driving part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the X and Y directions and is for heating the bonding part locally. A laser beam device may for example be used as this local heating device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The operations shall now be described. Bonding head driving part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is made to move, as programmed in advance in accordance with information from wire bonding position recognition part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, to lead frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that has been heated by heating block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, local heating device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is made to operate just during the bonding process to perform ball bonding while compensating for inadequate heat on chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, capillary <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is thereafter moved to the lead frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side, local heating device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is made to operate again just during the bonding process to perform stitch bonding while compensating for inadequate heat at the lead frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side, and then torch <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is made to form a ball part at the tip of a wire <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that has been cut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Ball bonding is then performed on the other electrode of chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while making local heating device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> operate just during bonding to compensate for inadequate heat at chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, capillary <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is thereafter moved to the lead frame side, local heating device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is made to operate again just during the bonding process to perform stitch bonding while compensating for inadequate heat at the lead frame side, and then torch <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is made to form a ball part at the tip of a wire <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that has been cut. Since bonding is thus performed while compensating for inadequate heat at the bonding part, a high quality wire bond is obtained. A wire bond of even higher quality can be obtained by using ultrasonic waves in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also though the case of a transistor chip was described with the above-described embodiment, this invention is not limited thereto and the chip may be a diode, IC, etc., and the invention can thus be applied as a wire bonder for any semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Object(s) of the Invention&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the case where mounting parts are formed on a completely punched lead frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as has been described above, just the mounting parts need to be heated, for example, to approximately 250&deg; C. during wire bonding. That is, since the entirety of lead frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not constantly in a high temperature state and wire bonding could be performed by partial heating, there are no problems of erroneous recognition, degradation of recognition conditions, etc., with the bonding device and recognition device in the above-described example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Though details shall be given with the description of an embodiment of the present invention, in the case where a cluster block, having a plurality of mounting parts within a small area, is formed on a conductive foil, lead frame, etc., the conductive foil or lead frame, etc., will be kept at a high temperature state until all of the wire bonding processes for a single cluster block has been completed. There was thus the problem that the conductive foil or lead frame, etc., with the cluster block becomes oxidized due to being placed in the abovementioned high temperature state over a long period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The abovementioned oxidation of the lead frame, etc., may be prevented by placing the lead frame in the high temperature state in a space filled with an inert gas, such as nitrogen gas. However, in order to form this space, an inert-gas-filled space must be formed above the working base on which the lead frame is set and furthermore, a working hole for recognition and wire bonding must be formed above this space. In this case, the inert gas becomes heated to a high temperature within the space and, in the process of escaping to the exterior from the working hole, gives rise to a fluctuation (shimmer) due to the temperature difference with room temperature. This fluctuation invades the recognition region and causes erroneous recognition by the recognition camera, thus leading to lack of precision of recognition of highly integrated, fine, conductive patterns. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferably with the circuit device manufacturing method of this invention, a part of the abovementioned cover is formed of a clamper. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> This invention&apos;s recognition device comprising: a substrate setting base, having a heating function; a cover, which covers a working region from above the abovementioned substrate setting base; a working hole, provided in the upper surface of the abovementioned cover; an illumination, disposed above the abovementioned working hole; and a pattern recognition camera, disposed inside a lens barrel provided above the abovementioned illumination. When an inert gas, which is fed inside the abovementioned cover, is heated by the abovementioned substrate setting base and blows out to the exterior from the abovementioned working hole, fluctuation arises due to the temperature difference and this fluctuation stagnates within and in the surroundings of the abovementioned illumination. However, this invention&apos;s recognition device is provided with a shimmer prevention device, which is disposed between the lower part of the abovementioned illumination and the abovementioned working hole and near the abovementioned working hole, and the abovementioned fluctuation is made to escape in the horizontal direction with respect to the abovementioned cover surface by a blow current from the abovementioned shimmer prevention blow mechanism, thereby enabling the recognition precision of the abovementioned pattern recognition camera to be improved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the main structure of bonding device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprises a setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which covers a working space from above setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is provided in the upper surface of cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which is disposed above working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a bonding arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which is disposed at the side face of ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a capillary <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which is disposed at the tip part of bonding arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a torch <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is provided near capillary <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a lens barrel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which is disposed above ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a recognition camera, which, though not illustrated, is installed inside lens barrel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and a shimmer prevention blowing mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which characterizes this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The characteristics of the individual structures shall now be described along with their operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> First, on setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is set a lead frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which has a plurality of mounting parts, and setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is provided with a heater <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> function for heating lead frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and thereby improving the wire bonding property. By means of this heater <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the interior of a working space arranged by setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, can be kept at a high temperature state of, for example, approximately 230&deg; C. during the wire bonding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Also, though not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> part of cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed of a damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), and this cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is arranged by putting a lid on the upper face of damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for example by means of a stainless steel plate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). And, for example, nitrogen gas is blown as an inert gas at a rate of 4 liters/minute into cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This blow-in rate can be varied according to the working application. Working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided in the upper surface of cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed to a size, for example, of 5 mm&times;32 mm and pattern recognition and wire bonding are performed via this working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the wire bonding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and lens barrel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> shall now be described. Lens barrel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is disposed above ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Lead frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which are illuminated by ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> via working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, can be recognized by differences in reflectivity. By recognizing this reflected light by means of the recognition camera disposed inside lens barrel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, pattern recognition of the upper side of lead frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be performed. Here, by using ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as the illumination, lead frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can be illuminated without bias and without giving rise to shadows, thereby enabling pattern recognition to be performed more precisely. Also, thought not illustrated, lens barrel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is bent in the middle at an angle of 90 degrees with respect to the surface of setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the recognition camera is installed beyond this bent part. A mirror is installed an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> surface at this bent part, and pattern recognition can be performed by this structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Here, on lead frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, for example, 10 rows and 5 columns of mounting parts make up a single cluster block, and a plurality of such cluster blocks are formed. The size of working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is such that enables, for example, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> mounting parts of 2 rows of a single cluster block to be recognized from above. As shall be described later, this working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is used for pattern recognition, etc. The size of this working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is not defined in particular but is determined according to the working application and based on the recognition pattern method, etc., of bonding device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Bonding arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, capillary <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and torch <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> shall now be described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, after pattern recognition, ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, bonding arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and capillary <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> move and capillary <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is positioned above working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Wire bonding is then performed based on the data obtained by the recognition camera, and capillary <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> enters into cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to perform wire bonding of the electrode pads of semiconductor elements to the desired electrode patterns. In this process, torch <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> performs stitch bonding and forms a ball at the tip of a thin metal wire that has been cut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Lastly, the blow device, which characterizes this invention shall be described using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is, a schematic view of bonding device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which is provided with a recognition device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference>, shimmer prevention blow mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed between ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and near working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. And from shimmer prevention blow mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, for example, a nitrogen gas blow <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of 3 liters/minute is blown over working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the horizontal direction with respect to the surface of cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, as has been mentioned above, for example, nitrogen gas is blown at a rate of 4 liters/minute into cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the interior of cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is kept at a temperature for example of 230&deg; C. by heater <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> built into setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Though the temperature of the nitrogen gas that is fed in thereafter is, for example, 70&deg; C., it is heated to 230&deg; C. by the heat from heater <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Though the heated nitrogen gas flows out to the exterior from working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, since the room temperature at this time is, for example, 20&deg; C., shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is substantially that of the nitrogen gas, is caused by the temperature difference between the nitrogen gas and room temperature. As a result, shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> stays below ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and at the inner side of ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, causing the recognition precision of the recognition camera to degrade and the wire bonding precision to fall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the shimmer prevention blow mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of this invention is disposed immediately to the side of the lower end of ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and moves along with ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Shimmer prevention blow mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can blow away shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from above working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the surroundings of illumination ring <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by means of blow <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of, for example, nitrogen gas of 3 liters/minute. Here, since shimmer prevention blow mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed immediately to the side of the lower end of ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as has been mentioned above, the air and especially the oxygen in the working room will not become mixed into nitrogen gas <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Thus although the nitrogen gas <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> from shimmer prevention blow mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may enter inside cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the oxidation of lead frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> will not be promoted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that would stay below ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, at the inner side of ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and inside lens barrel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can thus be eliminated in advance by shimmer prevention blow mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Thus with this invention&apos;s bonding device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> provided with recognition device, even if a lead frame is set on the setting base for a long time, nitrogen gas can be filled during the wire bonding process to prevent oxidation in cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Since the surface of lead frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> will therefore not become oxidized, the reflectivity will be good in the process of pattern recognition and the recognition precision can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, though when the lead frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> surface becomes oxidized, an antioxidant film that can accommodate for temperatures up to 150&deg; C., for example, can become peeled and make the adhesiveness with resin poor, this problem can also be resolved. The bonding device will thus be one by which anti-moisture property and anti-peeling property can also be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is caused by the temperature difference with room temperature when the nitrogen gas that has been heated inside the cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> flows to the exterior via working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, can be eliminated by the shimmer prevention blow mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> that is disposed at the above-described position. Shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will thus not enter into the inner side of ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, enabling pattern recognition to be carried out at a high precision of the &mgr;m order by the recognition camera and wire bonding to be carried out at high precision as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Though wire bonding was described in detail with the present embodiment, equivalent effects can also be provided in die bonding, etc., using an optical recognition device. Also, the object set on the setting base is not limited to a lead frame, and equivalent effects can be obtained for any object with which the oxidation of conductive foil, etc., which shall be described below, needs to be prevented. Applications to devices that are provided with optical recognition devices and are used for the die bonding, wire bonding, or partial coating of soldered parts of metal substrates, printed substrates, ceramic substrates, etc., are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Also, though the case where a blow <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of, for example, nitrogen gas of 3 liters/minute is blown out from shimmer prevention blow mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> was described, the amount of blow <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is preferably set, in consideration of costs, to the minimum necessary rate by which shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be blown away. The amount of blow <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> shall thus be adjustable appropriately in accordance with the working conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The circuit device manufacturing method of this invention shall now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in the first step of this invention, a conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is prepared and conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which comprise at least a plurality of mounting parts for circuit elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, are formed by forming isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, each of which is shallower than the thickness of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, by etching conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in regions besides regions of conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In this process, first, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(A), a sheet-form conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is prepared. The material of this conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is selected in consideration of the attachment of the soldering material, bonding properties, and plating properties, and in terms of material, a conductive foil having Cu as the main material, a conductive foil having Al as the main material, or a conductive foil comprising an alloy, such as Fe&mdash;Ni, etc., is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In consideration of subsequent etching, the thickness of the conductive foil is preferably approximately 10 &mgr;m to 300 &mgr;m, and with the present embodiment a 70 &mgr;m (2 ounce) copper foil was employed. However basically, a foil with a thickness of 300 &mgr;m or more or 10 &mgr;m or less may also be used. As shall be described later, it is sufficient that isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which are shallower than the thickness of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The sheet-form conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that is prepared may be wound in the form of a roll of a predetermined width, for example, 45 mm and this may be conveyed to the respective processes to be described below, or strip-form conductive foils <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which have been cut to predetermined sizes, may be prepared and conveyed to the respective processes to be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(B), a plurality (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the present case) of blocks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, on each of which a plurality of mounting parts are to be formed, are aligned in a separated manner along a strip-form conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Slits <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are provided between the respective blocks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for absorption of the stress placed on conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as a result of heat treatment in the molding process, etc. Furthermore, index holes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are provided at fixed intervals at both sides of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for the purpose of positioning in the respective processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, conductive patterns are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A photoresist (anti-etching mask) PR is formed on Cu foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and photoresist PR is patterned so that conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will be exposed at regions besides regions that are to become conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is then etched selectively via photoresist PR as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In this process, in order to etch and thereby form isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> uniformly and at high precision in terms of depth, the open parts of isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are faced downwards and etching solution is showered upwards from etching solution supply pipe <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> disposed below conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(A). As a result, since the portions of isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that come in contact with the etching solution become etched and the etching solution is discharged immediately without staying inside the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the depth of isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be controlled by the duration of etching treatment and isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that are uniform and high in precision can be formed. Ferric chloride or cupric chloride is mainly employed in the etching solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(B) shows specific conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. This Figure corresponds to being an enlarged view of one of the blocks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(B). The part indicated by the dotted lines is a single mounting part <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that makes up conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a plurality of mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are aligned in matrix form in 5 rows and 10 columns in a single block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and the same conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are provided in each mounting part <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. A frame-like pattern <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is provided at the periphery of each block and positioning marks <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> for the dicing process are provided slightly separated from and to the inner side of frame-like pattern <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The frame-like pattern <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is used for fitting with a molding die and after etching of the rear face of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, serves the function of reinforcing an insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Next in the second step of this invention, circuit elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are affixed to the respective mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> with the desired conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Examples of circuit elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> include transistors, diodes, IC chips and other semiconductor elements and chip capacitors, chip resistors, and other passive elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Here, a bare transistor chip <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A is die bonded to a conductive pattern <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>A and a chip capacitor or passive element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B is affixed by solder or other soldering material or conductive paste <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Next, in the third step, which characterizes this invention&apos;s circuit device, electrodes of circuit elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the respective mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are wire bonded to the desired conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In this step, wire bonding is performed using the bonding device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> provided with recognition device that was shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(A), damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is disposed above setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of bonding device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the peripheral edges of block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are pressed by means of damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to bring conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into close contact with a heating block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on the surface of setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Pattern recognition of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, fixed on heat block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, is then performed via working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and by means of the recognition camera inside lens barrel <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. After pattern recognition, thermocompression ball bonding and ultrasonic wedge bonding of the emitter electrodes of the respective mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> inside block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to conductive pattern <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>B and the base electrodes to conductive pattern <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>B are performed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Here, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(A), damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has an opening <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of substantially the same size as block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and is provided with protruding and recessed parts <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> at parts that contact conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. By holding down the peripheral edges of block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by means of protruding and recessed parts <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the rear surface of block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is put into close contact with heating block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The interior of damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided with paths <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for the flow of nitrogen gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(B), cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed of a damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a stainless steel plate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. This plate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is fitted inside recessed parts <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> at the upper part of the damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and is free to move in a direction that is horizontal with respect to the surface of damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and perpendicular to the direction to the direction of movement of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed in plate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, and pattern recognition and wire bonding are performed on block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by this working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> moving in correspondence to the mounting parts in the row direction on copper foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Since a plurality of mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> exist within block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and wire bonding is performed in a batch according to each block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the present step, the duration for which block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is heated will be longer in comparison to that of the prior-art circuit device manufacturing method, and oxidation of block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may thus occur. In order to resolve this problem, damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided as a part of cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of bonding device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, nitrogen gas is blown onto the surface of block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from damper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and, at the same time, the interior of cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is filled with nitrogen gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the interior of the cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is maintained for example at 230&deg; C. by the function of heater <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that is built into setting base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the fed-in nitrogen gas is fed in for example at a temperature of 70&deg; C. The nitrogen gas is then heated to 230&deg; C. inside cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by heater <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The nitrogen gas is blown into cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for example at a rate of 4 liters/minute and flows out from working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> upon being heated. Since the temperature of the nitrogen gas is 230&deg; C. at this time and since the room temperature is, for example, 20&deg; C., a shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that flows out from working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed by this temperature difference. The pattern recognition precision is degraded by the outflowing shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> stagnating at the inner and outer sides of ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> However, with bonding device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of this invention, shimmer prevention blow mechanism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed at a part near working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and between ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and to be more specific, at a part immediately to the side of the lower end of ring illumination <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be blown away from above the working hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the surroundings of illumination ring <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by a nitrogen gas blow <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of, for example, 3 liters/minute. Since shimmer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is thus prevented from entering into the inner side of illumination ring <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, pattern recognition by the recognition camera can be performed at a high precision of the &mgr;m order and wire bonding can also be performed at high precision. As a result, a circuit device manufacturing method can be realized by which high precision wire bonding can be performed even on a small-area integrated type conductive patterns such as those of cluster block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> wherein mounting parts are formed in 10 rows and 5 columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Furthermore by the resolving of the problem of the nitrogen gas for prevention of oxidation of the conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> surface as described above, nitrogen gas can be used throughout the wire bonding process. Since the surface of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will thus not become oxidized, for example, the degradation of adhesiveness with resin, due to the antioxidant film, which can accommodate temperatures up to 150&deg; C., peeling as a result of oxidation of the conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> surface, can be prevented. As a result, a circuit device manufacturing method can be realized by which the anti-moisture property and anti-peeling property at the surfaces of bonding of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next in the fourth step of this invention, molding in common by insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is performed so as to cover the circuit elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the respective mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in a batch and fill the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In this process, insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is made to cover circuit elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B and the plurality of conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>C completely and insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is filled in the isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> between conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> so as to fit and bind strongly with the bent structures at the side faces of conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>C as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(A). Conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are thus supported by insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> This step may also be realized by transfer molding, injection molding, or potting. In terms of resin material, a thermosetting resin, such as epoxy resin, etc., may be used for transfer molding, and a thermoplastic resin, such as polyimide resin, polyphenylene sulfide, etc.; may be used for injection molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The thickness of insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that is made to cover the conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> surface is adjusted so that uppermost part of a bonding wire <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A of a circuit element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> will be covered by approximately 10 &mgr;m of resin. This thickness can be made thicker or thinner in consideration of strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A characteristic of this step is that until insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is coated, the conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that is to become conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is the supporting substrate and the conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that is to be the supporting substrate is a material that is necessary as an electrode material. The merit that work can be performed by eliminating as much component material as possible is thus provided and cost reductions can also be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Since isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are formed to be shallower than the thickness of the conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is not separated into individual conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The sheet-form conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can thus be handled in one piece, thus providing the characteristic that the work of conveying to a die and the work of constituting to a die in the process of molding insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are made extremely easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In the fifth step of this invention, the conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at thick parts at which isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are not provided is eliminated as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In this step, the rear surface of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is removed chemically and/or physically to separate the respective conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. This step is carried out by polishing, grinding, etching, vaporization of metal by laser, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In experiments, the entire surface was ground by approximately 30 &mgr;m by a polishing device or grinding device to expose insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The exposed surface is indicated by a dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(A). As a result, conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are made approximately 40 &mgr;m in thickness and separated. Also, the entire surface of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be wet etched until immediately before insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> becomes exposed and the entire surface may then be ground by a polishing or grinding device to expose insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the entire surface of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be wet etched to the position indicated by the dotted line in order to expose insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As a result, a structure is provided with which the rear faces of conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are exposed on insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The structure is thus one with which the surface of insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that has been filled in isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is practically matched with the surfaces of conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The circuit devices <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of this invention thus have the characteristic that they can be moved horizontally as they are by the surface tension of solder, etc., and become self-aligned in the mounting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Rear surface treatment of conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is furthermore performed to obtain the final structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. That is, solder or other conductive material is deposited onto the exposed conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as necessary in order to complete the circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the sixth step of this invention, the characteristics of the circuit elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the respective mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that have been molded in a batch with insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are measured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> After performing rear surface etching of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the prior process, the respective blocks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are cut off from conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Since each block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is joined by insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the remaining parts of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, it can be cut off by peeling from the remaining parts of conductive foil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> mechanically and without using a cutting die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the rear surfaces of conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are exposed at the rear surface of each block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the respective mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are aligned in matrix form in exactly the same manner as they were when conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> were formed. By contacting rear surface electrodes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which are exposed from insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of conductive patterns <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, with a probe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the characteristic parameters, etc., of the circuit elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the respective mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are measured individually to make pass/fail judgments, and defective items are marked with magnetic ink, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In this process, circuit devices <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the respective mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are held integrally according to block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and are thus not separated individually. Thus by pitch feeding a block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> placed on a setting base of a tester by just the size of a mounting part <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal and horizontal directions as indicated by the arrows, the circuit devices <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the respective mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be measured extremely rapidly and in large amounts. That is, since the judgment between the front and rear of a circuit device, recognition of the position of electrodes, etc., which were necessary priorly, can be made unnecessary, considerable reduction of the measurement time can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Next in the seventh step of this invention, insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is separated according to each mounting part <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> by dicing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In this step, block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is sucked by vacuum onto a setting base of a dicing device and insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at isolation trenches <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is diced along dicing lines <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> between the respective mounting parts <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> by means of a dicing blade <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to accomplish separation into the individual circuit devices <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In this step, dicing blade <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is preferably operated to a cutting depth at which insulating resin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is substantially severed and chocolate breaking by a roller is performed after taking out block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from the dicing device. In the dicing process, the positioning marks <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, which were provided in advance in the above-described first step in a manner whereby they oppose each other at the inner sides of the frame-like pattern <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that surrounds each block, are recognized and dicing is performed using these marks as reference. Though it is well known, for dicing, dicing in the longitudinal direction is performed along all dicing lines <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and then the setting base is rotated by 90 degrees to perform dicing in the horizontal direction along dicing lines <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Circuit devices <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are thus completed by the above-described manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Though the case where cluster blocks are formed on a conductive foil was described for this invention&apos;s circuit device manufacturing method, this invention is not necessarily limited to this case and the same effects can be obtained for substrates comprising conductive members, such as lead frames, etc. Various other modifications are also possible within a range that does not fall outside the gist of this invention. </paragraph>
