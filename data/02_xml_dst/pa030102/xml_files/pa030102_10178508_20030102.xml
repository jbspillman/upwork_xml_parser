<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The electronic Entertainment Vending Machine (EVM) methodology is an easy-to-use and integrated system which allows for the speedy control and quality downloading of entertainment selections by the user. Entertaiment can be music, audio, movies, videos, personal messages, and any other digitally exploitable entertainment. The principles inherent in the old-fashioned vending machine have been transformed to operate within the world of the Internet. In addition, unlike subscription systems, Applicants have modeled the user payment policy on the E-ZPass toll collection system or debit system in which there is a balance reduction of a prepaid account as each individual transaction occurs. This system can allow the purchaser of entertainment to see the value of each transaction. This monetization of intellectual capital differs from existing systems. This system is not a peer-to-peer technology. Music rests on a server, which gives absolute control of quality and downloading speed. Specific information such as who is choosing the entertainment, what entertainment is being chosen, when it is chosen, and where it is being downloaded can be known and stored for future reference. The back-end (management) system helps to create the business relationship between the music industry (e.g., record labels) and Applicants, and also allows greater control avoiding the downloading problems that frequently occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Unlike a subscription system for purchasing entertainment, the music industry can monetize individual artists such that when downloading occurs, there is price control. Entertainment by popular artists will cost more than that of less popular artists. Catalogs, artists, retailers and other distribution mechanisms can easily be incorporated into the EVM method because the controls are already in place. Downloading of entertainment does not have to be done in real time, but can be zipped. The consumer benefits from this because of the ease and simplicity of the operation and because the present vending machine allows one to get a free sample of the product for 15 seconds before one commits to downloading the full selection. Therefore, the user can be sure that they like the song and it is the correct version before purchasing it. The EVM methodology provides a solution to the problems associated with subscription models. The debit function will allow the record labels and other entertainment companies to collect more money at the end of the day, giving them a better retail opportunity to mark up or discount the individual artists. This will also tie into the back-end accounting package and can give rapid and accurate royalty payments. The prepaid account system makes the transaction quick, easy, and convenient for the user. There is no handling of coins or paper currency. All financial transactions can be performed electronically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The music buyer is less likely to sign up for a wide variety of subscriptions when they can just keep a debit account with the. EVM and use it at their convenience. Traditionally, a buyer may pay $10 to $20 per month to have 5 or 6 different services. The EVM methodology allows a user&apos;s account to be automatically be replenished as with an EZPass system. In the alternative, a buyer can replenish their account when in use. This is possible because Applicants can send the user an e-mail (or possibly notification on the website itself, if the user is in the process of downloading entertainment), if the debit balance has become too low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the present invention allows for the possibility of a computer crashing or a system going down during a period when the user has logged on and made their selections. In this event, once the system starts again, the EVM remembers where it was and continues the operation, so the consumer can be assured that he receives everything for which he has paid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The EVM can be crafted with software, computer technology, the Internet, and personal communication systems to provide non-stop entertainment vending on the Internet. The invention allows the power of the Internet to provide entertainment across the globe through the system of entertainment vending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention is illustrated by the following examples which should not be considered limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Sample Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Step 1. User will come to the website and click on the JOIN button. This will take them to a form, in which they will fill out information about themselves. At this time they are given a username and password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Step 2. With the assigned username and password, the user can log into the EVM. Once they are logged on, they can click on the DEPOSIT button, which will bring them to the DEPOSIT form. The form will allow them to put a deposit into their account, which allows them to purchase songs. When a user&apos;s balance reaches a minimum, the user will receive a message letting them know to make another deposit. They will also have the option to have their balance automatically increased when it reaches a set amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Step 3. With a balance in their account, the user can search for a song by artist name, song title, or music type. When they have found the song they searched for, they will click on the SELECT button. This will enter the selected song in the SELECTION box on the EVM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Step 4. With a song in the SELECTION box, the user has the opportunity to listen to a free sample of that selected song by clicking on the SAMPLE button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Step 5. Once the user has confirmed that the selected song is what they would like to purchase, they can click on the DOWNLOAD button. The DOWNLOAD button starts the download process of the song to the user&apos;s computer, and at the same time, subtracts the cost of that song from their balance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Step 6. Clicking on the FUTURE RELEASES button opens a separate window containing a list of songs that will be available at a future date. When a song is chosen, email will be sent to let the user know when it is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The following example is a description of a dedicated hardware version of the EVM. This version is used substantially or exclusively for electronic entertainment vending. The technology remains exactly the same. The EVM can be placed in an environment other than an individual&apos;s laptop or desktop computer. The concept allows Applicants to license the necessary hardware to utilize the EVM in many different environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An EVM may be placed in the first-class lounge of an airline. It can become another distribution mechanism for the sale of compact discs (i.e., CD&apos;s). As a marketing tool, the EVM has the following functions. A passenger (i.e., consumer) is given a free, blank CD, compliments of both the airline and an advertiser. The consumer can go over to the EVM and download several songs. The EVM normally operates as an EZPass type of payment method where the user would have already entered his or her credit card and will draw against a prepaid account. However, in this case, an adjustment is made so the music is downloaded and the user does not have to pay. Applicants cover the royalties with the music industry, and licensing revenues are obtained from advertisers. Should the user wish to do more on the EVM, he has the option of going through the electronic process of entering credit card information and downloading entertainment at his own expense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Another example of a dedicated hardware version is a retail unit that a licensee would place in a large department store. A CD may be purchased which contains songs that the user would compile with the EVM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Since the EVM lends itself to audio and video commercials, part of its revenue stream may generated by selling advertising space. The dedicated hardware version of the EVM allows Applicants to become part of the major distribution system of the music industry. It allows Applicants to present to the music industry opportunities for selling CDs and promoting new artists in areas where major CD sales do not take place in the general retail environment. It also acts as a mechanism to promote new artists and download their CDs in areas that may sell CDs in general, but incurring the additional expense of carrying inventory on non-popular or new artists would be necessary. This concept can also be carried over to hotels. People can have the opportunity to choose the music they like similar to how they pay for watching a movie. However, the distribution method for personalized selection and downloading music or videos as disclosed by the present invention is unique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art, having the benefit of the teachings of the present invention as hereinabove set forth, can effect numerous modifications thereto. These modifications are to be construed as being encompassed within the scope of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
