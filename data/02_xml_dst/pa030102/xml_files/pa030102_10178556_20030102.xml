<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system and method for automatically generating software for use in SECS (Semiconductor Equipment Communications Standard) communications, and more particularly, to a system and method for automatically generating software such that coding of a source program for use in controlling equipments is automatically performed through the selection of data corresponding to SECS messages defining operations of the equipments involved in a semiconductor processing system for use in the SECS message communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, a semiconductor processing system is linked to a host by way of equipment servers (hereinafter, referred to as &ldquo;EQS&rdquo;) that supervise a group of equipments involved in a process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Each of the equipments reports to the host the progressing status and results of each process. The host performs functions such as supervising and managing a series of semiconductor fabricating processes based on the report. Semiconductor fabricating equipments are generally classified into preprocessing equipments, assembly equipments, test and inspection equipments, other related equipments, etc. Since the semiconductor fabricating process is such a complex and diverse process that includes more than 500 steps, there are a variety of equipments involved therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is difficult to effectively manage the whole semiconductor fabricating process. To cope with the difficulty, most semiconductor fabricating equipments are managed by using a protocol for use in controlling them. The widely used protocol is a SECS protocol. That is, the SECS protocol is a communication protocol for supporting communication between equipments specifically designed for the semiconductor fabricating processes. The SECS protocol is a protocol or standard established by SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Material International) in order to efficiently achieve the communications between the semiconductor fabricating equipments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The SECS is broken down into three layers: a GEM layer (GEM (Generic Equipment Model) and Application layer) for managing the semiconductor fabricating processes; a message generating layer (SECS-II layer) for reporting the progressing status and results of each process; and a message transmitting/receiving layer (SECS-I layer) for transmitting and receiving the generated message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The SECS-I and SCS-II define communication interface standards between the semiconductor fabricating equipments and the host. The standards describe details for physical connection, signal size, data rate, protocol logic, and the like, which are required for message (information) exchange between the equipments and the host. The information exchange is made through a serial point-to-point line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> All the messages transferred based on the SECS protocol obey one or more message transfer standards, and each of the message transfer standards is processed as one transaction. Combinations of those transactions control and manage the semiconductor fabricating processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An operator of the semiconductor fabricating processes analyzes the feature of the equipments by using the SECS communication software and the processing procedures of the semiconductor fabricating processes executed by the equipments, prior to putting the SECS communication software into running. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Then, the operator prepares a scenario of the semiconductor fabricating processes based on the analysis results, wherein the scenario is mainly represented by flow of messages to be transferred between the host and the equipments. Such flow of messages constitutes the semiconductor fabricating processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example of a plurality of SECS messages transferred between the equipment and the server (EQS) in the SECS communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the equipment transfers a SECS message of &ldquo;S1 F13&rdquo; representing communication establishment to EQS in order to start the semiconductor fabricating process. The EQS transfers an acknowledgment message of &ldquo;S1 F14&rdquo; to the equipment in order to respond to the message from the equipment. The equipment transfers a SECS message of &ldquo;S1 F1&rdquo; to the EQS, which is a query inquiring whether the equipment exists, and then, receives an acknowledgment message of &ldquo;S1 F2&rdquo; from the EQS. Subsequently, the equipment transfers a SECS message of &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; representing a mode change into the process control mode to the EQS, and receives an acknowledgment message &ldquo;S6 F12&rdquo; from the EQS. The operator for the equipment puts a product on the work table prior to starting the semiconductor fabricating process (Product Loading). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> After the product loading, the operator for the equipment transfers a SECS message of &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; representing a loading completion to the EQS. The EQS transfers an acknowledgment message of &ldquo;S6 F12&rdquo; and a SECS message of &ldquo;S2 F41&rdquo; representing the instructions &ldquo;start commission&rdquo; to the EQS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The equipment transfers an acknowledgment message &ldquo;S2 F42&rdquo; in response to the message &ldquo;S2 F41&rdquo; to the EQS, and transfers a SECS message &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; representing the process start to the EQS, and then receives an acknowledgment message &ldquo;S6 F12&rdquo; in response to the message &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; from the EQS. The operator of the equipment starts the fabricating process. When the fabricating process end, the operator for the equipment transfers a message of &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; representing an end of the process to the EQS, and then receives an acknowledgment message &ldquo;S6 F12&rdquo; from the EQS. The equipment transfers a message &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; of &ldquo;Move Out Request&rdquo; representing the product unloading from the work table to the EQS. The equipment receives an acknowledgment message &ldquo;S6 F12&rdquo; from the EQS, and unloads the process-finished product from the worktable (Unload a Cassette). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The equipment transfers a message &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; of &ldquo;Move Out Complete&rdquo; representing the completion of the product unloading to the EQS, and receives an acknowledgment message &ldquo;S6 F12&rdquo; for the message of &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; from the EQS. The equipment transfers a message &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; representing the preparation of the next process to the EQS, and receives an acknowledgment message &ldquo;S6 F12&rdquo; from the EQS. With this, the series of the semiconductor fabricating process is finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is found that the SECS messages of &ldquo;S6, F11&rdquo; and &ldquo;S6, F12&rdquo; are used several times. That is, a SECS message is composed of a pair of one query SECS message and one response SECS message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The query and response process between the EQS and the equipment may be described as follow: for example, when the SECS message of &ldquo;S6, F11&rdquo; is transmitted from the equipment to the EQS, an operator of the EQS should check data values contained in the received SECS message of &ldquo;S6, F11&rdquo; to analyze what the data values mean. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further, the operator should generate a response message and a control message corresponding thereto, and then, must perform a manual coding of a source program for implementing the generated response and control messages and send it to the equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example of a SECS message transferred between the equipment and the server (EQS) in the SECS communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, each SECS message presents a unique expression thereof such as &ldquo;S6, F11&rdquo;, a combination of one of stream numbers (S1 to S128) and one of function numbers (F1 to F128). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it may be easily understood that the SECS message of &ldquo;S6, F11&rdquo; is used for host command confirmation (HCA) b the Function name of which because the transfer direction is from the equipment to the EQS, and it is necessary for the EQS to respond to the message toward the equipment. Further, the item of the SECS data included in &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; message is &ldquo;L, 3&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). That is, &ldquo;L, 3(<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>)&rdquo; means three data lines, the first line contains &lt;DATAID&gt; (<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>) representing a series of data ID, the second line contains &lt;CEID&gt; (<highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>) representing &ldquo;collect event ID&rdquo;, and the third line contains &ldquo;L,2&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>) composed of two lines. The first line of &ldquo;L,2&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>) contains &lt;RPTID&gt; representing &ldquo;report ID&rdquo;, and the second line of L,2 is composed of another three lines L,3 (<highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>) which contain &lt;PORT&gt; (<highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>) representing &ldquo;port number&rdquo;, &lt;LOTID&gt; (<highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>) representing &ldquo;lot or product ID&rdquo;, and &lt;PPID&gt; (<highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>) representing &ldquo;process program ID&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The operator of the EQS analyzes the characteristics of the equipment and process flow of the semiconductor fabricating process implemented by the equipment. In addition, the operator for the equipment generates a scenario of the semiconductor fabricating process based on the analysis result, and should conduct coding of data of the SECS messages used in SECS communication as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Generally, full automation of an individual equipment is achievable when it involves 20&tilde;30 or 50&tilde;60 at most SECS messages. Each SECS message is previously defined so that they are transmitted to the equipment or server at a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> If a single SECS message is used for a single specific condition, there would be no difficulty in controlling the equipment. Under certain conditions, however, a single SECS message may be used in more than one condition as &ldquo;S6 F11&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and further, the status of the respective equipment is defined by the data values contained in the message, which may arise problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Therefore, since the operator should spend a lot of time in analyzing all of several tens SECS messages transferred between the equipment and the EQS and in coding the source program, there is a problem in that work efficiency is severely lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the semiconductor fabricating equipments are relatively expensive. In operating such expensive semiconductor fabricating equipments, if an EQS is made and then directly applied to the equipments without any prior test of the EQS, this is most undesirable in view of use of the equipments and as well is a factor in reduction of productivity thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the conventional SECS communication software mentioned above bears a drawback that it is equipment-specific or equipment-dependent; that is, it should be reorganized according to each feature of the semiconductor fabricating equipments whenever used to perform operation and management for each fabricating process. Thus, the SECS communication software could not have a consistent structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As a result, since the SECS communication software should be adapted to various fabricating equipments, which entails a variety of problems such as duplicated investment, lowering of reliability due to repeated tests, difficulty in maintenance, and the like. </paragraph>

The control unit <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> simulates and tests each SECS message by operating the test simulation unit <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and setting the equipment simulation and the equipment server simulation, etc. by using the simulation program. (Step S<highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>) As a result of the simulation, if there is a SECS message presenting an error, a warning message display may be provided for re-defining and re-setting. The operator checks the warning message and redefines the corresponding SECS message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> If the simulation test finds no error, the control unit <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> operates the communication interface defining unit <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. The communication interface defining unit <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> establishes a communication interface on the basis of the port setting data and the driver data inputted at the definition process for the equipment feature and the equipment server in order to communicate with the equipments <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and other devices through the NIC <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Once the communication interface is set, the control unit <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> performs the SECS message communication with the equipments <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>). For instance, after the control unit <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> receives a SECS message from the equipment <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the control unit transmits a responding SECS message to the equipment <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In summary, the first preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention provides a method for automatically generating SECS message program source according to the definition of the data required for the SECS message communication of the semiconductor fabricating system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, a plurality of the computer programs or softwares are used and executed in the circumstance of the Internet. For example, special softwares such as Active Server Page (ASP) and Java Server Page (JSP) are used in order to generate web sites and embody various functions of the web site on the Internet. Moreover, the Internet may overcome limitations in time and space via which controlling a system and device at the remote place becomes possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> schematically shows a constitution of the Internet system for use in fabricating semiconductor, describing a method according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, for the purpose of illustration, the same reference numbers will be used for the same elements shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The Internet system for semiconductor fabrication according to the second embodiment of the present invention comprises: the Internet <highlight><bold>1810</bold></highlight> as a communication channel for transmitting and receiving data between a plurality of remote computers; at least one host computer <highlight><bold>1820</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1830</bold></highlight> connected to the Internet for managing a plurality of equipment servers (EQSs); at least one equipments <highlight><bold>1840</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>1846</bold></highlight> for performing a semiconductor fabrication process; at least one equipment server (EQS) <highlight><bold>1850</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>1856</bold></highlight> for generating and transmitting a response SECS message for a query SECS message from the equipment <highlight><bold>1840</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>1846</bold></highlight> on the basis of the extensible Markup Language (XML). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> For example, the Internet system in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> may consist of the first host computer <highlight><bold>1820</bold></highlight> for managing a plurality of the EQSs <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> in the region of Busan, and the second host computer <highlight><bold>1840</bold></highlight> connected with the first host computer through the Internet for managing a plurality of the EQSs <highlight><bold>1850</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>1856</bold></highlight> in the region of Seoul which is more than 500 km away from Busan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The extensible Markup Language (XML) is a descriptive language for a web page standardized by the World Wide Web consortium (WWW consortium) for the purpose of substituting the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). The XML extends the link function of the HTML and optimizes the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) for use in the Internet, having the advantages of both the HTML and the SGML. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The XML has a hierarchy structure, and enables for the user to uniquely define Tags and describe a document such that it is suitable for expressing the SECS/GEM/HSMS protocol used for controlling semiconductor fabricating equipments. Moreover, the XML enables for a user to define and edit the SECS/GEM/HSMS protocol by using various parsers and the extensible Style-sheet Language (XSL) for expressing a style sheet. The XSL is a language used for making a style sheet illustrating how data communicated through the web is presented to user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the Internet system as above, for example, the host computer <highlight><bold>1830</bold></highlight> at Seoul may connect with the host computer <highlight><bold>1820</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>1810</bold></highlight>, and may control a plurality of EQSs <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> managed by the host computer <highlight><bold>1820</bold></highlight>. That is, when a system manager connects to a web site for controlling whole the system through the host computer <highlight><bold>1830</bold></highlight> at Seoul, the web site provides a web page displaying a menu for managing each of the remote semiconductor fabricating system, a menu for showing the present condition of the equipments, a menu for defining the EQS, a menu for defining the SECS message, and a menu for generating the SECS message source and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> And then, when the system manager selects the menu for showing the present condition of the EQSs <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> managed by the host computer <highlight><bold>1820</bold></highlight> at Busan, the web page displaying the SECS messages communicated between the EQSs <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and the equipments <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> For example, if the query SECS message from the third equipment <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is not settled, the web page presents a picture that the corresponding query SECS message have been transmitted to the EQS <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> but not settled yet. The system manager learns this status and subsequently recognizes the occurrence of error in the source of transmission of the SECS message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the system manager selects a menu for generating the SECS message on the web page, and then may redefine the SECS message following the steps of S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&tilde;S<highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and re-establish the SECS message by combining the defined feature of the third equipment <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and the EQS3 <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the system manager performs the function for transmitting the response SECS message to the third equipment <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The redefined SECS message may be generated by using the XML. These processes may be easily performed since the EQS has made a status history log file, a SECS communication log file and even the SECS message in the format of the XML. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the system manager may define and generate new SECS messages on the web site following the steps of S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&tilde;S<highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, and generate the corresponding SECS message source, and finally have the EQSs perform the SECS message communication with remote systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment of the present invention, there is provided the Internet system for the semiconductor fabrication capable of automatically generating SECS message source and controlling the SECS message communication of the EQSs <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> at remote place through the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been shown and described with respect to the preferred embodiments, it will be understood by the skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In addition, the inventive method and system may be applied to the GEM (Generic Equipment Model) or HSMC (High-speed SECS Message Services) system although the invention was described with respect to SECS system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a series of automation operations can be fast achieved, the maintenance thereof becomes easier since the program source for the SECS message may be automatically generated only by defining the semiconductor fabricating equipment and the equipment server (EQS), and then defining the SECS messages required for the SECS communication between the equipments and EQS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible to provide a more stable environment for fabricating the semiconductor by automating the equipment and constructing a database for the data required in the process of the semiconductor fabrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides functions for controlling the SECS communication between remote equipments for fabricating semiconductor and the equipment servers (EQSs), and functions for defining the SECS and HSMS protocol in the form of the XML. In addition, since the automation, maintenance and repair of the equipments which are geographically dispersed done are done by using the Internet at a center site, the cost required for the automation and management of the semiconductor fabricating equipment can be enormously reduced. </paragraph>
