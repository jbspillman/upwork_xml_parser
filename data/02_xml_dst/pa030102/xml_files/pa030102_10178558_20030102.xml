<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device capable of improving an electrical characteristic thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, there was known a non-volatile semiconductor memory device such as a flash memory as one of semiconductor devices. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view showing a prior art non-volatile semiconductor memory device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a schematic partly enlarged sectional view of the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Description will be given of a prior art non-volatile semiconductor memory device with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>, an element formation region of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is a region surrounded with an isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, including a region having a flat top surface and a region that is a boundary portion abutting on the isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, where a step section <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is formed. In the element formation region, a tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed on a main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed so as to cover the flat portion of the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and in addition, extend over step section <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. A peripheral edge portion <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on step section <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is thinner than a portion of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on the flat top surface in the element formation region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed so as to cover the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and extend to near the top of isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a tunnel oxide film, though not shown, is also formed on regions opposite to the region where tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed with isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> interposing therebetween on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and floating gate electrodes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed on the tunnel oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An ONO film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is formed on floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. ONO film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is a stacked film composed of a lower layer oxide film, a nitride film formed on the lower layer oxide film, and an upper layer oxide film formed on the nitride film. A polysilicon film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed on ONO film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. A Tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is formed on polysilicon film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. A control gate electrode is constituted of polysilicon film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. An oxide film <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> formed using a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method is layered on tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Note that on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a source region and drain region are formed at opposite positions with the region where the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed interposing therebetween in a direction normal to the sheet of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are schematic sectional views for describing a method of manufacturing the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>. Description will be given of a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference> with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> First of all, a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) is formed on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>). A silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) is formed on silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. A resist film having a pattern for openings is formed on silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with the openings on regions where isolation insulating films <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>) are formed, using a photolithographic processing technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Then, silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> are partly removed by etching using the resist film as a mask. As a result, openings <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) are formed in silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the resist film is removed. A resulting structure is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. Note that in the above etching step, the top surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is also partly removed at the bottom of opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, an exposed surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at the bottom of opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is subjected to oxidation, thereby forming an isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. At this time, since isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, grows up into under a lower end portion of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the lower end portion of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is shaped so as to sit on an upper end portion of isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>) having been used as a mask is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>) is removed using wet etching. At this time, a top surface layer of insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is partly removed by wet etching simultaneously with part of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. For this reason, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, with removal of the surface layer of isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, step sections <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> are formed at a peripheral edge portion of the element formation region of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The etching for removing silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is continued to a height of step section <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> above isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the order of 10 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, there is formed a sacrifice oxide film (not shown) for protecting the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, followed by implantation of conductive impurities for forming a source region, a drain region and so on into the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. After implantation of the conductive impurities, the sacrifice oxide film is removed by wet etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed on the element formation region located between isolation insulating films <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> using a wet oxidation method or the like method. At this time, tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in a region on the step section <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is thinner than in the other region thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, sequentially formed on tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are floating gate electrodes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, ONO film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, polysilicon film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and oxide film <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in that order, thus obtaining the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As other prior art examples of non-volatile semiconductor memory device, there can be presented a non-volatile semiconductor memory device of a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view showing another example of prior art non-volatile semiconductor memory device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Description will be given of another example of prior art non-volatile semiconductor memory device with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the non-volatile semiconductor memory device has a structure fundamentally similar to that of the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>, with a difference in structure of an element isolation region therebetween. That is, while in the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>, isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> formed using a so-called LOCOS method is provided; in the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26, a</cross-reference> so-called trench isolation structure is adopted in the element isolation region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> That is, trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are formed so as to abut on the element formation region of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. A nitride region <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is formed in semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> constituting a sidewall surface and bottom surface of trench <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. An inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is formed on the sidewall surface and the bottom surface of the trench <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. A trench isolation film <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is formed so as to fill the interior of trench <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> on inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. A top portion of trench isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is formed so as to project above the top surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> There is formed an extended portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of nitride region <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> formed on the sidewall and bottom of trench <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> along a peripheral edge portion of an element formation region which is a region surrounded with trench isolation insulation film <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed on the element formation region in the main surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> at a peripheral edge portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> thereof (a portion of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on extended portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) is thinner than at central portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> thereof. This is because as shown in a fabrication process described later, extended portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which is a nitride region, has been formed on the main surface portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> when tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed thereon, therefore, a formation speed of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on extended portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is smaller than on the other region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Note that, a structure in the upper layer side above tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is fundamentally similar to that of the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are schematic sectional views for describing a method of manufacturing the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, description will be given of a method of manufacturing the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> First of all, silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>) is formed on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed on silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. A resist film (not shown) having a pattern for openings is formed on silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with the openings located on regions where trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>) are formed. Silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is partly removed with the resist film as a mask. Thereafter, the resist film is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are partly etched off with patterned silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as a mask, with the result that trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> are formed. Thereafter, inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>) is formed on the sidewall and bottom of trenches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Then, by nitriding the sidewall and bottom wall of trench <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, nitride region <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is formed. In such a way, a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is obtained. Note that the reason why nitride region <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is formed is that crystal defects are prevented from occurring in semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by a heat treatment subsequent to a step of forming a HDP (High Density Plasma)-CVD silicon oxide film, described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In formation of nitride region <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, a region of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> under the peripheral edge portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is also partly nitrided. As a result, in the region under the peripheral edge portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, there is formed extended portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by advancement of a nitride region partly into the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Then, a HDP-CVD silicon oxide film (an oxide formed with a HDP-CVD method) is formed so as to fill the interior of trench <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, a resist film (not shown) having a pattern is formed on the HDP-CVD silicon oxide film. The HDP-CVD silicon oxide film is partly etched off with the resist film as a mask. As a result, a depression is formed in a region of HDP-CVD silicon oxide film on silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Thereafter the resist film is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Then, top portions of the HDP-CVD silicon oxide film and silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are polished off using a CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) method, thereby planarizing the top surface of the HDP-CVD silicon oxide film. Thereafter, silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is removed to obtain a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is removed by wet etching. A sacrifice oxide film (not shown) is formed on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, followed by a step of implantation for forming impurity regions such as a source region and a drain region. Thereafter, the sacrifice oxide film is removed by wet etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Similar to a step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed on the main surface of semiconductor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> using a wet oxidation method. At this time, a forming speed of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on extended region <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which is a nitride region, is smaller than that of the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> on the other region. For this reason, tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on extended portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is thinner than on the other region (central portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) with the result of a structure fabricated as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, sequentially formed on tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are floating gate electrodes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, ONO film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, polysilicon film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and oxide film <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and so on in that order, thus obtaining the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> There have been problems, as described below, in the prior art non-volatile semiconductor memory devices described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> That is, in the non-volatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, since tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on step section <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is thinner than on the other region, a threshold voltage of the non-volatile semiconductor memory device has a chance to be different from a design value. Furthermore, in the non-volatile semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> as well, tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on extended portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is thinner than on the other region due to the presence of extended portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which is a nitride region. As a result, a threshold voltage of the non-volatile semiconductor memory device in the latter case also has a chance to be different from a design value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, for example, in a case where a non-volatile semiconductor memory device is a DINOR flash memory, a problem has been produced due to a defect such as gate disturb. Furthermore, in an NOR flash memory, since a threshold voltage distribution in erase operation is wider than in a design, an electrical characteristic has had a chance to be deteriorated. In such a manner, in a prior art non-volatile semiconductor memory device, a problem has had a chance to occur due to a deteriorated electrical characteristic caused by local thinning of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device capable of preventing deterioration in electrical characteristic thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the present invention, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device is provided. The semiconductor device includes: a semiconductor substrate having an element formation region and an element isolation region abutting on the element formation region, a step section being formed at a boundary portion between the element formation region and the element isolation region on a main surface of the semiconductor substrate; an insulating film including an oxide film formed so as to cover the element formation region and in addition, extend over the step section on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate; and a gate electrode formed on the insulating film. The thickness of the insulating film on the element formation region may be almost equal to that of the insulating film on the step section. The method includes: a step of forming the step section on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate; and a step of forming the oxide film on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate using an active oxygen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> With such a process adopted, since the active oxygen has an extremely strong oxidizing capability, an oxide film can be formed to an almost uniform thickness on a main surface of a semiconductor substrate without receiving any influence of the presence of a step section thereon even when the step section is present on the main surface of a semiconductor substrate on which the oxide film is formed. In a semiconductor device fabricated using the method described above, since the insulating film is not locally thinner on the step section, as compared with other regions, a phenomenon can be prevented from occurring that when a voltage is applied to the gate electrode, an electric field strength in the insulating film on the step section is locally enhanced. In a case where an insulating film is used as, for example, a tunnel insulating film of a non-volatile semiconductor memory device, it can be prevented that a threshold voltage of the non-volatile semiconductor memory device or the like characteristic thereof changes due to a local variation in thickness of the insulating film. That is, an electrical characteristic of a semiconductor device is prevented from being deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;almost equal&rdquo; in the above one aspect of the invention means that a difference between a thickness of the insulating film on the element forming region and the thickness of the insulating film on the step section is preferably less than 20%, more preferably less than 10%, in particular less than 5%, relative to the thickness of the insulating film on the element formation region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device is provided. The semiconductor device includes: a semiconductor substrate having a main surface, the main surface of the semiconductor substrate including one region, which is nitrided, and the other region, which is not nitrided and abutting on the one region; an insulating film including an oxide film formed on the one region and the other region of the main surface of the semiconductor substrate; and a gate electrode formed on the insulating film. The thickness of the insulating film on the one region may be almost equal to that of the insulating film on the other region. The method includes: a step of forming the one region by partially nitriding the main surface of the semiconductor substrate; and a step of forming the oxide film on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate using an active oxygen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> With such a process adopted, since the active oxygen has an extremely strong oxidizing capability, an oxide film can be formed to an almost uniform thickness on a main surface of a semiconductor substrate without receiving any influence of the presence of a nitrided region thereon even when the nitrided region is present on the main surface of a semiconductor substrate on which the oxide film is formed. In a semiconductor device fabricated using the method described above, since an insulating film is not locally thinner on one region, which is a nitrided region, a phenomenon can be prevented from occurring that when a voltage is applied to the gate electrode, an electric field strength is locally enhanced in the insulating film on the one region. For this reason, in a case where an insulating film is used, for example, as a tunnel insulating film of a non-volatile semiconductor device, it is prevented that a threshold voltage of the non-volatile semiconductor memory device changes due to a local variation in thickness of the insulating film. That is, an electrical characteristic of a semiconductor device is prevented from being deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;almost equal&rdquo; in the above another aspect of the invention means that a difference between a thickness of the insulating film on the one region and the thickness of the insulating film on the other region is preferably less than 20%, more preferably less than 10%, in particular less than 5%, relative to the thickness of the insulating film on the other region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Description will be given of embodiments of the present invention based on the accompanying drawings. Note that the same reference numerals are attached to the same or corresponding constituents on the following figures and no description thereof is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, description will be given of a first embodiment of a semiconductor device according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the semiconductor device is a non-volatile semiconductor memory device and, to be concrete, is a DINOR or NOR flash memory. The semiconductor device is fabricated in an element formation region surrounded with an isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> located in first and second element isolation regions on a main surface of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The element formation region of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a flat top surface (a flat section). Step sections <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed at a boundary portion between the element forming region and isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as an insulating film is formed on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed so as to cover the flat section on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and extend over step sections <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A thickness of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is on the order in the range of 30 nm to 50 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed so as to cover tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and extend to near the top portions of isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a tunnel oxide film, though not shown, is also formed, on regions opposite to the region where tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed with isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> interposing therebetween on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and floating gate electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed on the tunnel oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> An ONO film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed on floating gate electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. ONO film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a stacked film composed of a lower oxide film, a nitride film formed on the lower oxide film and an upper oxide film formed on the nitride film in that order. A polysilicon film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed on ONO film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed on polysilicon film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A control gate is constituted of polysilicon film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. An oxide film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed on tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> using a CVD method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a source region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a drain region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are formed at opposite positions with the region where tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed interposing therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a thickness of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a central section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is almost equal to a thickness of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a peripheral edge portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (a portion on step section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> With such a structure adopted, since tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as an insulating film has no locally thinner portion on two step portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a phenomenon can be prevented from occurring that when a voltage is applied to the control gate electrode, an electric field strength in tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on step section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is locally enhanced. For this reason, it can be prevented that a threshold voltage or the like of a semiconductor device changes due to a local variation in thickness of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. That is, an electrical characteristic of the semiconductor device can be prevented from being deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, description will be given of a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A thickness of the silicon oxide film ranges, for example, from 30 to 50 nm. A silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A thickness of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> ranges, for example, from 30 to 150 nm. A resist film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a pattern for openings is formed on silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the openings on regions where isolation insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed using a photolithographic processing technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Then, silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are partly removed by etching using resist film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a mask. As a result, openings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) are formed in silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, resist film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is removed. A resulting structure is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Note that in the above etching step, the top surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also partly removed at the bottom of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by over-etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed at the bottom of opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by oxidizing an exposed surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> there. In this step, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, since isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> grows up into under a lower end portion of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the lower end portion of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shaped so as sit on an upper end portion of isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) having been used as a mask is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) is removed by wet etching. At this time, the top surface of isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also partly removed by the wet etching simultaneously with the removal of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, by removing the surface of isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, step section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> comes to be formed at a boundary portion between the element formation region and the element isolation region in which isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is present, on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the removal of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the etching is performed till a height L of step section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) reaches a value of the order of 10 nm. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a schematic partly enlarged sectional view showing the step section of the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a sacrifice film (not shown) is formed for protection of the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, a conductive impurity is implanted into the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in order to form a source region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a drain region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and others. After such implantation of the conductive impurity, the above sacrifice oxide film is removed by wet etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed using an active oxygen on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As process conditions for the step, those described below, for example, can be adopted. That is, a reaction gas supplied into a chamber, in which semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed in oxidation performed, is composed of oxygen gas (O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and hydrogen gas (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). A flow rate of oxygen gas is 9.5 l/min and a flow rate of hydrogen gas is 0.5 l/min. Furthermore, a heating temperature is in the range of from 1000 to 1050&deg; C. and a heating time ranges from 1 min to 2 min. As a result, an active oxygen can be generated in the interior of the chamber. Since an active oxygen has an extremely strong oxidizing capability, tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be formed all over the surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to near uniformity in thickness regardless of a local surface state of the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Hence, a thickness at central section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be made almost equal to a thickness at peripheral edge portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Note that in a process step of forming tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as a heating method, there may be used an RTP (Rapid Thermal Process) or any of the like other heating methods. Furthermore, as the reaction gas, there may be used N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O gas or a mixture of NO gas and oxygen gas. Moreover, an active oxygen may be generated by a plasma generated in the interior of the chamber. Combinations of a heating method and a reaction gas can be changed in any convenient way. Furthermore, as a reaction gas used in generation of an active oxygen using a plasma, the above reaction gases can be used in a proper manner. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, description will be given of a second embodiment of a semiconductor device according to the present invention, wherein <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> semiconductor device has a structure fundamentally similar to that of the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, with a difference in a structure of an element isolation region. That is, in the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, there is provided isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed using a LOCOS method in the element isolation region, while in the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> so-called trench isolation structure is adopted in the element isolation region. That is, a trench <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed in semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to abut on the element formation region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A nitride region <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed in regions of the semiconductor substrate constituting a sidewall surface and bottom surface of trench <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. An inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed on the sidewall and the bottom of trench <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A trench isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed on inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so as to fill the interior of trench <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A top portion of trench isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed so as to project above the top surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the element formation region, which is a region surrounded with trench isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Extended portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed by extending a nitride region formed on the sidewall of trench <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in two peripheral edge portions of the element formation region surrounded with trench isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (regions abutting on trench isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). A thickness at central section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of tunnel insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is almost equal to thicknesses at peripheral edge portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (tunnel insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on extended portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as first and second regions). A structure of the upper layer side above tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fundamentally similar to that in the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> With such a structure adopted, since tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as an insulating film has no locally thinner portion in peripheral edge portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on extended portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as one region, which is a nitride region, a phenomenon can be prevented from occurring that when a voltage is applied to the control gate electrode, an electric field strength in tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on extended portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is locally enhanced. For this reason, it can be prevented that a threshold voltage of a semiconductor device changes due to a local variation in thickness of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. That is, an electrical characteristic of the semiconductor device can be prevented from being deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, description will be given of a manufacturing process for a semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> similar to the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A resist film (not shown) having a pattern for openings is formed on silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the openings located on regions where trenches <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) are formed. Silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are partly removed with the resist film as a mask. Thereafter, the resist film is removed. Semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is partly etched off with patterned silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a mask, with the result that trench <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) is formed. In such a way, a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed on the sidewall and bottom of trench <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to a thickness ranging, for example, from 30 to 50 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, by nitriding the sidewall and bottom wall of trench <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, nitride region <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed. The reason why nitride region <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed in such a way is that suppression is intended on generation of crystal defects in semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that would otherwise occur by a heat treatment subsequent to the step of forming a HDP-CVD silicon oxide film described later. In the nitriding step, by also partly nitriding a region of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> under the peripheral edge portion of silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, extended portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is a nitride region, is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Then, HDP-CVD silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed so as to fill the interior of trench <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As a result, a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> There is formed a resist film (not shown) having a pattern on HDP-CVD silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. An opening of the pattern is formed on the resist film at a region above silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. HDP-CVD silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is partly etched off with the resist film as a mask. As a result, a depression <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed in a region of HDP-CVD silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the resist film is removed, resulting in a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Then, the top portions of HDP-CVD silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are polished off using a chemical mechanical polishing method (a CMP method), thereby planarizing the top surface of HDP-CVD silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. As a result, a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, by removing silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is obtained. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is removed by wet etching. As a result, main surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Then, after a sacrifice oxide film (not shown) is formed on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an implantation step is performed for forming impurity diffused regions such as a source region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a drain region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the sacrifice oxide film is removed by wet etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Then, similar to the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed on the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using an active oxygen. That is, process conditions similar to those described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> can be used as process conditions for the above step of forming tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> using an active oxygen. In this case, while an active oxygen is generated in the chamber as a reaction vessel, the active oxygen has an extremely strong oxidizing capability. For this reason, tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having an almost uniform thickness can be formed on regions each different in state of the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from others (that is, a region in which no extended portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of nitride region exists and a region in which the extended portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> exists). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As a result, a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is obtained. Tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on extended portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the nitride region has a thickness almost equal to that of tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the central section thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Note that in the step of forming tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, there may be used an RTP (a Rapid Thermal Process) or any of other heating methods as a heating method, similar to the first embodiment of the present invention. Furthermore, as a reaction gas, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O gas or a mixture of NO gas and oxygen gas may be used. Moreover, an active oxygen may be generated by use of a plasma in the interior of the chamber. A combination of a heating method and a reaction gas can be properly selected from the above heating methods and the reaction gases. Furthermore, any of the above reaction gases can be properly used as a reaction gas for use in generation of an active oxygen in a plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, sequentially formed on tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are floating gate electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, ONO film, polysilicon film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, oxide film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and so on in that order, thereby, enabling the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> to be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>
