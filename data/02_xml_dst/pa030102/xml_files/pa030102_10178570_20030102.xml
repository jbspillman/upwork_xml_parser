<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A pilot tone generator receives optical energy from an optical communication medium carrying a plurality of optical signals. Each optical signal carries data modulated at a unique wavelength and further modulated with a unique identification signal. The identification signal has an amplitude corresponding to an optical power of the associated optical signal. The pilot tone receiver detects each identification signal from the optical energy received and determines its corresponding amplitude. The pilot tone receiver calculates the optical power of each optical signal in the optical energy in response to the amplitude of the associated identification signal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> In a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical system, it is desirable to measure optical powers of individual optical signals transported along a fiber optic link. Conventional methods of performing such power measurements require expensive components to separate the optical signals transported in the fiber prior to power measurement so that each signal may be measured individually. Not only are they expensive, these optical components tend to be physically bulky and add to the considerations during management of the fiber optic link. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it may be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a need has arisen for a technique to measure power of optical signals transferred over a fiber optic link. In accordance with the present invention, a system and method for measuring power of optical signals carried over a fiber optic link are provided that substantially eliminate or greatly reduce disadvantages and problems associated with conventional optical power measurement techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for measuring power of optical signals carried over a fiber optic link that includes receiving a plurality of optical signals from the fiber optic link with each optical signal including an identification signal modulated therewith. An amplitude of each identification signal received is determined and an optical power of each optical signal is determined in response to the amplitude of each identification signal received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides various technical advantages over conventional optical power measurement techniques. For example, one technical advantage is in the simultaneous measurement of optical power of a plurality of optical signals without separating the optical signals for individual measurement. Another technical advantage is in the use of less costly and reduced number of optical components since only the modulations of many optical signals are detected and analyzed. Yet another technical advantage is to adjust a detection bandwidth according to receiver position in the network, signal to noise ratio of received optical signals, and/or desired accuracy. Other technical advantages may be readily ascertainable by those skilled in the art from the following figures, description, and claims. </paragraph>

Similarly, other laser and pilot tone modulator units, such as <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, generate optical signals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>where the associated data input I<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is modulated at a unique predetermined wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and is modulated with a unique identification signal ID<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Optical network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a combiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> operable to receive a plurality of optical signals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>and to combine those signals into a multiple wavelength signal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As one particular example, combiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be a wavelength division multiplexer (WDM). Optical network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> communicates multiple wavelength signal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over an optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may have a plurality of spans <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of fiber, each with an optical amplifier <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or other types of optical elements including an optical add/drop multiplexer, an optical cross connect unit, signal conditioning devices, and/or lossy elements. One type of optical element used in optical network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be an optical tap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Optical tap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> allows for a distant location to capture a portion of the transmission carried by optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Optical network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a separator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> operable to separate individual optical signal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>from multiple wavelength signal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to manage optical network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it is desirable to measure the optical power of each optical signal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>carried over optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The present invention contemplates the use of identification signals ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>to measure the optical power of their corresponding optical signal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a simplified block diagram of a pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> used to measure optical power of optical signals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. The functions performed by pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be performed in hardware, software, or a combination of both. Pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives a portion of the optical transmission from optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through optical tap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Optical tap diverts a portion of the optical energy from optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the example shown, optical tap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extracts 5% of the optical energy from optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> though other percentages of extraction may be incorporated as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives the extracted optical energy of optical signals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>from optical tap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at an optical/electrical converter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Optical/electrical converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> converts the optical energy into electrical signals. The electrical signals are fed to an anti-alias filter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for removal of the high frequency component of the electrical signals. The anti-aliased electrical signals are then combined at a combiner <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with random noise from a dither source <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to improve the signal to noise quality of the original signals. The improved electrical signals are then converted into digital form by an analog to digital converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A filtering and down sampling unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> performs several functions on the digital signals received from analog to digital converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Band pass filters may be used in order to isolate the frequencies of interest in the digital signals. The data rate of the digital signals may also be down sampled to minimize processing, allow long time storage, and allow narrow detection bandwidths. Filtering and down sampling unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> then detects for each identification signal ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, either sequentially or in any desired order through changing of identification signal detection coefficients, and measures its amplitude for processing by an optical power processor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Optical power processor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> stores information from the detected identification signal in a working storage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to perform the appropriate processing and coordinates with information about pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> determined at manufacture and stored in a calibration storage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Optical power processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> determines an optical power of an associated optical signal from the amplitude of its identification signal. The measured optical power may then be used to adjust any amplifier gains within optical network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Identification signals ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>may be of a variety of types provided that, when detected, their amplitude is proportional to the optical power of the associated optical signals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. Amplitude modulation is one technique for providing the appropriate proportionality. It is also preferable for identification signals ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>to not interfere with one another during transport and detection. With no interference, the optical power of many optical signals may be measured simultaneously without individually separating out the optical signals. This requirement can be accomplished through sine wave amplitude modulation with different frequencies for each of identification signals ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. Since only a small amount of the optical energy is extracted by optical tap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, only small amplitudes of modulation are used for identification signals ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. As an example, a 4% amplitude modulation may be performed for identification signals ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. By using small amplitudes of modulation, identification signals ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>do not interfere with the data traffic carried by optical signals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. Through sine wave amplitude modulation detection, the optical power for a given optical signal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is determined as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>P&equals;R</italic></highlight>/(<highlight><italic>M*G</italic></highlight>), </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> where P is the optical power to be measured, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> R is the amplitude of the received identification signal, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> M is the index of modulation used to modulate the optical source with the identification signal, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> G is the gain of the modulation receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The accuracy of the measurement of P depends on the accuracy of each of R, M, and G. The accuracy of R, the amplitude of the identification signal, relates to the signal to noise environment at the detection point. At a location with many optical signals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>present, a noise density level N per Hertz is controlled by the aggregate of these optical signals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. The noise in the detection bandwidth B then becomes N*B. The ratio of signal S to noise in the detection bandwidth is thus S/(N*B). If an arbitrarily small optical signal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is present at the location, it may have an arbitrarily low signal to noise density ratio S/N. To achieve a specified accuracy for R, it will be required to achieve a minimum signal to noise ratio in the detection bandwidth. Thus, for small signals S, bandwidth B will be minimized to achieve a specified accuracy for R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The accuracy of M, the modulation index, is dependent upon how precisely the source modulation is known and how the modulation index changes during optical signal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> propagation. A technique for precisely controlling M at the optical source can be found in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/567,576 filed May 10, 2000 and entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Maintaining a Pre-determined Ratio of a Pilot Tone Power and a Mean Optical Output Power of an Optical Signal&rdquo; which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The variation of the modulation index during propagation is mostly dependent on an amount of amplified spontaneous emission noise included in the optical channel measurement. The amount of amplified spontaneous emission noise is related to optical bandwidth. However, with good optical carrier to noise ratios where bit error rates are less than 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight>, the variation of the modulation index with propagation is generally negligible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The accuracy of G, the modulation receiver gain, depends upon how well this parameter is known. Pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides a quantifiable output R sensitive to a particular identification signal using various optical and electronic components. The major uncertainty of G is in the variability of the operating characteristics of each optical and electrical component from one unit to the next, especially the unit to unit variability of optical taps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Being unit to unit related, this variability can be measured in conjunction with all components of pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at time of manufacture and included as calibration data stored in calibration storage <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The accuracy of G then becomes dependent upon how well it is measured at the time of manufacture and if it drifts with time and environment during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As seen in pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, detection of R occurs in the digital domain and in the program domain. This allows for an ability to vary the detection bandwidth. By being able to vary the detection bandwidth, pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be optimized for the signal to noise ratio present at a particular detection point within optical network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As optical signals propagate through optical network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the signal to noise ratio seen by pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> changes as optical channels are added or dropped from any given optical span <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. For a given accuracy of R at different detection points within optical network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, different detection bandwidths may be implemented. Also, if at a given detection point a different accuracy of R is desired, the detection bandwidth may be varied to accommodate the new accuracy requirement. Variation of the detection bandwidth may be performed on an optical signal by optical signal basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With sine wave amplitude modulation used for identification signals ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, an example limit on the narrowness of the detection bandwidth may be the sum of the phase noise of the modulation transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the phase noise at the frequency reference of pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The phase noise of the modulation transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> controls how wide the frequency is for the identification signal ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>modulation. The phase noise at the frequency reference of pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> controls a minimum detection bandwidth. An additional limitation on the narrowness of the detection bandwidth is the amount of space allocated in working storage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to perform filtering at the detection bandwidth. Signal to noise ratio improves as more information is accumulated and stored for processing. As bandwidth becomes small, the sample time desired increases. Storage requirements for longer sample times is larger than for shorter sample times. High sample rates may require a relatively large amount of storage space. Down sampling performed by filtering and down sampling unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> slows the rate that information leaves analog to digital converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that less storage space is needed for processing. This limitation may be insignificant if sufficient storage space can be provided in pilot tone receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> One of the requirements for components within optical network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relates to reliability. Certain components that carry large numbers of wavelengths and thus large amounts of data traffic should be designed with high reliability characteristics. Reliability in electronic systems can be maximized in several ways. One way is to minimize hardware and the other way is to minimize software. Lots of hardware or lots of software are well known to lead to reliability problems. By selecting the component interface for traffic critical components at the junction between filtering and down sampling unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and optical power processor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, reliability is maximized without any compromise to accuracy. Any component interface selected prior to analog to digital converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can lead to degraded accuracy due to the added complexity of conveying an analog value across the boundary. A component interface between analog to digital converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and filtering and down sampling unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> leads to less reliability due to the relatively high data rate for data across this boundary. Selecting the component interface after optical power processor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has less reliability due to the inclusion of software and the electronics associated with the processing of the power measurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an example process flow diagram for measuring power of an optical signal. The process begins at block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> where each optical signal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>is modulated with a unique identification signal. Each identification signal ID<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-ID<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is modulated with an amplitude proportional to an optical power of its associated optical signal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. The optical signals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>are multiplexed for transmission across optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A portion of the optical energy transmitted across optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is extracted at block <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by optical tap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. At block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the optical energy is converted to electrical signals. At block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the high frequency components within the electrical signals are removed. At block <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the signal to noise ratio of the electrical signals is improved. A digital representation of the electrical signals is generated at block <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. At block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> the detection bandwidth is determined. At block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, filtering is performed according to the detection bandwidth. The data rate of the digital representation is down sampled to a lower rate at block <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. An identification signal is detected at block <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and its amplitude is determined at block <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. An optical power of the associated optical signal is calculated at block <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in response to the amplitude of the identification signal. The process is repeated for each optical signal and identification signal pair carried by optical communication medium <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this manner, optical power of an optical signal is determined without having to process any of the data carried by the optical signal. </paragraph>
