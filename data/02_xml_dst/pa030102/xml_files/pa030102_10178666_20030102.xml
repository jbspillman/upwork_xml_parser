<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A communication module includes several parallel transmitting diodes and at least one monitor transmitting diode arranged on a common substrate. The module also includes at least one monitor device consisting of a monitor transmitting diode, a receiving device and a control device. A modulated optical signal generated by a monitor transmitting diode is detected by a receiver device, and is converted and transmitted as a monitor signal to the control device. Depending on the transmitted signal, the control device generates a first control signal for the driver device with the purpose of regulating the modulation flow of the transmitting diodes and the monitor transmitting diode. The modulation amplitude for the modulation stream for the monitor transmitting diodes is lower than the modulation amplitude of the modulation stream for the transmitting diodes.

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a communications module which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art apparatus of this general type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In particular, it is an object of the invention to provide a communications module of the type described at the beginning that permits the monitoring and the control of the optical output power of the transmitting diodes to be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a communication module that includes: a plurality of parallel transmitting diodes; and at least one monitor transmitting diode configured adjacent the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes. The monitor transmitting diode has optical properties that are at least mostly similar to those of the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes. The communication module includes at least one driver device for generating a biasing current and a modulation current for the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes and for generating a biasing current and a modulation current for the monitor transmitting diode. The communication module includes at least one monitor device including a receiver device, a control device, and the monitor transmitting diode. The monitor transmitting diode generates a modulated optical signal. The receiver device detects the modulated optical signal, converts the modulated optical signal into a monitor signal, and transmits the monitor signal to the control device. The control device, as a function of the monitor signal transmitted by the receiver device, provides a first control signal to the driver device for setting the modulation current for the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes and for setting the modulation current for the monitor transmitting diode. The modulation current for the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes has a modulation amplitude. The modulation current for the monitor transmitting diode has a modulation amplitude that is smaller than the modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an added feature of the invention, the monitor transmitting diode has an operating characteristic curve with a linear range; and the modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the monitor transmitting diode is at a level causing the monitor transmitting diode to always be operated in the linear range of the operating characteristic curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an additional feature of the invention, the modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the monitor transmitting diode and the modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes differ by a constant factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another feature of the invention, the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes have a biasing current; and the monitor transmitting diode has a biasing current. The control device is for regulating the biasing current of the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes and for regulating the biasing current of the monitor transmitting diode. The control device includes a further control circuit for evaluating the monitor signal and for providing at least one second control signal to the driver device. The second control signal is for setting the biasing current of the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes and for setting the biasing current of the monitor transmitting diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further feature of the invention, the monitor transmitting diode is supplied with a pilot tone frequency that is lower than that of the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further added feature of the invention, there is provided, a safety device. The-monitor device includes a further monitor transmitting diode and a further receiver device. The further monitor transmitting diode generates a further modulated optical signal. The further receiver device converts the further modulated optical signal into a further monitor signal. The receiver device and the further receiver device are connected to the safety device. The safety device switches off the plurality of the parallel transmitting diodes if either the received monitor signal or the further monitor signal exceeds a threshold value signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further added feature of the invention, there is provided, an OR device having a first input and a second input. The safety device includes a comparator device having a first input, a second input, and an output. The safety device also includes a further comparator device having a first input, a second input, and an output. The monitor signal is applied to the first input of the comparator device. The further received monitor signal is applied to the first input of the further comparator device. The threshold value signal is applied to the second input of the comparator device and to the second input of the further comparator device. The output of the comparator device is connected to the first input of the OR device. The output of the further comparator device is connected to the second input of the OR device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is achieved by virtue of the fact that a separate transmitting diode is used for a monitor control circuit (monitor transmitting diode). The modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the monitor transmitting diode is smaller than the modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the transmitting diodes which transmit a data signal. Here, the monitor transmitting diode is adjacent to the transmitting diodes for the transmission of data and has identical, or largely similar opto-electronic properties. The modulation amplitude for the transmitting diodes can thus be set by controlling and setting the modulation amplitude of the monitor transmitting diode for the monitor circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A significant advantage that is achieved with the invention in comparison with the prior art is that, by using the smaller modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the monitor transmitting diode, an interfering influence of the monitor signal on the transmitting diodes is prevented, and as a result an interfering influence on their optical output as a result of crosstalk of the monitor signal is prevented. The monitor signal forms an interference source if the transmitting diodes and the monitor transmitting diode are arranged in spatial proximity, for example, on a common substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the inventive solution is that the transmitting diodes can also be overmodulated, i.e. can be operated with an operating current below the threshold current, while the modulation of the current for the monitor control circuit or the monitor transmitting diode, which of course has a smaller modulation amplitude, can be carried out in the linear range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> By using separate transmitting diodes for the monitor circuit, which are not optically coupled to the communication channels of the transmitting diodes, a pilot tone signal can be generated and evaluated in the monitor circuit independently of the data signals for the transmitting diodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A modulation amplitude within the sense of the invention should be understood as the amplitude that is defined by the HIGH level and the LOW level of a digital data signal. It is an amplitude swing. As a laser is usually activated with a power source (the output power is proportional to the current), a current is modulated and a modulation amplitude is present on the modulation current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A preferred refinement of the invention provides for the modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the monitor transmitting diode to be so low that the monitor transmitting diode can always be operated in the linear range of the operating characteristic curve. As a result, the influence of non-linearities and resulting errors during the monitoring and control of the optical output of the transmitting diodes is avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An advantageous refinement of the invention provides for the modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the monitor transmitting diode and the modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the transmitting diodes to differ by a constant factor. As a result, the modulation amplitude for the transmitting diodes can be generated using a simple amplifier circuit from the modulation amplitude for the monitor channel. A correspondingly enlarged modulation current can then be fed to the transmitting diodes. The desired modulation amplitude is therefore monitored and controlled by the monitor circuit. The modulation amplitude that is set for the monitor circuit or the monitor transmitting diode is then fed, after multiplication by a constant factor, to the transmitting diodes which transmit the data signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The monitor transmitting diode is advantageously supplied with a pilot tone frequency that is lower than that of the transmitting diodes. Because of the use of a separate transmitting diode for the monitor circuit, the corresponding pilot signal is completely independent of the data signals to be transmitted. The modulation amplitude of the pilot signal is registered by the monitor device and is controlled to a stable level by the control device. The modulation amplitude for the transmitting diodes is then obtained by multiplying the modulation amplitude for the transmitting diodes by a constant factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> An advantageous development of the invention provides for the control device to control an average output power (or the biasing current) of the transmitting diodes, and for the at least one monitor transmitting diode to include a further control circuit. The signal that is received by the receiver device is evaluated by the further control circuit and the further control circuit provides at least one second control signal to the driver device for setting the biasing current of the transmitting diodes and the monitor transmitting diode. There is thus a further control possibility of the optical output power of the transmitting diodes based on the monitor signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one development of the invention: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> the monitor device includes a further monitor transmitting diode and a further receiver device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> a further modulated optical signal, generated by the further monitor transmitting diode, is converted into a further monitor signal by the further receiver device; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> the receiver device and the further receiver device are connected to a safety device which switches off the transmitting diodes if the received monitor signal and/or the further received monitor signal exceed a threshold value signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As a result, a safety device with a redundant design is provided for monitoring the transmission power of the optical output of the transmitting diodes. Two monitor channels are formed which each include a transmitter device and a receiver device and which are used independently of one another to monitor the safety of the optical output of the transmitting diodes. The upward transgression of the predefined settable threshold value signal, i.e. a specific average optical output power in one of the monitor channels leads to the transmitting diodes switching off. Even when a monitor channel fails, for example, because of a functional fault, the optical output of the transmitting diodes for the upward transgression of the threshold value signal can be monitored and an improved protection against overmodulation of the transmitting diodes is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If the transmitting diodes are embodied as laser diodes, overmodulation can lead to the emission of light waves whose intensity causes damage to other components or to people. Furthermore, overmodulation can lead to the transmitting diodes themselves being destroyed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is advantageously possible to provide that: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> the safety device includes a comparator device and a further comparator device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> the received monitor signal is applied to an input of the comparator device and the further received monitor signal is applied to an input of the further comparator device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> the threshold value signal is applied to another input of the comparator device and to another input of the further comparator device; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> an output of the comparator device and an output of the further comparator device are connected to an input or to a further input of an OR device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As a result, the safety monitoring of the optical output of the plurality of transmitting diodes is a redundantly implemented cost-effectively using simple circuit devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a communications module having-parallel transmitting diodes, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a communications module for optical waveguide equipment. The communications module includes a plurality of transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that are each connected to a driver circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The driver circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is used to generate the d.c. and a.c. signals that are necessary to operate the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. These are, in particular, the biasing current for the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> onto which a modulation current which is modulated in accordance with the data to be transmitted is superimposed. The respective driver circuits <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected in parallel to two outputs <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of a control device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The communications module also includes two monitor channels or pilot tone channels that have a monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a receiving diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and a further monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a further receiving diode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the monitor transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are arranged on a common substrate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. They are adjacent to one another and have identical or largely similar electro-optical properties. Because of the uniformity of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the monitor transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, by controlling the optical output power of the monitor transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> using the monitor channels or pilot tone channels, it is also possible to control the optical output power of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are preferably laser diodes that emit radiation vertically with respect to the surface of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An optical signal that is emitted by the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and that is received by the receiving diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is converted into a monitor signal and transmitted to the control device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The current (monitor signal) that is generated by the receiving diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> represents the output power of the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. For evaluating the received monitor signal, the control device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a control circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a further control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The control circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> serves to set the modulation amplitude of the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and thus of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, the modulation amplitude of the modulation current Imod of the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is controlled. The further control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> serves (by controlling the biasing current I<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>) to set the average optical output power of the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and thus of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A first control signal which is transmitted to the respective driver circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, via a first output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is generated using the control circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A modulation amplitude for the modulation current of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed (a.c. actuation) in the respective driver circuits <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using the first control signal. The modulation amplitude for the modulation current of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is smaller than the modulation amplitude for the modulation current of the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the monitor channel. Using the further control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the received monitor signal is evaluated in such a way that a second control signal is generated and can be transmitted to the respective driver circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a second output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The second control signal is processed in the respective driver circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order to set an average optical output power of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (d.c. actuation I<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The received monitor signal is thus used to control the modulation amplitude of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and to control the average output power of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The monitor signal has a frequency that is lower than the data signals of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. It is included, for example, of a 101010 . . . pattern. In the control circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, for example: the d.c. component is subtracted from the monitor signal registered by the receiving diode, the actual value is compared with a setpoint value of the modulation amplitude, and a pilot signal with a changed modulation amplitude is generated in accordance with the deviation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the receiving diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the further receiving diode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are connected to inputs <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of comparator devices <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Another input <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the comparator devices <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected in each case to a comparison source (not illustrated) which generates a threshold value signal and transmits it to the other inputs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If the monitor signal received using the receiving diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or the further receiving diode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> exceeds the threshold value signal, at least one of the comparator devices <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> transmits a signal to a logic OR device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which processes this signal in such a way that a switch-off signal is transmitted to the respective driver circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the further operation of the plurality of transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, of the transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and/or of the further transmitting diode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is interrupted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Using the transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the further transmitting diode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the receiving diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the further receiving diode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a redundant design is provided which ensures that, even when one of the monitor channels fails, it is possible to monitor the optical output of the plurality of transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Such a redundant design can, of course, also be used with known communications modules in which the transmission modulation amplitude of the optical output of the plurality of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not controlled on the basis of the received monitor signal, as described above. Irrespective of this described method of controlling the transmission modulation amplitude on the basis of the evaluation of the monitor signal, the advantages of the redundant design are also obtained in conjunction with known communications modules which do not have the novel redundantly designed monitor channels. The communications module can be characterized by two monitor channels that are independent of one another and that each include a transmitter device and a receiver device. Failure of one of the two monitor channels leads to the switching off of a plurality of transmitting diodes of the communications module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the profile of a modulation current Imod for the transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> also shows a modulation current k&times;Imod that has been amplified by the factor k for the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an operating characteristic curve B of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. During the operation of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, they are set to a point on the operating characteristic curve B using a d.c. current (biasing current) I<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. The optical output of the plurality of transmitting diodes is then modulated with a modulation current <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the basis of this setting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the modulation amplitude of the amplified modulation current k&times;Imod is higher than the modulation amplitude of the current Imod. The modulation amplitude of the modulation current of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is obtained here by multiplying the constant factor k against the modulation amplitude of the modulation current Imod of the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This has the advantage that the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can also be overmodulated, i.e. can be operated with an operating current below a diode threshold current of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. It is simultaneously assured that the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is operated in a linear range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The modulation amplitude of the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which are used for the data transmission, is controlled by supplying the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with a monitor signal (preferably low frequency). The output power of the monitor transmitting diode is registered by the receiving diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and is fed to the control device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The amplitude or the modulation amplitude of the monitor current Imod for the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and thus the modulation amplitude of the optical power of the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are set to a desired value in a stable fashion by the control circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The modulation current for the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is derived from the controlled modulation amplitude for the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed by multiplying the modulation amplitude of the modulation current for the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by a specific factor k which is greater than 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The control of the biasing current I<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>or of the average optical output power of the diodes is also carried out by the monitor channel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> using the further control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Here, the actual value of the average optical output power in the control device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is compared with a setpoint value and the biasing current for the monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is correspondingly set. The monitor transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are operated here with the same biasing current so that by controlling the biasing current of the monitor transmitting diodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the biasing current of the transmitting diodes is also controlled. It is to be noted that according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the further monitor transmitting diode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is used only for the additional monitoring of the biasing current for the safety device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. However, it is even possible also to apply Imod to this monitor signal and also to feed the monitor signal to the control device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or to a further control device. </paragraph>
