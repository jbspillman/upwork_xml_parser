<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a machine for processing tobacco bales or slices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Currently, in lines for processing tobacco at the manufacturing level, raw tobacco bales are broken up by means of a process that is commonly known as slicing and direct conditioning process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The tobacco bales, once freed from their packaging, depending on their dimensions may be subjected to slicing, so as to reduce them to dimensions that are compatible with the machines designed to process them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The tobacco slices or intact bales are then conveyed to a known type of machine, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, which is conveniently constituted by a frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that is shaped like a cylinder or a rotating drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This known type of machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for processing tobacco bales or slices must break them up, heat the resulting intermediate product, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, to the intended temperature, maintain its temperature for a preset time, known as transit time, and finally humidify the intermediate product until a preset level of humidity is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The cylindrical frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rotates about its own axis, which is conveniently inclined downward so as to allow the simultaneous advancement of the tobacco inside the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The tobacco is moved by means of a plurality of radial rods, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which protrude inside the cylinder and are suitable to lift the intermediate product <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The product, once it has reached a position that is proximate to the upper end of the cylinder, falls back, forming a downward stream <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which by way of the inclination of the axis falls in a more advanced position along the axis of the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In these conventional machines <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> there are provided, at one or both ends of the cylindrical frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, one or more nozzles, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which are adapted to introduce steam or atomize water by means of steam or compressed air (using therefore two paired nozzles) so as to both humidify and heat the intermediate product <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The nozzles <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are advantageously constituted by double water/steam or water/compressed air nozzles, in which the gaseous element is designed to atomize the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is advantageously provided with an external duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which comprises a fan <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and is adapted to generate a current of air that flows, inside the cylinder, in equicurrent or countercurrent with respect to the flow of tobacco, so as to render the humidification and/or heating of the intermediate product <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as uniform as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In these conventional machines <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the transit speed and therefore the retention time of the tobacco are determined first of all by the degree of inclination of the drum-like or cylindrical frame <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and by the speed at which the air and the steam or water are introduced at the ends of the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Depending on all of the above variables, a curve is generated which characterizes the behavior of the temperature in the environment inside the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> For optimum treatment of the tobacco, this temperature should have a behavior that has a peak at the input end, a subsequent constant behavior up to 80-85% of the length of the cylinder, and finally a decrease in the temperature in the output region, where an injection of conditioning water is usually provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The main drawback of these conventional tobacco processing machines <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is that the direct conditioning systems with which they are equipped, described briefly above, often perform a scarcely effective humidification and/or heating of the intermediate product <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In particular, it is very difficult to control the behavior of the temperature curve along the axis of the cylinder: the injection of the steam, which it the primary cause of the heating of the tobacco, causes only at the ends of the drum-like frame a heating that is characterized by two temperature peaks located at the input and output of the cylinder and by a central trough that covers most of the length of said cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The current of optionally preheated air, which should convey steam and water along the entire extension of the cylinder, is in practice scarcely effective in equalizing the temperature behavior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it worsens the drawback constituted by the difficulties in controlling the transit time of the tobacco inside the machine, since it acts differently depending on the characteristics of the tobacco being treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In particular, the transit time can be altered by the air stream due to the different density of the tobacco, since there is a greater or smaller propulsion effect (in the case of an equicurrent air stream) or a greater or smaller slowing or retention effect (in the case of a countercurrent air stream) depending on the greater or lower lightness of the tobacco. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Another drawback consists in that the weight and consistency of the tobacco in transit cause a variation in the transit speed also as a function of the number and arrangement of the nozzles <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for the injection of the steam and water from the ends of the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> More specifically, injection at the loading end tends to increase the advancement speed of the intermediate product, while injection at the unloading end tends to retain the tobacco inside the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Some conventional machines <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be equipped with mechanical means adapted to adjust the transit speed according to the quality and characteristics of the tobacco; however, such mechanical means are highly ineffective, since they assume a control of the rotation rate or inclination of the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Actually, the inclination of the axis is usually fixed, and even if it were made variable it could not be adjusted continuously and at the same time effectively in order to cope with the sometimes rapid behavior variations that depend on the quality of the product being treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the range available for varying the speed of the cylinder is very limited, since in order to properly form the falling stream <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> the product must fall from a rather narrow region of the upper end of the cylinder, designated by the angle &agr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As a partial remedy to the above-described drawbacks, machines for treating tobacco are known which are designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> and have a device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for injecting steam and water that is advantageously constituted by one or more tubes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> arranged inside the cylindrical frame, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The tubes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are supported at their free ends and have, along part or all of their length, suitable nozzles <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for injecting steam, so as to achieve an injection direction that is approximately perpendicular to the advancement direction of the intermediate product, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the influence of the steam injection on the transit speed is reduced and at the same time the use of an air current for entrainment along the axis of the cylinder is rendered substantially unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The tubes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are usually arranged in the opposite position with respect to the product fall region, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> One drawback of conventional machine <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is the fact that it is often difficult to insert one or more tubes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which are necessary of the self-supporting type, along the entire length of the frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which can in some cases exceed ten meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Another important drawback is that the radial rods, generally designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which protrude inside the cylinder and are designed to move and lift the intermediate product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, force to place the tubes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so that they are far from the internal surface of the cylinder, in order to avoid interference with the rods <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Due to the length of the rods <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, therefore, the tube <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> cannot be placed in the position that is most convenient to allow optimum steam injection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another severe problem can be due to the continuous impact between the tobacco slices or bales and the tubes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which can lead to an excessive mechanical stress of said tubes and therefore to consequent malfunctions or breakdowns of said machine <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A further drawback of the conventional machines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is that leaves or strips of tobacco, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, can straddle said one or more tubes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and remain there until they are removed by chance by additional incoming intermediate product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or until the machine is cleaned at the end of the production cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the first case, the tobacco retained by the tube <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is humidified excessively, and its return to the main stream of intermediate product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates a critical quality problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the second case, instead, a possibly considerable quantity of intermediate product is wasted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> There are known mechanical means for limiting the straddling of the leaves or for cleaning the tube <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> continuously, such as for example periodic or continuous rotation of the tube, the arrangement of rotating cleaning brushes, usually located above the tube, or the arrangement of curved tile-shaped protections above the tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> However, all these mechanical means are very complicated and scarcely effective and require considerable maintenance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> With reference to the figures, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> designates a machine for processing tobacco bales or slices, advantageously constituted by a frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which is advantageously cylindrical, conveniently hollow and arranged so that its axis is slightly inclined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has, at its free ends, a tobacco input region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an output region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for a intermediate product, which is designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>; in particular, the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is inclined so that the output region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is located at a lower level than the input region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> rotates about its own axis so as to allow the intermediate product <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to move toward the output region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> During its rotation, the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> also breaks up the tobacco bales or slices, advantageously through suitable movement means, which in this particular embodiment are constituted by multiple rods <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that protrude radially inside the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The machine <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> further comprises humidification and/or heating means, which are advantageously obtained by way of steam feeder means, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which are preferably formed at the rods <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The rods <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are in fact conveniently perforated axially, so as to obtain respective nozzles, one of which is designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> At the first free end, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, of each rod <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> it is possible to use individual or double nozzles, depending on the type of fluid to be injected into the intermediate product <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> At a second free end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which lies opposite the first one, the rods <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are associated with, or rigidly coupled to, the internal surface <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at respective holes, not shown, for connection to a duct <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a tube <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated by way of example in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the machine <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> has six tubes <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, which are arranged longitudinally around the outer surface of the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in mutually equidistant positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Such tubes are advantageously fed by means of a single manifold, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which is arranged annularly with respect to the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, for example proximate to the output region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The machine <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can advantageously comprise means for temporarily and selectively deactivating the steam feeder means <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, so as to allow to inject the steam predominantly from the nozzles <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> arranged in an approximately lateral position, thus avoiding injection in alignment with the direction of the falling stream of tobacco, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> To prevent the alteration of the falling motion that this would entail, it is therefore convenient to prevent the injection of steam into the falling stream <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> by the feeder means <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that are arranged proximate to the tobacco release region, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and optionally also of the feeder means that are arranged in the diametrically opposite position, termed fall region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the means for temporarily and selectively deactivating the steam feeder means <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> consists in providing, along the tubes <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, flow control valves, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which can be activated conveniently by way of means adapted to temporarily interrupt the outflow of steam, such as for example a mechanical cam-based actuation system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In particular, at valves <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, externally to the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, an annular cam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is provided, which is rotatably associated perimetrically with the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and has a radially arranged raised portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The annular cam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, by acting on a roller, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, that is mounted on the moving part of the valve <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, causes the closure of such valves at the release region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and at the fall region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, or in any case in the regions where the injection of steam is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The tubes <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> for feeding water or steam can be connected to the nozzles <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> according to schemes that are different from the one described above, depending on the most convenient functional model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The feeding of the tubes <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, during the rotation of the machine <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, is ensured by a rotary connector, designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which is preferably arranged along the rotation axis of the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, for example proximate to the output region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of the rods <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be the most appropriate according to requirements; such arrangement can provide, for example, for an alignment thereof along multiple straight lines or along helical generatrices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the particular illustrated arrangement, a particularly simple feeding system for the feeder means <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has been chosen in which each row of rods <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is fed by a single tube <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> arranged outside the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Operation is therefore as follows: as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the tobacco bales and slices, conveniently shredded into leaves and strips of intermediate product <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, are lifted by the rods <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> up to the fall region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> During the fall, the falling stream of tobacco <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> forms and is struck by the steam or optionally by the water that exits from the feeder means <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Such spraying occurs predominantly on the two sides of the falling stream <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, not from above or below, thanks to the presence of the deactivation means, which are constituted by the annular cam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and by the valves <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> It has thus been observed that the present invention has achieved the intended aim and objects, a tobacco processing machine having been devised which allows to provide optimum humidification and/or effective heating of the intermediate product uniformly along the entire length of the cylindrical frame, independently of the density or lightness of said intermediate product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The invention further allows to differentiate the amount of steam or water injected in the different parts of the length of the cylinder, so as to allow to control the shape of the temperature curve and divide the cylinder into a plurality of regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> This differentiation can be achieved easily by means of a chosen connection of the rods to the feeder tubes, or in another manner by adapting the dimensions of the injection nozzles to specific requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The injection of the steam along the falling stream of tobacco further occurs on both sides thereof, with a consequent great improvement in the efficiency of the machine and in the quality and uniformity of the output intermediate product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Finally, the cleaning steps at the end of the production cycle are more simple and rapid, since it is possible to use the rods to inject the cleaning water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The invention is of course susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Thus, for example, it is possible to feed the steam feeder means by way of tubes <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> formed monolithically with the wall of the frame <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, by means of conventional construction technologies, such as so-called double-skin cylinders. It is also possible to provide for an arrangement of said rods in which said rods are more densely packed at one or more preset regions or to provided, even more advantageously, for a different distribution of the flow-rate of steam or water emitted by said rods, so as to perform a chosen treatment for said tobacco. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The materials employed, as well as the dimensions that constitute the individual components of the present invention, may of course be the more pertinent according to specific requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The disclosures in Italian Patent Application No. TV2001A000086 from which this application claims priority are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
