<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a ball screw rack assist type electric power steering apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Steering systems of automobiles widely use a so-called power steering apparatus for assisting a steering operation by use of an external power source. the power source for the power steering apparatus has hitherto involved the use of a hydraulic pump, and this hydraulic pump is driven by the engine in many cases. This type of power steering apparatus has, however, a large power loss (on the order of several through ten horsepower (HP) at a maximum load) of the engine because of driving the hydraulic pump at all times and is therefore hard to apply to mini-sized motor vehicles exhibiting small displacements. Even the automobiles having comparatively large displacements, when installed, come to have such an inevitable demerit that their running fuel economy becomes low enough not to be negligible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Such being the case, an electric power steering (which will hereinafter be abbreviated to EPS) involving the use of an electric motor as a power source has attracted the attention over the recent years for obviating those problems. The EPS apparatus exhibits characteristics, wherein there is no direct drive loss of the engine because of using a battery loaded into the car as a power source for the electric motor, a decrease in the running fuel economy is restrained as the electric motor is started only when assisting the steering operation, and in addition the precise electronic control can be extremely easily performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, for a steering gear mechanism for a passenger car, a rack-and-pinion steering gear is mainly employed at the present, since the rack-and-pinion gear has high rigidity performance and low in weight. Then, the EPS apparatuses for the rack-and-pinion steering gear include a column assist type in which the electric motor is arranged sideways of the column in order to drive a steering shaft and a pinion itself, and in addition a ball screw rack assist type in which a rack shaft is driven by an electrically-driven ball screw mechanism. In the ball screw rack assist type EPS apparatus (which will hereinafter be simply called the rack assist type EPS apparatus), the assist force does not act on a meshing surface between the pinion and the rack, and therefore a contact surface pressure between these two members, which is to be a factor for abrasion and deformation as well, is relatively small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the rack assist type EPS apparatus, a ball screw shaft male thread groove formed in a rack shaft engages with a female thread groove formed in a ball nut through a multiplicity of circulation balls (steel balls), and the ball nut is rotated by the electric motor, thereby moving the rack shaft in the axial directions. A power transmission method for transmitting the power from the electric motor to the ball nut may be a timing belt system disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No.6-49489 etc, however, a general method is a gear system disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication Nos.5-14939 (a first prior art) and 2-46455 (a second prior art) etc. In case of the conventional rack assist type EPS apparatus, if low of an assembly accuracy of the respective parts constituting the ball screw mechanism and the rack and pinion mechanism, a misalignment occurs between the ball nut and the rack and pinion pair. In this case, so-called distortions are formed between the ball nut and the rack shaft, with the result that a smooth movement of the rack shaft is hindered. This hindrance of the smooth movement might cause a loss of driving force, an abnormal abrasion and, besides, noises when operated. Further, if the working accuracy and the assembly accuracy of the housings that accommodate and hold the ball screw mechanism and the electric motor, are low, a backlash occurs between the gear pair connecting the ball nut and the electric motor together, and the noises are likewise emitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Such being the case, each of the rack assist type EPS apparatuses according to the first and second prior arts adopts an aligning mechanism for supporting the ball nut so as to be swayable about the housing through a spherical bearing in order to obviate a misalignment between the ball nut and the rack shaft. Large increases in the number of manufacturing processes and in the costs for the product are, however, inevitable for providing the spherical bearing between the housing and the ball nut. Moreover, the spherical bearing utilizes the slide on between the metal members, and hence, if a comparatively large load acts, a predetermined aligning operation is not obtained due to a rise in slide friction force, with the result that the misalignment is not obviated in the great majority of cases. Further, if the ball nut is supported on the spherical bearing, a central position of the ball nut remained unchanged, so that the backlash between the gears is not, as a matter of course, canceled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Generally the ball nut configuring the ball screw mechanism is structured so that a rolling bearing (a double-row angular ball bearing etc) is fitted on and made integral with the ball nut body. The ball nut is fixed by a ring bolt or a C-shaped stopper ring brought into contact with an outer ring of the rolling bearing within the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the conventional rack assist type EPS apparatus, the C-shaped stopper ring comes off and falls out of an engagement groove formed in the housing, or the ring bolt slackens and falls out due to a careless operation in the assembly and vibrations when driving. In this case, since the ball nut moves in an axial direction by dint of an external force, a proper axial force can not be given to the rack shaft. This results in an extremely unagreeable feeling of the steering and in an impossibility of performing the precise steering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to the rack assist type EPS apparatus adopting the gear type power transmission method, an idle gear is interposed between the gear on the electric motor and the gear on the ball nut in order to avoid an increase in diameter of each of these two gears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the rack assist type EPS apparatus, the gear train for the power transmission, the ball screw mechanism and the bearing for supporting the ball nut, have hitherto been lubricated by respective lubricants (normally greases) for exclusive uses therefor. Hence, in this type of EPS apparatus, three or four pieces of shaft seals are attached to side portions etc of the gear portion of the ball nut, thereby preventing the lubricants from being mixed. If many shaft seals are thus used, a large friction loss occurs when the ball nut rotates, there are caused a loss of driving torque and an unagreeable feeling of the steering. Further, the steering gear case and the ball nut need high-precision working of seal seats and seal slide surfaces in order to accommodate and hold the shaft seals. This is a factor for increasing the costs for the product along with the rise in the number of components. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the first invention of the present application to provide a rack assist type electric power steering apparatus capable of improving an operability and canceling a backlash etc in a gear train of a driving system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the object given above, according to the first invention, an electric power steering apparatus comprises a ball nut rotationally driven by an electric motor through a gear train and having a female thread groove formed in the inner periphery thereof, a rack shaft disposed through said ball nut on the axis thereof and having a male thread groove so formed in its outer periphery as to face to the female thread groove of the ball nut, a ball screw mechanism having a number of circulation balls interposed between the female thread groove and the male thread groove, and a housing for holding the ball nut rotatably through the bearing, wherein elastic members are interposed between the housing and the ball nut in order to permit the ball nut to make a predetermined displacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the first invention, even if a misalignment occurs between the ball nut and the rack and pinion pair, the ball nut displaces with a deformation of the elastic member, thereby obviating the misalignment. Further, a backlash between the gears due to a defect in working of the housing and so on, is also canceled by biasing the ball nut in a direction right-angled to the axis with the elastic member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the second invention of the present application to provide an electric power steering apparatus capable of preventing a fall-out of a fastening element for fixing the ball nut and thus preventing a decline of a steerability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> To accomplish this object, according to the second invention, an electric power steering apparatus comprises a ball nut rotationally driven by an electric motor and having a female thread groove formed in the inner periphery thereof, a rack shaft disposed through the ball nut on the axis thereof and having a male thread groove so formed in its outer periphery as to face to the female thread groove, a number of circulation balls interposed between the female thread groove and the male thread groove, a housing for holding the ball nut rotatably, and a fastening element for fixing the nut to the housing, wherein the electric power steering apparatus is provided with a fall-out preventing mechanism for preventing the fastening element from falling out off within the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to the second invention, the fastening element does not come off the housing, and hence, even if the fastening element comes off and slackens, the ball nut does not move in excess of the predetermined range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Further, in the electric power steering apparatus according to the second invention, the housing may be constructed of a first housing accommodating the ball nut and the fastening element and a second housing fixed to the first housing, and the fall-out preventing mechanism may be a fastening element contact member, formed on the second housing, for regulating the fastening element from moving in the fall-out direction. With this contrivance, the fall-out preventing mechanism is formed simply by fastening integrally the first housing and the second housing to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the electric power steering apparatus according to the second invention, the fastening element may be a stopper ring fitted to the first housing, and an interval between the stopper ring and the fastening element contact member may be, in an assembled state, set smaller than a thickness of the stopper ring. This scheme prevents the stopper ring, even if on the verge of coming off due to a careless operation etc when assembled, from completely falling out because of coming into contact with the fastening element contact member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the electric power steering apparatus according to the second invention, the fastening element may be a ring bolt helically fitted to the first housing, and an interval between the ring bolt and the fastening element contact member may be, in an assembled state, set smaller than an effective helical-fitting length of the ring bolt to the first housing. With this contrivance, the ring bolt, even when slackening due to the vibrations etc during driving, comes into the contact with the fastening element contact member and is thereby prevented from completely falling out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the third invention of the present application to provide a rack assist type electric power steering apparatus capable of reducing a friction loss when operating and the number of components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the above object, according to the third invention, a rack assist type electric power steering apparatus comprises a ball nut rotationally driven by an electric motor, a ball screw mechanism interposed between the ball nut and a rack shaft, and a bearing for rotatably supporting the ball nut, wherein the ball screw mechanism and the bearing share a lubricant with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Further, in the rack assist type electric power steering apparatus according to the third invention, it is preferable that a power transmission mechanism be interposed between the electric motor and the ball nut, and the power transmission mechanism, the ball screw mechanism and the bearing share the lubricant with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the rack assist type electric power steering apparatus according to the third invention, the power transmission mechanism may be a gear type power transmission mechanism or a chain type power transmission mechanism or a belt type power transmission mechanism or a friction roller type power transmission mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the third invention, there is no necessity for the shaft seal, whereby the friction loss caused by the rotations of the ball nut decreases, and the enhanced feeling of the steering is attained. Besides, the decreases in the number of working processes for the steering gear case etc and in the number of components, lead to the considerable reduction in the costs for the product.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the first invention, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an elastic bush <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> composed of an elastic member such as a synthetic rubber etc is interposed between the ball nut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the bearing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The elastic bush <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is formed with a cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> on which an inner race <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the bearing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is fitted, and with flange members <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> at both ends of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An operation in the first embodiment of the first invention will hereinafter be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When a driver rotates the steering wheel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a rotational force thereof is transferred to the steering gear mechanism <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the upper steering shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the lower steering shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The steering gear mechanism <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a built-in rack-and-pinion mechanism for converting the rotational input into a rectilinear motion. With this mechanism, the rack shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> moves in any one of the right and left directions, and a steering angle of the wheels changes through the right and left tie rods <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, thus performing a steering operation. On this occasion, within the power assist mechanism, the electric motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, based on an output of an unillustrated steering torque sensor, rotates with a predetermined rotational torque in a forward or reversed direction, and the rotations thereof are decelerated and thus transferred to the ball nut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> via the driven gear <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Upon rotations of the ball nut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a thrust force acts on the male thread groove <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the rack shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through the steel balls <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> fitted in the female thread groove <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, thereby attaining a steering assist force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the first invention, the ball nut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is held by the bearing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> through the elastic bush <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and therefore, even if somewhat a misalignment occurs between the ball nut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the rack shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> due to lacks of working accuracy and assembling accuracy with respect to the parts, this misalignment is absorbed by a displacement of the ball nut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, thereby restraining a loss of driving force and abnormal abrasions of the respective portions. Further, the ball nut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is so set as to be biased toward the electric motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by the elastic bush <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. With this setting, even if a backlash occurs between the drive gear <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the driven gear <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, this backlash is absorbed, and no noises are emitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an enlarged sectional view showing principal portions of the steering gear in a second embodiment of the first invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an enlarged sectional view showing principal portions of the steering gear in a third embodiment of the first invention. Each of the second and third embodiments takes substantially the same whole structure as in the first embodiment discussed above, and their operations and effects are the same as those in the first embodiment, however, differences therebetween are a configuration of the elastic bush and a position where this bush is disposed. To be specific, according to the second embodiment, a couple of elastic bushes <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are interposed respectively between the ball nut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and both ends of the inner race <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the bearing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, thus scheming to improve an assembly workability etc. Further, according to the third embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the couple of elastic bushes <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are interposed between a ball screw housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and an outer race <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the bearing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, whereby the ball nut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the bearing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> make integral displacements with respect to the ball screw housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The explanations of the specific embodiments of the first invention, which have been discussed so far, come to an end, however, the mode of the first invention is not limited to the embodiments discussed above. For instance, the electric motor and the ball nut are connected by use of the couple of spur gears and may also be connected by three or more gears including an idle gear or by a helical gear train. Further, the motor shaft of the electric motor and the central axis of the ball nut are not necessarily disposed in parallel, and it follows that they become orthogonal in the case of combining a worm wheel with a pinion and using a bevel gear etc. Moreover, the configurations, from the shape of the elastic member and the whole construction of the steering gear down to the structure of the power assist mechanism, are not confined to the exemplifications in the embodiments discussed above, and can be, if within the range that does not depart from the concept of the present first invention, properly changed based on requests in terms of designs and specifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the electric power steering apparatus according to the first invention includes the ball nut rotationally driven by the electric motor through the gear train and having a female thread groove formed in the inner periphery thereof, the rack shaft disposed through the ball nut on the axis thereof and having a male thread groove so formed in its outer periphery as to face to the female thread groove, the ball screw mechanism having the plurality of circulation balls interposed between the female thread groove and the male thread groove, and the housing for holding the ball nut rotatably through the bearing. In the thus constructed electric power steering apparatus, the elastic members are interposed between the housing and the ball nut in order to permit the ball nut to make the predetermined displacement. Therefore, even if the misalignment occurs between the ball nut and the rack shaft, the ball nut displaces owing to deformations of the elastic members, thereby canceling this misalignment. In addition, the backlash caused between the gears due to a defect in working of the housing etc is also obviated by biasing the ball nut in the direction right-angled to the axial direction with the elastic members. </paragraph>

Further, a ball nut <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> provided with the driven gear <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> at its end is rotatably held in the ball screw housing <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. The ball nut <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is constructed of a ball nut body <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and a double-row angular ball bearing <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> fitted on the ball nut body <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The double-row angular ball bearing <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is structured such that steel balls <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> are interposed in two rows between a couple of inner races <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and an outer race <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, wherein the inner races <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> are secured by a stopper ring <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> fitted on the ball nut body <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. With this structure, the ball nut body <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is integrated with the double-row angular ball bearing <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The rack shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed with a male thread groove <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, while the ball nut body <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is formed with a female thread groove <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. A number of steel balls <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> serving as the circulation balls are interposed between the male thread groove <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and the female screw groove <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the ball nut body <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is fitted with circulation pieces (not shown) for assisting the circulation of the steel balls <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the second invention, the ball screw housing <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> has an annular groove <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> formed in along its inner peripheral surface on the side of the gear housing <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. An outer peripheral portion of a C-shaped stopper ring <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> fixedly engaging with the outer race <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the double-row angular ball bearing <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is fitted in this annular groove <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>.

Then, an interval t (between the fastening element contact member <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and the left end surface, as viewed in the Figure, of the annular groove <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>) between the fastening element contact member <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and the C-shaped stopper ring <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>, is set significantly smaller than a thickness B of the C-shaped stopper ring <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> An operation of the first embodiment of the second invention will hereinafter be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> On the occasion of assembling the steering gear mechanism <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, an assembler fits the ball nut <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> into the ball screw housing <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, and thereafter prevents a shift of the ball nut <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> by fitting the C-shaped stopper ring <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> into the annular groove <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the second invention, the clearance t between the fastening element contact member <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and the left end surface, as viewed in the Figure, of the annular groove <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is set smaller then the width B of the C-shaped stopper ring <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the C-shaped stopper ring <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> from falling out of the ball screw housing <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> With this contrivance, according to the first embodiment of the second invention, even if unexpected load is applied to the nut and C-shaped stopper ring <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> comes off from the groove of housing, the ball bearing could not move in axial direction, and the steer function is secured. </paragraph>

The second embodiment of the second invention also adopts the same whole construction as in the first embodiment of the second invention, however, the ball nut <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> (the double-row angular ball bearing <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>) is secured by a ring bolt <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. Then, an interval t&prime; between the fastening element contact member <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> provided on the gear housing <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the ring bolt <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, is set significantly smaller than an effective helical fitting length <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the ring bolt <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and the ball screw housing <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the case of this second embodiment, the ring bolt <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, even when slackening due to vibrations etc during driving, does not fall out because of its end surface being contact-engaged with the fastening element contact member <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>. Consequently, as in the first embodiment of the second invention, the quantity of axial shift of the ball nut <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is regulated at the maximum t&prime;, with the result that the unagreeable feeling of the steering etc does not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The specific embodiments, which have been discussed so far, comes to an end of their explanations, however, the mode of the second invention is not limited to the first and second embodiments described above. For instance, according to the embodiments discussed above, the rotations of the electric motor are transmitted via the gear to the ball nut and may also be transmitted thereto via a belt. Further, in the embodiments discussed above, the component of the ball nut involves the use of the double-row angular ball bearing, however, a double-row tapered roller bearing, a slide bearing etc may also be used. Moreover, the fastening element of the ball nut may involve the use of elements excluding the C-shaped stopper ring and the ring bolt, and the mechanism for preventing the fall-out of the fastening element may involve the use of members other than the fastening element contact member provided on the gear housing. Furthermore, the whole configuration of the steering gear and the structure of the power assist mechanism are not limited to the exemplifications in the embodiments discussed above, and can be, if within the range that does not deviate from the concept of the second invention, properly changed based on requests in terms of designs and specifications. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of the third invention does not use the shaft seal for preventing a mixture of the grease in the conventional apparatus, and hence a friction loss caused by the rotations of the ball nut <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> decreases, thereby enhancing the feeling of the steering. Further, neither the gear housing <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, nor the ball screw housing <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> nor the ball nut <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> needs working a seal seat or seal slide surface for the shaft seal, whereby the costs for the product remarkably decreases along with no use of the shaft seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The specific embodiment of the third invention, which has been discussed so far, comes to an end of its explanation, however, the mode of the third invention is not limited to the embodiment described above. For example, in the embodiment discussed above, what has been exemplified as the power transmission mechanism is the gear type power transmission mechanism including the single idle gear, however, a chain type power transmission mechanism or a belt type power transmission mechanism or a friction roller type power transmission mechanism may also be adopted, and there can be also applied a so-called coaxial type power transmission mechanism in which the ball nut is integrated with the rotor of the electric motor. Further, the double-row angular ball bearing has been exemplified as the bearing, however, other types of bearing may also be used. Further, solid-state lubricants and greases other than lithium soap grease are, if capable of meeting the conditions such as a lubricating performance, a durability etc, usable as the lubricant. For others, the whole configuration of the steering gear, the structure of the power assist mechanism and so on can be, if within the range that does not deviate from the concept of the third invention, properly changed based on requests in terms of designs and specifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, according to the third invention, the rack assist type electric power steering apparatus includes the ball nut rotationally driven by the electric motor, the ball screw mechanism interposed between the ball nut and the rack shaft, and the bearing for rotatably supporting the ball nut. In the thus constructed electric power steering apparatus, the ball screw mechanism shares the lubricant with the bearing, which eliminates the necessity for the shaft seal, and so on. Owing to the above-mentioned, the friction loss caused by the rotations of the ball nut decreases, and the enhanced feeling of the steering is attained. Besides, the decreases in the number of working processes for the steering gear case etc and in the number of components, lead to the considerable reduction in the costs for the product. </paragraph>
