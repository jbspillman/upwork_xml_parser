<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a transportation vessel for transporting a closed vessel, or a so-called canister, containing radioactive substance that involves heat release, and a method of loading the closed vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Highly radioactive substances represented by spent fuels from nuclear reactors are reprocessed in order to recover plutonium or some other useful substances that can be used again as fuels. The highly radioactive substances are contained before they are reprocessed. In this case, the spent fuels are put into canisters in a nuclear power plant, and the canisters are transported, in transportation vessels or so-called transportation casks, by ship or truck to a containing facility. Since the spent fuels are highly radioactive, the transportation casks containing them are expected to have high sealing and shielding properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Usually, the canister comprises a tubular metallic vessel body closed at the bottom and a basket located in the vessel body. A plurality of spent fuel assemblies are sealed in the vessel body in a manner such that they are supported by means of the basket. A top opening of the vessel body is closed by means of a primary lid and a secondary lid that are welded together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In general, a transportation cask comprises an open-topped cask body formed of a metal such as stainless steel or carbon steel and a neutron shield, which is formed of a high-molecular material or synthetic resin, for example, and covers the outer periphery of the vessel body. A top opening of the cask body is closed by a bolted lid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In transporting the canister in the transportation cask from a power plant to a desired facility, the spent fuel is contained in the canister and then in the transportation cask by the following processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> First, in a decontamination pit, the empty vessel body of the canister is put into the transportation cask with its upper end open, and preparations are made for fuel loading. The basket is set in advance in the vessel body. Subsequently, the transportation cask, having the vessel body therein, is transferred to a cask loading pit filled with cooling water, and is immersed in the cooling water. Thereupon, the canister and the cask are filled with the cooling water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the cask loading pit, the spent fuel assemblies, having so far been contained in a spent fuel pit, are pulled out one after another by means of a pit crane and loaded in succession into the basket in the vessel body. After a given number of spent fuel assemblies are loaded into the vessel body, the shielding plate is fitted into the top opening of the vessel body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the transportation cask is pulled up from the cask loading pit and transferred to the decontamination pit by means of an overhead traveling crane. In the decontamination pit, a suitable quantity of cooling water is discharged from the vessel body so that the surface of the cooling water in the cask is situated slightly above the spent fuel assemblies, and water in the gap between the canister and the transportation cask is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> After the primary lid is welded to the vessel body of the canister to close its opening, in this state, complete dehydration, vacuum drying, inert gas replacement, sealing operation, welding portion inspection, and air leakage inspection are carried out. Further, the secondary lid is welded, and inert gas replacement in the space between the primary and secondary lids, sealing operation, welding portion inspection, and air leakage inspection are carried out. Thus, seal-welding operation for the lids of the canister is finished, whereupon the canister is completed contained the spent fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the top opening of the transportation cask is closed by means of a lid, and a pre-transportation check is conducted, whereupon pre-shipment preparations are completed. Then, the transportation cask, thus containing the canister, is transported from a power plant to a containing facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In loading the spent fuel assemblies into the canister, in the transportation cask constructed in this manner, the canister surface and the inner surface of the transportation cask are also brought into contact with the cooling water and contaminated with radioactivity. In any stage before the transportation, therefore, the canister must be loaded again into the transportation cask after it is temporarily drawn out of the cask to have its outer surface washed and checked for contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Thus, the operation for loading the canister into the transportation cask is very troublesome. In raising the canister from or loading it into the transportation cask, moreover, there is a possibility that the canister will fall by mistake, resulting in damage to the canister and the transportation cask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Usually, the primary and secondary lids of the canister are checked for the welding state by an ultrasonic sensor or the like after they are welded. In this case, however, the canister is contained in the transportation cask, and the gap between the outer surface of the canister and the inner surface of the transportation cask is narrow. Accordingly, the welding portion can be inspected only from above the canister, so that it is hard to check up on the welding state accurately. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been contrived in consideration of these circumstances, and its object is to provide a transportation vessel, capable of preventing contamination of the outer surface of a canister as a radioactive substance and the canister are loaded and simplifying the loading operation, and a loading method for a closed vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, a transportation vessel according to an aspect of the invention is a vessel for contained and transporting a closed vessel, which comprises a substantially tubular metallic vessel body, having a closed bottom and a top opening and configured to contain radioactive substance, and a lid welded to the vessel body and closing the top opening of the vessel body. The transportation vessel comprises: a body having a top opening and provided inside with a containing portion configured to contain the closed vessel; a lid closing the top opening of the body; and a ring-shaped seal member provided between the outer surface of the closed vessel and the inner surface of the body, near the top opening, and configured to seal the gap between the outer surface of the closed vessel and the inner surface of the body and to prevent a fluid from getting into the gap between the outer and inner surfaces through the top opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A method of loading a closed vessel with a radioactive substance into a transportation vessel, according to another aspect of the invention, comprises: locating an empty vessel body with an opened top of the closed vessel in the containing portion of an open-topped body of the transportation vessel; sealing the gap between the outer surface of the vessel body and the inner surface of the body by means of a ring-shaped seal member provided between the outer surface of the vessel body and the inner surface of the body, near the top opening of the body, thereby preventing a fluid from getting into the gap between the vessel body and the inner surface of the body through the top opening; immersing the body containing the vessel body in water in a state such that the gap between the outer surface of the vessel body and the inner surface of the body is sealed by the seal member; loading a radioactive substance into the vessel body in the water; setting a shield member in the top opening of the vessel body in the water after loading the radioactive substance; pulling up the body from the water after setting the shield member and then discharging a given quantity of water from the vessel body and the body; and welding the lid to the inner surface of the vessel body after discharging the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the transportation vessel constructed in this manner and the loading method, the fluid can be prevented from getting into the gap between the vessel body of the closed vessel and the inner surface of the body through the top opening of the body by sealing the gap between the vessel body and the inner surface of the body by means of the ring-shaped seal member that is provided between the outer surface of the vessel body and the inner surface of the body near the top opening. Thus, in immersing the body, containing the vessel body of the closed vessel, in the water to set the radioactive substance in position, the water can be prevented from flowing into the gap between the vessel body and the inner surface of the body through the top opening of the body. In consequence, the outer surface of the vessel body can be prevented from being contaminated with the water. Accordingly, the closed vessel can be washed without being pulled up from the body of the transportation vessel. Thus, there may be provided a transportation vessel and a closed vessel loading method such that the radioactive substance and the closed vessel can be loaded with ease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out hereinafter.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A transportation cask according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment comprises a substantially cylindrical body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, formed of stainless steel, carbon steel, or some other metal, an outer tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> coaxial with the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and constituting the outer surface of the cask, and a neutron shielding layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of a high-molecular material that contains hydrogen, for example. The neutron shielding layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided between the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the outer tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and serves as a neutron shield. The body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has its upper end open and its lower end closed by means of a bottom wall <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that is welded to it. Thus, a containing portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed in the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for use as a closed vessel is contained in the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the containing portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Further, spent fuel assemblies as radioactive substances are contained in the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a substantially cylindrical vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is closed at the bottom and has a top opening <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed of a metal such as stainless steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has an outside diameter a little smaller than the inside diameter of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and can be inserted into the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A plurality of spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are sealed in the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in a manner such that they are supported by a basket <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The basket <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed of a composite material that combines boron and aluminum or SUS. The spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are formed of a spent fuel from a nuclear reactor, for example, and contain a radioactive substance that involves heat release attributable to decay heat and generation of radiation. The canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a weld-sealed structure to prevent the sealed radioactive substance from leaking out. Further, the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is filled with helium gas under a negative or positive pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A plurality of support blocks <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, e.g., four in number, are fixed on the inner peripheral surface of the upper end portion of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The support blocks <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are arranged at equal spaces in the circumferential direction. A disk-shaped shielding plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> overlies the support blocks <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with a ring-shaped support plate between them, thereby closing the top opening of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Further, a disc-shaped primary lid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is lapped on the shielding plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the top opening <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thereby closing the top opening of the vessel body. The topside part of the outer peripheral portion of the primary lid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is welded to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, covering the whole circumference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a disc-shaped secondary lid <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is lapped on the primary lid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the top opening <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The topside part of the outer peripheral portion of the secondary lid <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is welded to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A plurality of recesses <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are formed on the inner surface of the secondary lid <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The whole inner surface of the secondary lid <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> except the recesses <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is in intimate contact with the upper surface of the primary lid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> These recesses <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> define closed spaces that serve as inspection spaces for monitoring between the primary and secondary lids <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The closed spaces are kept at a negative or positive pressure inside. Thus, a pressure barrier is defined between the inside and outside of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, so that the closed state can be monitored and the airtight leakage inspection can be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As described above, the top opening <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is hermetically closed by means of the shielding plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, primary lid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and secondary lid <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The shielding plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, primary lid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and secondary lid <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are formed of a metal such as stainless steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the aforementioned construction is contained coaxially in the containing portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and placed on the bottom wall <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In this state, a narrow gap is formed between the outer peripheral surface of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the inside diameter of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a little greater than the outside diameter of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The upper end portion of the containing portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed having an inside diameter greater than that of the remaining portion, so that the containing portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is stepped. Thus, an annular inspection space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the insertion of a tester is formed in the upper end portion of the containing portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The inspection space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is situated around the upper end portion of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, that is, outside the primary and secondary lids <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A ring-shaped elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for use as a seal member is located in the inspection space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which is formed of rubber, for example, can be inflated by being externally supplied with compressed air. The tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is fixed to the inner peripheral surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and is liquid-tightly in contact with the inner peripheral surface of the body and the outer peripheral surface of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the inspection space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thus, the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> seals the gap between the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the outer surface of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing a fluid from getting into the gap between the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the top-opening side of the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> One or more supply holes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are formed penetrating the outer periphery of the upper end portion of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and open into a space that is sealed by means of the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment, the supply holes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> open into the inspection space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> under the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The fluid can be supplied from outside the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the space between the outer surface of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is sealed by means of the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Normally, each supply hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is closed by a plug <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the top opening of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is closed by means of a lid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is formed of a metal such as stainless steel or carbon steel. The lid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fastened to the upper end face of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by bolts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The inner surface of the lid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is intimately in contact with the outer surface of the secondary lid <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Further, the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided with shock absorbers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that are attached to the upper and lower end portions of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, respectively. The shock absorbers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are substantially disc-shaped members of wood, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The shock absorber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fitted on and screwed to the upper end portion of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and covers the whole outer surface of the lid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the shock absorber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is fitted on and screwed to the lower end portion of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and covers the whole outer surface of the bottom wall <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of a method for setting the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> constructed in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In a decontamination pit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is put into the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with its upper end open. In this stage, the shock absorbers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the lid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are removed. Further, the basket <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is placed in advance in the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the compressed air is supplied to the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that is fixed to the inner surface of the upper end portion of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thereupon, the tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is inflated and brought intimately into contact with the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the outer periphery of the upper end portion of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. By doing this, the gap between the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the outer surface of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is sealed by the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Thus, the fluid is prevented from getting into the gap between the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the top-opening side of the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Further, a gas such as uncontaminated air from outside the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is filled into the space between the outer surface of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is sealed by the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and each supply hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is closed by the plug <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Thus, the space that is sealed by the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is filled with air, and the pressure in this space is kept at a level equal to or higher than external pressure, whereby penetration of the fluid can be prevented more securely. Thereupon, preparations for fuel loading are finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The filled fluid is not limited to air, and may be any other gas or a liquid such as pure water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, containing the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, is transferred to a cask loading pit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> filled with cooling water <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by means of an overhead traveling crane, and is immersed in the cooling water, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. Thereupon, the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the upper end portion of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are filled with water. As this is done, there is no possibility of the contaminated cooling water <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> flowing into the gap between the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through the top opening of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, since the space between the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the outer surface of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is sealed by the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and filled with air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the cask loading pit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, having so far been contained in a spent fuel rack <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a spent fuel pit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, are pulled out one after another by means of a pit crane <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and loaded in succession into the basket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. After a given number of spent fuel assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are loaded into the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the support plate and the shielding plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are fitted successively into the top opening <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is pulled up from the cask loading pit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and transferred to the decontamination pit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by means of the overhead traveling crane. In the decontamination pit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a suitable quantity of cooling water is discharged from the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that the surface of the cooling water <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is situated slightly above the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this state, the primary lid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is set in the top opening <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the peripheral edge portion of the upper end of the primary lid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is welded to the inner surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, whereupon the top opening of the vessel body is closed. After the welding operation, the tester, e.g., an ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, is inserted into the inspection space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the top opening of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and located outside the welding portion of the primary lid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is used to check the welding portion of the primary lid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for its welding state in a direction substantially perpendicular to the welding portion or the outer peripheral surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, from the outside of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The tester is not limited to the ultrasonic sensor, and an electromagnet sensor or any other tester may be used for the purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, complete dehydration of the interior of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, vacuum drying, inert gas replacement, sealing operation, welding portion inspection, and air leakage inspection are carried out. Then, the secondary lid <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is set in the top opening <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and its outer peripheral edge portion is welded to the inner surface of the vessel body. Thereafter, the welding state of the secondary lid <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is inspected by means of the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the same manner as aforesaid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, inert gas replacement in the space between the primary and secondary lids <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, sealing operation, welding portion inspection, and air leakage inspection are carried out. Thus, seal-welding operation for the lids of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is finished, whereupon the canister is completed contained the spent fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> After the top opening of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is closed by the lid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the outer surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is washed. Further, the plug <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is removed, and the air or pure water, having so far filled the aforesaid sealed space, is discharged. Finally, after the shock absorbers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are attached to the upper and lower ends of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, respectively, a pre-transportation check is conducted, whereupon pre-shipment preparations are completed. Then, the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thus containing the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is transported by truck or ship from a power plant to a containing facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> According to the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> constructed in this manner, the gap between the outer surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sealed by means of the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that is provided between those surfaces near the top opening of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By doing this, the fluid can be prevented from getting into the gap between the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the top opening of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, in immersing the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, containing the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in the cooling water <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to set the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in position, the cooling water can be prevented from flowing into the gap between the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the top opening of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In consequence, the outer surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be prevented from being contaminated with the cooling water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In immersing the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, containing the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in the cooling water to set the radioactive substance in position, according to the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the aforementioned construction, moreover, a fluid such as air or pure water is injected in advance into the sealed space through the supply holes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. By doing this, the contaminated cooling water can be prevented more securely from getting into the aforesaid space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Thus, there may be provided a transportation cask and a loading method such that loading operation can be easily performed without the necessity of pulling up the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and washing it after it is loaded with the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The welding time can be shortened in a manner such that the welding portion is cooled with air supplied through the supply holes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as the primary and secondary lids are welded to the vessel body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is fixed to the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. If the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> falls as it is loaded into or pull up from the containing portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, therefore, its falling speed can be considerably lowered by the elastic tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Thus, the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be prevented from being damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to the transportation cask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> constructed in this manner, the annular inspection space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is defined between the upper end portion of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the upper end portion of the vessel body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or some other tester can be inserted into the inspection space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to check the welding portions of the primary and secondary lids <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for the welding state in the direction perpendicular to the welding portions. Thus, the welding state of the primary and secondary lids <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be inspected securely, and the reliability of the welding can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For example, the ring-shaped seal member for preventing the penetration of the fluid is not limited to the elastic tube, and may alternatively be a solid member of an optional material that can be selected as required. </paragraph>
