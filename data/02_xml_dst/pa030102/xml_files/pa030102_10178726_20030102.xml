<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hip joint operation robot system, and in particular to a robot mounting apparatus for a hip joint operation robot which are capable of firmly attaching the hip joint operation robot to a femur in order for the hip joint operation robot to perform an accurate femoral canal cavity operation, and a hip joint operation robot system using the same. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, an artificial joint is formed of an acetabular portion and a femur portion. The above femur portion includes a ball engaged with the acetabular portion, a stem inserted into a human&apos;s femur and a neck for connecting the stem and the ball. Here, the acetabular portion is formed of an abrasion resistance material like a polyethylene. The femur portion is formed of a certain material like a metal or ceramic. However, the acetabular portion and the femur portion may be made of the same ceramic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a joint operation, when an artificial joint which is formed of the above material and has the above structure is engaged with a human&apos;s femur having a cortical bone or a porous bone and a bone cavity therein, since the stem of the artificial joint must be properly engaged with the femur, the femur must have a longitudinal femoral canal cavity therein of which the diameter and length correspond to those of the engaged stem. The operation in which the stem of the artificial joint is engaged to the femur will be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1F</cross-reference> are views for describing a manual operation of the hip joint operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When a reamer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is stated to inserted into the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> engaged with a hip joint, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, and is inserted by a certain depth in a longitudinal direction of the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, and is removed from the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C, a</cross-reference> reamer insertion femoral canal cavity <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed in the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D through 1E</cross-reference>, when a broach <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having the same shape as that of an artificial joint is inserted into the reamer insertion femoral canal cavity <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is excavated or formed in the same shape as the broach <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Here, in the drawing, reference numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> represents a bone removing portion formed in the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the broach <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> At this time, it is impossible to accurately form a femoral canal cavity in the femur by a manual operation in order for the position and size of the same to be accurately matched with those of the artificial joint. Therefore, when the artificial joint operation is manually performed, the artificial joint may not be properly or accurately engaged with the femur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to improve the above problems which occur due to the manual work in which the artificial joint is engaged to the femur, a femur is machined using an operation robot. The femur operating by the robot will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a view illustrating a prior art robot operation system which includes an operating table <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, an operation robot <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> fixedly installed in an operating room or operating table for thereby performing an operation of a patient <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a computer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> connected with the operation robot <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for controlling an operation performed by the operation robot <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Here, in the drawings, dotted line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> represents a work space in which the operation robot <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> works during the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the above robot operation system, since it is possible to accurately process the shape of the femoral canal cavity to match with the shape of the artificial joint compared to the operation in which the femoral canal cavity is processed by a manual method, it is possible to accurately engage the artificial joint to the femoral canal cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, since the prior art robot operation system has a big volume and is fixedly installed in a floor of the operating room or the operating table, it cannot be moved one place to another. In addition, as indicated by the dotted line of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the prior art operation system has a large workspace. Also, the prior art robot system needs an additional system for detecting a position of a corresponding bone before the operation and an apparatus for preventing the femur from being moved during the operation, thereby the prior art robot operation system is expensive and is not widely used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a view illustrating the construction of a hip joint operation robot system according to the present invention. The hip joint operation robot system includes an operating table <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, an operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for performing an operation with respect to a patient <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on the operating table <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a robot mounting apparatus <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> which is engaged to a femur of the patient <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and stably and fixedly installs the hip joint operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> thereon so that the hip joint operating robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> performs accurately an artificial joint operation near a corresponding operation portion of the femur, and a computer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> electrically connected with the robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for controlling the robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to perform the artificial joint operation. In the drawings, dotted line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>represents a workspace in which the operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> reaches during the operation. In the present invention, the workspace is relatively smaller than that of the prior art robot system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the hip joint operation robot system, the robot mounting apparatus <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for installing the operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and being fixed to the femur will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a perspective view illustrating the robot mounting apparatus for a hip joint operation robot according to the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the robot an mounting apparatus according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown therein, the robot mounting apparatus <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for a hip joint operation robot includes a fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for surrounding and clamping a femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a clamp adjusting unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> for controlling the fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that the fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> stably seize the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is positioned near an end portion of the femur in the side of the hip joint and installs the operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> thereon, and a link <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which has an end connected with the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by a first engaging member <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and the other end connected with the fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by a second engaging member <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is constructed in such a manner that the operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is fixedly installed thereon. The robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed like a Korean character, &lsquo;<custom-character file="US20030004516A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00001"/>&rsquo;, which is read as &lsquo;Digeut&rsquo;, or a bracket shape &lsquo;&lsqb;&rsquo;, so that the operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> performs an operation in a stable state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In addition, the fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are assembled at a predetermined angle with respect to the link <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. At this time, the installation angle of the same may be adjusted and then fixed. The first and second engaging members <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are fixing the link <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, like a engaging manner such as a ball&plus;slider engagement, a slider&plus;slider engagement, a ball&plus;socket engagement, or hinge&plus;hinge engagement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be engaged with the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at various angles, so that the operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> performs an operation of the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the patient at the optimum angle. Namely, when the link and/or fixing clamp and/or the robot installation unit are adjusted with predetermined angles each other with respect to corresponding engaging members therebetween, the corresponding engagement members fixed the link and/or fixing clamp and/or the robot installation unit to each other in order to maintain the predetermined angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> installs the operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> thereon and then fixes the same using a predetermined engaging unit (not shown). We can easily appreciate that the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be integrally formed with the operation robot as one integrated body as another preferred embodiment of the present invention. Namely, since a measurement reamer position must be measured with respect to the robot before the operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> performs an operation, the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> installs the operation robot which may be separatably fixed. However, if an apparatus is used for measuring the position of the measurement reamer position with respect to the robot, the robot installation unit may be integrally formed with the operation robot as one integrated body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Also, even though, the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed like a Korean character, &lsquo;<custom-character file="US20030004516A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00002"/>&rsquo;, which is read as &lsquo;Digeut&rsquo;, or a bracket shape &lsquo;&lsqb;&rsquo; in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, so that the operation robot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> performs an operation in a stable state, we can easily appreciate that the robot installation unit may be formed in a certain shape such as a plate shape or modified shape therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiments of the present invention, even though the fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is a Roman clamp, we can easily appreciate that a fixing apparatus having a seizing unit at its one end may be adapted like an adhesive, screw, and other elements having the same function. In addition, the fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may further include a certain engaging unit (not shown) capable of moving and fixing the link <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In addition, the robot mounting apparatus for a hip joint operation robot according to the present invention has a dimension of 15 cm each in horizontal, vertical and height sides, and the hip joint operation robot system using the robot mounting apparatus has a dimension of 15 cm each in horizontal, vertical and height sides. Therefore, the volume of the hip joint operation robot system is relatively smaller than that of the prior art operation robot system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The artificial joint operation using the robot mounting apparatus for a hip joint operation robot and a hip joint operation robot system using the same according to the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> First of all, in order to start an artificial joint operation, a surgical doctor cuts a tissue <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of a patient&apos;s leg and pelvis and slightly pulls out a femur. Next, the fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> stably attaches to the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At this time, since the fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is installed inside the tissue <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the fixing clamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is not exposed to the outside of the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is installed. At this time, the distance, direction and angle between the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the femur <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are freely and optimally adjusted by the link <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the engaging member <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> After the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is installed, the measurement reamer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is inserted into the bone cavity of the femur bone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a relative position between the measurement reamer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the robot installation unit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is measured, and then the measurement reamer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is removed. Thereafter, the robot is stably and fixedly installed on the robot installation unit. At this time, the relative position with respect to the femur of the operation robot is not changed irrespective of the movement of the femur. When the operation robot is installed based on the above method, in a state that the position of the operation robot is in a stable state, a femoral canal cavity which is accurately matched with the size and diameter of the artificial joint which will be inserted thereinto, is formed in the femur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Next, the artificial joint is inserted into the femoral canal cavity which is accurately formed in the femur, so that the artificial joint is accurately fixed at a desired position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As described above, since the robot mounting apparatus for a hip joint operation robot according to the present invention has a small and simple structure and is capable of stably fixing the position of the operation robot with respect to an operating portion, the operating robot performs the operation accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In addition, the robot mounting apparatus for a hip joint operation robot according to the present invention is fixed only to the femur, not to a certain portion of the system such as the operating table or a floor of the operation room, the operation robot system is movable, and the volume of the same is significantly decreased. In addition, since the operation robot performs an operation in a relatively decreased space with respect to the operating portion of the patient, it is possible to decrease the workspace of the robot system. Furthermore, the operation robot accurately performs the operation irrespective of the movement of the femur while the operation robot performs an operation. </paragraph>
