<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An apparatus for discriminating a color format comprises signal processing paths, a direct signal path, a relay device, a detection device, a discrimination device and a control device. The signal processing paths separate a luminance signal and a color signal form a broadcasting signal based on a plurality of color formats. The direct signal path provides a direct output of the broadcasting signal without separating the luminance signal and the color signal therefrom. The relay device selectively relays the broadcasting signal as inputted to any one of the respective signal processing paths and the direct signal path. The detection device detects variation of the color format of the broadcasting signal based on an output signal from the signal processing paths. The discrimination device discriminates the color format of the broadcasting signal based on the broadcasting signal as inputted through the direct signal path. The control device controls the relay device so as to relay the broadcasting signal to the direct signal path, when variation of the color format is detected by means of the detection device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There have conventionally been known receiving apparatus such as a television receiver, which is compatible to a broadcasting signal in accordance with a plurality of color formats such as the NTSC format system and the PAL format system. In such a receiving apparatus, it is necessary to discriminate the color format of the broadcasting signal as received and execute the signal processing in accordance with the corresponding color format. In the conventional receiving apparatus, the predetermined color format, for example the NTSC format system has been set as the signal processing mode so that a receiving step is continued without converting the color format into the other format when the normal signal processing can be conducted. When the normal signal processing cannot be conducted, it is discriminated the type of color format with which the broadcasting signal as received has been processed, based on signals after demodulation in accordance with the NTSC format system. The color format of the broadcasting signal is discriminated and a switching operation of the receiving apparatus is carried out to execute the signal processing in accordance with the discrimination results, thus permitting to cope with the plurality of color formats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the conventional method, the color format of the broadcasting signal as being received is discriminated on the basis of resultant signals (i.e., color signals), which have been obtained after completion of separation of the luminance signal and the color signal from the broadcasting signal in accordance with the prescribed color format. As a result, much time is required to carry out the discrimination step of the color format, thus making it difficult to conduct a rapid stitching operation corresponding to the color format. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Now, an embodiment of an apparatus of the present invention for discriminating a color format will be described in detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The apparatus of the embodiment of the present invention for discriminating the color format is provided in a receiving apparatus in which a plasma display panel is used as a display panel. However, the present invention is not limited only to display utilizing the plasma display panel and to application to the receiving apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus of the embodiment of the present invention for discriminating a color format, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating operation of the apparatus of the embodiment of the present invention for discriminating the color format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the color format discriminating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the embodiment of the present invention comprises a switch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for switching the paths for a broadcasting signal as received, an NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for separating the luminance signal and the color signal from the broadcasting signal in accordance with the NTSC format system, a PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for separating the luminance signal and the color signal from the broadcasting signal in accordance with the PAL format system, a color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for discriminating the color format of the broadcasting signal and a microcomputer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for controlling the respective units of the color format discriminating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the switch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is controlled by means of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, has a contact &ldquo;a&rdquo; connected to a path for relaying the broadcasting signal to the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a contact &ldquo;b&rdquo; connected to a path for relaying the broadcasting signal to the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a contact &ldquo;c&rdquo; connected to a direct signal path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is directly connected to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The output signal (i.e., the color signal) from the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inputted to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The switch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be an electronic switch having no mechanical structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with the first discrimination unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second discrimination unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The first discrimination unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> discriminates as whether or not the broadcasting signal has been received and the signal inputted to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is stable. The second discrimination unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> discriminates the color format as inputted to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> controls the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The discrimination results from the first discrimination unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the second discrimination unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the color format discrimination unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are sent to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Now, description will be given below of operation of the color format discriminating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the embodiment of the present invention with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The microcomputer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> executes the processing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A switching-on operation of the receiving apparatus, which is provide with the color format discriminating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the embodiment of the present invention, for example causes the processing to start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When the processing starts, it is judged as whether or not the broadcasting signal has been received in Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An affirmative judgment in Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> causes the system to enter Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A negative judgment in Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> causes Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be repeated. The switch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is kept in a state a switching element is connected to the contact &ldquo;a&rdquo; or the contact &ldquo;b&rdquo; in Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the output signal from the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be inputted to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. It is judged in Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as whether or not the broadcasting signal has been received, on the basis of the discrimination results from the first discrimination unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which receives the output signal from the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Here, judgment as whether or not the broadcasting signal has been received is made for example on the basis of existence of a synchronization signal in the output signal from the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Then, in Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, there is discriminated a frequency of a vertical synchronization signal, which is included in the signal that has been outputted from the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and then inputted to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Here, it is possible to make a provisional discrimination of the color format of the broadcasting signal as being received, on the basis of the vertical synchronization signal. For example, the frequency of the vertical synchronization signal of 50 Hz causes the color format to be provisionally discriminated as the PAL format system and the frequency thereof of 60 Hz causes the color format to be provisionally discriminated as the NTSC format system. Such discrimination results may provide the color format discrimination apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with operational effects. If the frequency of the vertical synchronization signal is 50 Hz, it is possible to prevent discrimination error relative to the signal having the different frequency of 60 Hz, by increasing the detection sensitivity in the PAL format system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it is judged as whether or not the broadcasting signal has been received stably. More specifically, it is judged as whether or not the broadcasting signal has been received stably, on the basis of discrimination results from the first discrimination unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which receives the output signal from the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Judgment in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> corresponds to judgment as whether or not demodulation adapted to the color format of the broadcasting signal as being received can be executed in an appropriate manner. More specifically, in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it is judged that the demodulation adapted to the actual color format of the broadcasting signal cannot be executed, when the broadcasting signal has not been received stably. Judgment on whether or not the broadcasting signal has been received stably can be made on the basis of whether or not a Y/C separation of the signal has been performed stably in accordance with a prescribed clock (e.g., the synchronization signal) in the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or whether or not the detection results of the color system have been stable in a prescribed period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A negative judgment in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causes the system to return to Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, the Y/C separation continues in the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is currently selected. An affirmative judgment in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causes the system to enter Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that the switching element in the switch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is switched to the contact &ldquo;c&rdquo;. As a result, the broadcasting signal is directly inputted to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the direct signal path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Then, in Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the color format is discriminated on the basis of the broadcasting signal, which is directly inputted to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the direct signal path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Here, the color format is discriminated on the basis of the discrimination results obtained by the second discrimination unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> More specifically, such discrimination is made on the basis of the frequency of the vertical synchronization signal (i.e., 60 Hz/50 Hz), the frequency of the color sub-area and phase of color burst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Judgment criteria for the discrimination results may be changed when turning on power, switching the inputting operation, switching external signals or switching an automatic discrimination mode. It is possible to increase, for example, the monitoring period of time for the discrimination results when turning on power, to prevent discrimination error before supply voltage becomes stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Then, in Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the switching operation of the switch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is carried out in accordance with the discrimination results in Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In case where the color format is discriminated for example as the NTSC format system in Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the switching operation of the switch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is carried out to switch the path of the broadcasting signal to the side (i.e., the contact &ldquo;a&rdquo;) of the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In case where the color format is discriminated for example as the PAL format system in Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the switching operation of the switch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is carried out to switch the path of the broadcasting signal to the side (i.e., the contact &ldquo;b&rdquo;) of the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As a result, there is selected the Y/C separation unit, which is adapted to the discrimination results in Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so as to carry out a demodulation step of the broadcasting signal in the color format discriminated in Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Then, in Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, it is judged as whether or not the color format of the broadcasting signal as being received changes, on the signal inputted to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Here, there are made the similar judgments to the judgment in Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the judgment in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. More specifically, in case where it is judged in the first discrimination unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that the broadcasting signal has not been received, and in case where it is judged in the first discrimination unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that the broadcasting signal has not been received stably, there is made a judgment that the color format has changed. When there is a state other than the above-mentioned states, there is made a judgment that the color format has not changed. Judgment on whether or not the broadcasting signal has been received stably can be made on the basis of whether or not a Y/C separation of the signal has been performed stably in accordance with a prescribed clock (e.g., the synchronization signal) in the NTSCY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PALY/C separation unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or whether or not the detection results of the color system have been stable in a prescribed period of time in the same manner as Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A negative judgment in Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> causes Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be repeated as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Selection of the same path by means of the switch is maintained during repetition of Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, so as to carry out a demodulation step in accordance with the same color format. An affirmative judgment in Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> causes the system to return to Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to judge as whether or not the broadcasting signal has been received. Then, the above-mentioned processing steps are repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the color format discrimination apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the embodiment of the present invention, in case where there is made a judgment (i.e., the affirmative judgment in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) that there has not been carried out a demodulation step adapted to the color format of the broadcasting signal as being received, the luminance signal and the color signal, which are obtained through the Y/C separation, are not inputted to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, but the broadcasting signal is directly inputted to the color format discrimination device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) so as to discriminate the color format of the broadcasting signal as being received, in the second discrimination unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). It is therefore possible to discriminate rapidly the color format in Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so as to make a rapid selection of a suitable signal processing path in Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, application of the color format discriminating apparatus of the present invention makes it possible to switch rapidly the display mode in an appropriate manner for example in the receiving apparatus, without displaying obstructive images when switching the color format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> According to the color format discriminating apparatus of the present invention as described in detail, in case where change in the color format is detected, the broadcasting signal is relayed to the direct signal path so as to discriminate the color format of the broadcasting signal in the discrimination device. It is therefore possible to discriminate rapidly the color format in the discrimination device. </paragraph>

<claim id="CLM-00001">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An apparatus for discriminating a color format comprising: 
<claim-text>a plurality of signal processing paths for separating a luminance signal and a color signal form a broadcasting signal based on a plurality of color formats; </claim-text>
<claim-text>a direct signal path for providing a direct output of the broadcasting signal without separating the luminance signal and the color signal therefrom; </claim-text>
<claim-text>a relay device for selectively relaying the broadcasting signal as inputted to any one of the respective signal processing paths and the direct signal path; </claim-text>
<claim-text>a detection device for detecting variation of the color format of the broadcasting signal based on an output signal from the signal processing paths; </claim-text>
<claim-text>a discrimination device for discriminating the color format of the broadcasting signal based on the broadcasting signal as inputted through the direct signal path; and </claim-text>
<claim-text>a control device for controlling the relay device so as to relay the broadcasting signal to the direct signal path, when variation of the color format is detected by means of the detection device. </claim-text>
