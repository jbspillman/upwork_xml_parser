<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a metallic closed vessel, or a so-called canister, in which a radioactive substance that involves heat release is sealed, a seal-welding method for the closed vessel, and an exhaust system used for the seal-welding method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Highly radioactive substances represented by spent fuels from nuclear reactors are destructured and reprocessed in order to recover plutonium or some other useful substances that can be used again as fuels. These spent fuels are contained in closed places before they are reprocessed. Known containing methods for these highly radioactive substances include a wet method that uses storage pools and the like and a dry method that uses casks and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The dry method is a containing method in which air is used in place of water for natural cooling. Since the running costs of the dry method are lower than those of the wet method, the dry method has started to attract attention and be developed. Known casks that are applicable to the dry method include metallic casks and concrete casks based on a concrete structure for shielding the spent fuel. Each of these casks is provided with a tubular vessel body that is closed at both ends, top and bottom. The spent fuel is sealed in a tubular metallic closed vessel or a so-called canister, moreover, the canister is put into the vessel body of the cask. Thus, radioactive substance can be contained in a shielded state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Usually, the canister comprises a tubular vessel body closed at the bottom and a lid that closes a top opening of the vessel body. A basket is located in the vessel body, and a plurality of spent fuel assemblies are sealed in the vessel body in a manner such that they are supported by the basket. Normally, the spent fuel assemblies are sealed into the canister in the following processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> First, the open-topped vessel body of the canister is immersed in cooling water and filled with the water. In this state, the basket and the spent fuel assemblies are contained in the vessel body. Thus, the spent fuel assemblies are temporarily shielded with the cooling water to prevent leakage of radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a primary lid is dropped onto the top opening of the vessel body to close it, and a suitable quantity of water is discharged. Thereafter, the primary lid is welded to the vessel body to seal the top opening of the vessel body. After the water is completely discharged from the vessel body through a drainage hole in the primary lid, the drainage hole is sealed. Further, a secondary lid is lapped onto the primary lid and welded to the vessel body. Thus, the resulting canister has the spent fuel assemblies well sealed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the sealing process for the canister described above, the vessel body is filled with the cooling water as the primary lid is welded to it, in order to intercept radiation from the spent fuel assemblies. However, the welding operation takes so much time that the cooling water in the vessel body is heated by the spent fuel assemblies and evaporated gradually. The resulting steam fills the vessel body and flows out of it through the gap between the inner surface of the vessel body and the primary lid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Normally, a welding operation is performed in a manner such that molten deposited metal naturally drops by the gravity, thereby forming penetration beads. As this is done, however, steam gets into the gap between the inner surface of the vessel body and the primary lid, as a welding portion, so that weld defects such as voids are inevitably formed in the welding portion. These weld defects lower the strength of the welding portion, and a radioactive substance leaks from the defective portions. Thus, it is hard to maintain the integrity or radioactive substance sealing performance of the canister. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been contrived in consideration of these circumstances, and its object is to provide a metallic closed vessel free from weld defects and high in sealability, a seal-welding method for the closed vessel, and an exhaust system used for the seal-welding method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, a closed vessel according to an aspect of the invention comprises: a substantially tubular vessel body closed at the bottom, having a top opening, and configured to contain radioactive substance; and a lid set in the top opening of the vessel body and welded to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The lid has an outer peripheral portion adjacently opposed to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body, the outer peripheral portion including a welding portion welded to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body and a space portion located on the bottom side of the vessel body with respect to the welding portion. The space portion is configured to be filled with a shield gas or to allow the flow of the shield gas therein so as to shield the welding portion from the interior of the vessel body, as the welding portion is welded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A closed vessel according to another aspect of the invention comprises: a substantially tubular vessel body closed at the bottom, having a top opening, and configured to contain radioactive substance; a shielding plate set in the top opening of the vessel body and closing the top opening; a seal member for sealing a gap between the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body and the shielding plate; and a lid set in the top opening of the vessel body so as to be lapped on the shielding plate and having a peripheral edge portion welded to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body. The lid has an outer peripheral portion adjacently opposed to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body, the outer peripheral portion including a welding portion welded to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body and a space portion located on the bottom side of the vessel body with respect to the welding portion. The space portion is configured to be filled with a shield gas or to allow the flow of the shield gas therein so as to shield the welding portion from the interior of the vessel body, as the welding portion is welded </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the closed vessel for a radioactive substance constructed in this manner, steam can be prevented from getting into the welding portion by filling into or running the shield gas through the space portion of the lid as the lid means is welded. Thus, the lid can be securely welded without involving any weld defects that are attributable to steam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Since the gap between the shielding plate and the vessel body is sealed, moreover, steam can be more securely prevented from getting into the welding portion through the gap as the lid means is welded. In consequence, the lid means can be securely welded without involving any weld defects that are attributable to steam. Thus, the resulting closed vessel provides improved integrity and high radiation shielding properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A seal-welding method for a closed vessel configured to contain radioactive substance according to still another aspect of the invention comprises: filling water into a substantially tubular vessel body closed at the bottom and having a top opening; placing a radioactive substance in the vessel body and immersing the substance in the water; setting a lid in the top opening of the vessel body to close the top opening; evacuating the vessel body through a discharge hole formed in the lid and discharging steam generated in the vessel body to the outside, while charging air into the vessel body through the discharge hole; and welding a peripheral edge portion of the lid to the vessel body, thereby sealing the top opening of the vessel body, while discharging the steam to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A seal-welding method for a closed vessel according to a further aspect of the invention comprises: filling water into a substantially tubular vessel body closed at the bottom and having a top opening; placing a radioactive substance in the vessel body and immersing the substance in the water; setting a shielding plate in the upper end portion of the vessel body to close the top opening, and sealing a gap between the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body and the shielding plate by means of a seal member; setting a lid in the top opening of the vessel body to be lapped on the shielding plate, thereby closing the top opening; evacuating the vessel body through a discharge hole formed in the lid and the shielding plate and discharging steam generated in the vessel body to the outside, while charging air into the vessel body through the discharge hole; and welding the peripheral edge portion of the lid means to the vessel body, thereby sealing the top opening of the vessel body, while discharging the steam to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the seal-welding method for a closed vessel of the invention, moreover, the lid has an outer peripheral portion adjacently opposed to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body, the outer peripheral portion including a welding portion welded to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body and a space portion located on the bottom side of the vessel body with respect to the welding portion, and a shield gas is filled into or run through the space portion, thereby preventing the steam from getting into the welding portion, as the lid means is welded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the seal-welding method for a closed vessel described above, the vessel body is evacuated to discharge steam as the lid is welded, whereby the steam can be prevented from getting into the welding portion. Thus, the lid can be securely welded without involving any weld defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Further, the steam can be more securely prevented from getting into the welding portion in a manner such that the shield gas is filled into or run through the space portion of the lid as the lid is welded. The resulting closed vessel enjoys high closeness and satisfactory radioactive substance sealing properties without involving any weld defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an exhaust system according to the invention comprises: a charging pipe configured to be passed through the discharge hole and having a charging port opening into the vessel body and a suction port opening to the outside of the vessel body; an exhaust pipe located in the charging pipe to form a double-pipe structure and having an exhaust port opening into the vessel body and an extending portion extending to the outside of the vessel body; and a suction device connected to the extending portion of the exhaust pipe and configured to evacuate the vessel body through the exhaust pipe and charge the open air into the vessel body through the charging pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to the exhaust system constructed in this manner, the vessel body can be simultaneously exhausted and charged by using the one discharge hole. More specifically, the air containing steam in the vessel body is discharged through the exhaust port by means of the suction device, and in concert with this, air is charged into the vessel body through the charging pipe, whereby the internal pressure of the vessel body is regulated. Thus, the steam that is generated in the vessel body can be discharged from the vessel body, so that a large quantity of steam can be prevented from getting into the welding portion. Even though radiation from the radioactive substance is intercepted by means of the water during the welding operation, therefore, satisfactory circumstances can be enjoyed without involving any voids in the welding portion, and improvement of the welding accuracy can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out hereinafter.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A canister according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a canister <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for use as a metallic closed vessel comprises a substantially cylindrical vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that is closed at the bottom and has a top opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed of a metal such as stainless steel. A plurality of spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are sealed in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a manner such that they are supported by a basket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. These spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are formed of a spent fuel from a reactor, for example, and contain a radioactive substance that involves heat release attributable to decay heat and generation of radiation. The canister <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a weld-sealed structure to prevent the contained radioactive substance leaking out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> More specifically, a plurality of support blocks <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, e.g., four in number, are fixed on the inner peripheral surface of the upper end portion of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The support blocks <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are arranged at equal spaces in the circumferential direction. A ring-shaped support plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is placed on the support blocks <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The support plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has an outside diameter substantially equal to the inside diameter of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A disc-shaped shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is placed on the support plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, thereby closing the top opening of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A groove is formed on the outer peripheral portion of the lower surface of the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, covering the whole circumference. Fitted in this groove is an O-ring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of a heat-resistant elastic material, such as ceramics, for use as a seal member. The O-ring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is in intimate contact with the upper surface of the support plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and airtightly closes the gap between the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A disc-shaped primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is lapped on the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the top opening of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thereby closing the top opening of the vessel body. The topside part of the outer peripheral portion of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is welded to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, covering the whole circumference. The shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are formed having a discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which is used to discharge air and water form the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and feed air into the vessel body, as mentioned later. The discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is sealed by means of a plug <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that is fixed to the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Further, a groove is formed covering the whole circumference of the outer peripheral portion of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and is situated below a welding portion. This groove defines a space in which a shielding gas is filled or run during welding operation, as mentioned later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A disc-shaped secondary lid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is lapped on the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the top opening of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The peripheral edge portion of the topside of the secondary lid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is welded to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, the secondary lid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> closes the top opening of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The secondary lid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a plurality of protrusions <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on its lower surface, which are directly in contact with the upper surface of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Thus, the top opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is airtightly closed by the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and secondary lid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and secondary lid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are formed of a metal such as stainless steel.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of a method for loading the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the canister <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> constructed in this manner and a seal-welding method for the lids of the canister. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In a decontamination pit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the canister <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is put into a transportation cask <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> in a manner such that its upper end is open, whereupon preparations are made for fuel loading. The basket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is set in advance in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the transportation cask <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, having the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> therein, is transferred to a cask loading pit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> filled with cooling water <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by of an overhead traveling crane (not shown), and is immersed in the cooling water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the cask loading pit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, having so far been contained in a spent fuel rack <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a spent fuel pit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, are pulled out one after another by means of a pit crane <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and loaded in succession into the basket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. After a given number of spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are loaded into the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the support plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are fitted successively into the top opening of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the transportation cask <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is pulled up from the cask loading pit <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and transferred to the decontamination pit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by the overhead traveling crane. In the decontamination pit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a suitable quantity of cooling water is discharged from the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that the surface of the cooling water <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is situated slightly above the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is welded to the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and complete dehydration, vacuum drying, inert gas replacement, sealing operation, and air leakage inspection are carried out. Further, the secondary lid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is welded, and inert gas replacement in the space between the primary and secondary lids <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, sealing operation, and air leakage inspection are carried out. Thus, seal-welding operation for the lids of the canister is finished, whereupon the canister is completed containing the spent fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the top opening of the cask <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is closed by means of a lid <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, and a pre-transportation check is conducted, whereupon pre-shipment preparations are completed. Then, the transportation cask <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, thus containing the canister <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is transported from a power plant to a storage facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The following is a detailed description of a seal-welding method for the lids of the canister <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> After the support blocks <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are mounted in the top opening of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a suitable quantity of the cooling water <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is discharged, as mentioned before, the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is fitted into the top opening of the vessel body, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Since the O-ring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is provided on the outer periphery of the lower surface of the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> so as to be in intimate contact with the support plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as mentioned before, the gap between the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is sealed with respect to the interior of the vessel body by the O-ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, moreover, the upper end part of the outer peripheral portion of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> forms a welding portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed extending throughout the circumference under the welding portion, that is, on the lower end side of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as compared with the welding portion. Further, the outer peripheral portion of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is formed having charging holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that communicate with the groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and open in the upper surface of the lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, e.g., two in number, are spaced in the circumferential direction of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The outer peripheral portion of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> set in place is adjacently opposed to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> defines a substantially closed annular space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> under the welding portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> After the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is set in place, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, its topside peripheral edge portion is welded stepwise to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by a welding device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In order to intercept radiation from the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is kept filled with the cooling water <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> during this welding operation. Since welding the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> takes a lot of time, the cooling water <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is heated and gradually evaporated by means of heat from the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> during the welding operation. The resulting steam is urged to flow out toward the top opening of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through the gap between the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body and the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Since the gap between the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is closed by the O-ring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, however, the quantity of steam that flows into the gap can be reduced considerably. Thus, the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be welded without involving any weld defects that are attributable to steam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In performing the welding operation, according to the present embodiment, moreover, an exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (mentioned later) is set by utilizing the discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and a shield gas supply device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to one of the charging holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is welded by a welding device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in a manner such that the steam generated in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is discharged from the vessel body and that a shield gas is run through the space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is defined by the groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the support plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, by means of the shield gas supply device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of the exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with a charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and an exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be passed through the discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> forms a double-pipe structure such that it is substantially coaxially located in the charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a charging port <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which opens into the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> when the pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is passed through the discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and a suction port <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>b, which opens to the outside of the vessel body. The exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has an exhaust port <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which opens into the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and an extending portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>which extends to the outside of the vessel body. The charging port <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the exhaust port <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are trumpet-shaped and substantially coaxial with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A ring-shaped adapter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having a flange is fixed to the outer periphery of the charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be airtightly closed with the charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> passed through the discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and with the adapter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> fitted tight in the discharge hole of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through a load beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Further, the exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with a suction pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is connected to the extending portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> serves as suction means that evacuates the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and charges the open air into the vessel body through the charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Further, the exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with a butterfly valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> located near the suction port <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a flow regulating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which adjusts the opening of the valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby regulating the quantity of air charged into the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> During the welding operation, the suction pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is actuated to discharge air, which contains the steam generated in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, through the exhaust port <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Thereupon, the open air is fed into the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through the charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In doing this, the internal pressure of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is controlled by adjusting the opening of the butterfly valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by the flow regulating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby regulating the air charge. Thus, the steam generated in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be efficiently discharged from the vessel body and securely prevented from flowing into the welding portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, on the other hand, the shield gas supply device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a containing tank <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a gas supply pipe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a pump <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The tank <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contains an inert gas such as argon for use as the shield gas. The pipe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected to the charging holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The pump <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> supplies the shield gas in the containing tank <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through the gas supply pipe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> During the welding operation, the shield gas supply device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> supplies the shield gas to the space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> under the welding portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, thereby filling the space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the shield gas or causing the shield gas to flow. With use of the shield gas, therefore, the steam that is urged to flow into the welding portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be cut off, so that it can be more securely prevented from flowing into the welding portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> After the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is welded by the method described above, water in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is discharged. In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, for example, the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is pressurized inside through the discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by a pressure pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and the water in the vessel body is discharged to the outside by a drain pipe <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> that is inserted in the vessel body through the discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, vacuum drying of the interior of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, inert gas replacement, sealing operation, and air leakage inspection are carried out, and the discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is then sealed by means of the plug <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Thereafter, the secondary lid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is set in the top opening of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to be lapped on the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Then, the peripheral edge portion of the secondary lid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is welded to the inner peripheral surface of the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by the welding device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, inert gas replacement, sealing operation, and air leakage inspection are carried out for the space between the primary and secondary lids <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, whereupon the seal-welding operation for the lids of the canister <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> terminates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to the canister <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> constructed in this manner and the seal-welding method for its lids, the gap between the shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is closed by the O-ring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In welding the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, therefore, steam can be prevented from flowing into the welding portion through the gap. In consequence, the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be securely welded without involving any weld defects that are attributable to steam. Thus, the resulting canister provides improved integrity and high radiation shielding properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is welded, moreover, the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is evacuated by means of the exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and steam is discharged. By doing this, steam can be more securely prevented from getting into the welding portion, so that the primary lid can be welded with higher reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> According to the exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> constructed in this manner, the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be simultaneously exhausted and charged by using the one discharge hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the air containing steam in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is discharged through the exhaust port <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the suction pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and together with this, air is charged into the vessel body through the charging pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, whereby the internal pressure of the vessel body is regulated. Thus, the steam that is generated in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be efficiently discharged from the vessel body, so that a large quantity of steam can be prevented from getting into the welding portion. Even though radiation from the spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is intercepted by the cooling water <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> during the welding operation, therefore, satisfactory circumstances can be enjoyed without involving any voids in the welding portion, and improvement of the welding accuracy can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, moreover, steam can be more securely prevented from getting into the welding portion in a manner such that the shield gas is filled into or run through the space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the outer peripheral portion of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as the primary lid is welded. The resulting canister provides high integrity and satisfactory radiation shielding properties without involving any weld defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Although the discharge of steam by means of the exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the interception of steam by means of the shield gas are carried out simultaneously according to the embodiment described above, only one of these operations may be performed with the same effect. In this case, the resulting canister also provides high integrity without involving any weld defects that are attributable to steam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of a canister <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to a second embodiment of the invention. According to the second embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the top opening of a vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is closed by a primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and a secondary lid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> only, and a shielding plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is omitted. Since the second embodiment shares other configurations with the first embodiment, like reference numerals are used to designate like portions, and a detailed description of those portions is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In a seal-welding method for the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment, as in the case of the first embodiment, the topside peripheral edge portion of the primary lid is welded stepwise by the welding device with spent fuel assemblies <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> immersed in cooling water. In doing this, the exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is used to discharge steam in the vessel body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the outside, and the shield gas supply device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used to fill into or run the shield gas through a space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the outer peripheral portion of the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Also in the second embodiment, therefore, steam can be prevented from flowing into the welding portion as the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is welded, so that the primary lid <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be securely welded without involving any weld defects that are attributable to steam. Thus, the resulting canister enjoys improved radiation shielding properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Also in the second embodiment, moreover, only one of the operations for discharging steam by means of the exhaust system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and intercepting steam by means of the shield gas may be carried out with the same effect. In this case, steam can be prevented from reaching the welding portion, and therefore, generation of weld defects can be prevented. Thus, the resulting canister provides high shielding properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> For example, the seal member used in the first embodiment is not limited to the O-ring, and may be selected from various elements as required. It may, for example, be a metal wire, sealing tape, heat-resistant tube, or heat-resistant paste. </paragraph>
