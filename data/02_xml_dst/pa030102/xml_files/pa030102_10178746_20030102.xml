<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a separating apparatus and processing method for a member such as a bonded substrate stack, a semiconductor substrate manufacturing method, and a semiconductor device manufacturing method. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A substrate (SOI substrate) having an SOI (Silicon On Insulator) structure is known as a substrate having a single-crystal Si layer on an insulating layer. A device using this SOI substrate has many advantages that cannot be achieved by ordinary Si substrates. Examples of the advantages are as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (1) The integration degree can be increased because dielectric isolation is easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (2) The radiation resistance can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (3) The operating speed of the device can be increased because the stray capacitance is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (4) No well step is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (5) Latch-up can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (6) A fully depleted field effect transistor can be formed by thin film formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Since an SOI structure has the above various advantages, researches have been made on its formation method for several decades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As a method, an SOI structure is formed by bonding a single-crystal Si substrate to another thermally oxidized single-crystal Si substrate by annealing or an adhesive. In this method, an active layer for forming a device must be uniformly thin. More specifically, a single-crystal Si substrate having a thickness of several hundred micron must be thinned down to the micron order or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> To thin the substrate, polishing or selective etching can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A single-crystal Si substrate can hardly be uniformly thinned by polishing. Especially, in thinning to the submicron order, the variation range is several ten %. As the wafer size becomes large, this difficulty becomes more pronounced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present applicant has disclosed a new SOI technique in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-21338. In this technique, a first substrate obtained by forming a porous layer on a single-crystal Si substrate and a non-porous single-crystal layer on its surface is bonded to a second substrate via an insulating layer. After this, the bonded substrate stack is separated into two substrates at the porous layer, thereby transferring the non-porous single-crystal layer to the second substrate. This technique is advantageous because the film thickness uniformity of the SOI layer is good, the crystal defect density in the SOI layer can be decreased, the surface planarity of the SOI layer is good, no expensive manufacturing apparatus with special specifications is required, and SOI substrates having about several hundred-&angst; to 10-&mgr;m thick SOI films can be manufactured by a single manufacturing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To separate the bonded first and second substrates into two substrates without breaking the first and second substrates, the following methods are available: the two substrates are pulled in opposite directions while applying a force in a direction perpendicular to the bonding interface; a shearing force is applied parallel to the bonding interface (for example, the two substrates are moved in opposite directions in a plane parallel to the bonding interface, or the two substrates are rotated in opposite directions while applying a force in the circumferential direction); pressure is applied in a direction perpendicular to the bonding interface; a wave energy such as an ultrasonic wave is applied to the separation region; a peeling member (e.g., a sharp blade such as a knife) is inserted into the separation region parallel to the bonding interface from the side surface side of the bonded substrate stack; the expansion energy of a substance filling the pores of the porous layer functioning as the separation region is used; the porous layer functioning as the separation region is thermally oxidized from the side surface of the bonded substrate stack to expand the volume of the porous layer and separate the substrates; and the porous layer functioning as the separation region is selectively etched from the side surface of the bonded substrate stack to separate the substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As a method of separating a bonded substrate stack, the present applicant disclosed an epoch-making technique in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-45840 (Japanese Patent No. 2,877,800). In the separating method described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-45840, a bonded substrate stack having a porous layer or ion implantation layer serving as a separation layer is separated into two substrates by injecting a fluid into the side surface of the bonded substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in the separating method described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-45840, the bonded substrate stack is held by a pair of holders (substrate holding portions) having a smaller size than that of the bonded substrate stack. A fluid is injected into the side surface of the bonded substrate stack while rotating it, thereby separating the bonded substrate stack into two substrates at the porous layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In holding the bonded substrate stack by the pair of holders, which have a size smaller than that of the bonded substrate stack, distortion may occur at the outer portion due to its own weight or the like, or the bonded substrate stack may be held with some distortion which has occurred in the manufacturing process remaining without being corrected. Assume that distortion exists in the bonded substrate stack held by holders. In this case, when a fluid is to be injected throughout the perimeter of the bonded substrate stack while rotating it, the fluid maybe injected to a position deviated from an appropriate position (e.g., a bonding interface or separation layer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For the sake of easy understanding, an extreme case will be described. For example, if the bonded substrate stack is largely distorted, a fluid ejected from a nozzle, the position of which has been adjusted on the assumption that the bonded substrate stack is not distorted, is not injected into the separation layer or bonding interface of the bonded substrate stack. When this occurs, separation processing may not progress at all. This will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a view showing a state wherein a bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which is largely distorted is separated into two substrates at a separation layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the position of the actual separation layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> largely deviates from that of a separation layer without any distortion (the ideal position of the separation layer). In this case, the position of a nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is adjusted on the assumption that the separation layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is arranged at the ideal position. When separation is performed in this state, a fluid from the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is not injected into the separation layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing smooth separation. If large distortion exists at the perimeter of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, separation does not progress speedily. This may result in unsatisfactory separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The probability of the above-described unsatisfactory separation would increasingly become higher due to increase in size of a bonded substrate stack along with increase in size of a required SOI substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In addition, in holding a bonded substrate stack by holders, some foreign substance may enter between the bonded substrate stack and holders. In this case as well, a fluid from a nozzle may be injected into a position deviated from the separation layer or bonding interface of the bonded substrate stack. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A separating apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises an ejecting portion (nozzle) and substrate holding portions (holders) for holding a member which has a separation layer inside (e.g., a bonded substrate stack). This separating apparatus changes the position or angle of the ejecting portion or changes the position of the substrate holding portions, halfway through separation processing of the bonded substrate stack held by the substrate holding portions, thereby changing the positional relationship between the orbit of a fluid (jet) ejected from the ejecting portion and the bonded substrate stack, e.g., stepwise. This change can be done in accordance with a program set in advance before the start of the separation processing (i.e., before actual separation of the bonded member progresses). For example, in the first step, a fluid is so ejected as to direct the orbit of a jet toward the bonding interface of the bonded substrate stack. After rotating the substrate stack once or more, in the second step, the jet orbit is changed in the direction of thickness of the substrate stack, and the substrate stack is rotated once or more. Needless to say, the jet orbit may further be changed in the third step. A plurality of nozzles (two or more nozzles), having a first jet orbit and second jet orbit which have been defined in advance before the start of separation processing, and which have different positions in the direction of thickness of a member, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When three jet orbits are to be used, an orbit extending toward the bonding interface may be defined as a first jet orbit; one shifted by &plus;&Dgr;h in the direction of thickness of the substrate stack, a second jet orbit; and one shifted by &minus;&Dgr;h, a third jet orbit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> When two jet orbits are to be used, the first jet orbit, which is located at a position shifted from the bonding interface (or separation layer) by &plus;&Dgr;h in the direction of thickness of the substrate stack, and a second jet orbit, which is located at a position shifted by &minus;&Dgr;h can be used. A value (to be described later) may be used as &Dgr;h. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The program is so set as to reliably separate a bonded substrate stack at its separation layer on the assumption that any distortion of the bonded substrate stack, or any shortage of accuracy in holding the bonded substrate stack is within a predetermined range (for example, &plusmn;0.1 mm from a designed position). This assumption can appropriately be modified depending on the manufacturing process of the bonded substrate stack or the accuracy in holding the bonded substrate stack. This program is determined as a program which is to be commonly applied to all bonded substrate stacks for a unit (e.g., a lot or a group of single products) in consideration of the manufacturing process of bonded substrate stacks or the like for each unit. A bonded substrate stack to be separated preferably has a recessed portion in its outer side. The positional relationship is so changed as to cause a fluid to be injected into the recessed portion throughout the perimeter of the bonded substrate stack. This recessed portion can be formed by manufacturing a bonded substrate stack using a first substrate (seed wafer) and second substrate (handle wafer), each of which employs a wafer which has a beveling portion with a round sectional shape. If only by bonding, a recessed portion is not formed, or it is not formed satisfactorily enough to cause a fluid to enter the inside of the bonded substrate stack so as to apply separating force to the bonded substrate stack, a recessed portion may be formed in the side surface of the bonded substrate stack by etching or the like. Alternatively, a sharp blade or the like may be inserted into the side surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Note that a change width &Dgr;h of a jet orbit in the direction of thickness of a bonded member can be set within a range between 10 &mgr;m to 100 &mgr;m, and preferably 25 &mgr;m to 75 &mgr;m with respect to the position of its bonding interface (or separation layer) as a reference. In the following description, an example wherein the change width is set to be 50 &mgr;m, i.e., 0.05 mm is shown. Needless to say, the above change width can be applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The jet orbit in the horizontal direction of the bonded substrate stack may be directed toward the center of the bonded substrate stack, or may not be directed toward the center. To separate the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack more efficiently, the orbit is preferably directed to a direction deviated from the center of the bonded substrate stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a view showing the arrangement of a separating apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A separating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> horizontally holds a bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as a plate member to be separated and ejects a fluid (e.g., a liquid such as water, or a gas such as air) toward the outer side of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while rotating it, thereby separating the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into two substrates at a porous layer (separation layer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is held by a pair of substrate holding portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which have a common central axis. The bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be held by a chuck mechanism provided in the pair of substrate holding portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or clamped by the pair of substrate holding portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The upper substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is connected to a motor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> through a rotating shaft <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and coupling <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The rotational speed of the motor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is arbitrarily controlled by a controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The rotating shaft <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is axially supported by an upper table <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> through a bearing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The lower substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is connected to an air cylinder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through a rotating shaft <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and coupling <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Hence, the lower substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is vertically moved by the air cylinder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The air cylinder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is driven to set the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the separating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and detach the separated substrates from the separating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The air cylinder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can also be driven to apply a press force or tensile force (when the bonded substrate stack is chucked) to the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as needed in separation processing. The air cylinder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is controlled by the controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The rotating shaft <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is axially supported by a lower table <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> through a bearing <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A nozzle (ejecting portion) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for ejecting a fluid is arranged on the lower table <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is adjusted, e.g., in a direction (vertical direction) parallel to the axial direction of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and/or in a direction (horizontal direction) parallel to the planar direction of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected to the outlet of a servo-driven pump <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through a high-pressure hose <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, valve <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, and high-pressure pipe <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The servo-driven pump <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a pressure gauge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for detecting the pressure of the fluid at the outlet. On the basis of the output from the pressure gauge <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the variation in pressure of the fluid is suppressed within a predetermined value (e.g., 10% of the target pressure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> For example, when a bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be distorted, or the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be held at a position deviated from an ideal position due to some foreign substance between the substrate holding portions and bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a fluid may be injected into a position deviated from the recessed portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A separating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment solves such a problem in separation processing in the following way. This separating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> changes the vertical position (the position in a direction perpendicular to the separation layer of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> stepwise by the position adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> halfway through separation processing. This means changing the positional relationship between the orbit of a fluid (jet) to be ejected from the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> halfway through the separation processing. This change is so performed stepwise for, e.g., each rotation of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as to inject a fluid into the recessed portion of the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> throughout its perimeter. The jet orbit may be changed while ejection of the fluid is temporarily stopped. Alternatively, a change in jet orbit (change in nozzle position in the direction of thickness of the member) may be performed at a temporarily reduced pressure. Needless to say, the pressure of a fluid to be ejected in change may be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> An example of a separating method of performing separation processing by changing the position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> stepwise for each rotation of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a view showing first-stage separation processing; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, second-stage separation processing; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, third-stage separation processing. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a view showing the progress of separation of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> after the second-stage separation processing; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the progress of separation of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> after the third-stage separation processing. In this example, the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated throughout its perimeter in the first-stage processing to third-stage separation processing, and the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated into two substrates at the entire region of the separation layer in the subsequent separation processing. Note that the controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> controls separation processing in accordance with a program which is set in advance on the assumption that any distortion in a bonded substrate stack to be separated is within a predetermined range in the following processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> First, in the first-stage separation processing (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the vertical position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is positioned at a reference level (reference position) under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The reference level can be considered as a level of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at which the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can inject a fluid into the recessed portion (especially, the bonding interface or separation layer) of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> without any distortion when the substrate holding portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> appropriately hold the bonded substrate stack. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the reference level is described as &ldquo;&Dgr;h&equals;0&rdquo;. The first-stage separation processing separates the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with some distortion at, e.g., a portion indicated by S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the portion other than the portion S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is an unseparated portion, which has not been separated because a fluid has not appropriately been injected into the recessed portion in the unseparated portion due to some distortion in the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or unsatisfactory holding of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> caused by some foreign substance or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Next, in the second-stage separation processing (S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the vertical position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is positioned at a position (&Dgr;h&equals;&plus;0.05 mm) shifted from the reference level (&Dgr;h&equals;0) by 0.05 mm in the positive direction (in this case, the upward direction) under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Note that this displacement amount (&Dgr;h&plus;0.05 mm) can be determined in consideration of the manufacturing process of bonded substrate stacks for each unit (e.g., a lot or a group of single products). This example assures separation processing of at least a bonded substrate stack with a distortion of &plus;0.05 mm from a reference position (designed position). Since, in fact, a fluid ejected from the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has a corresponding diameter (e.g., 0.1 mm), even a bonded substrate stack with a distortion of more than the displacement amount of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can appropriately be separated as far as the excess amount over the displacement amount is small. The second-stage separation processing separates the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with some distortion at, e.g., a portion indicated by S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the portion other than the portions S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is an unseparated portion, which has not been separated because a fluid has not appropriately been injected into the recessed portion in the unseparated portion due to some distortion in the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or unsatisfactory holding of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> caused by some foreign substance or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Then, in the third-stage separation processing (S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), the vertical position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is positioned at a position (&Dgr;h&equals;&minus;0.05 mm) shifted from the reference level (&Dgr;h&equals;0) by 0.05 mm in the negative direction (in this case, the downward direction) under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The third-stage separation processing separates the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with some distortion at, e.g., a portion indicated by S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. More specifically, the first-stage processing to third-stage processing separate the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> throughout its perimeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the fourth-stage separation processing (S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), the vertical position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is typically fixedly positioned at a reference level (reference position) under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The fourth-stage separation processing may typically be performed without changing the position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In this state, the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is completely separated into two substrates at the entire region of the separation layer. In the fourth-stage separation processing as well, the position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be changed stepwise. Since the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated throughout its perimeter at the fourth stage, a fluid is easily injected into the inside of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the center portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is distorted less than the outer portion. In the fourth-stage separation processing, therefore, even if the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is positioned at the reference level, separation can progress without any problems. One or more bonded substrate stacks may be taken out of a lot or a group of products with single specifications of bonded substrate stacks, and any distortion around the taken bonded substrate stacks may be measured to determine the displacement amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the separating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which has been described, the position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is changed stepwise in accordance with a program set in advance while keeping the position in the axial direction (perpendicular direction) of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> fixed. Needless to say, the position of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (the substrate holding portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) may be changed stepwise in accordance with a program set in advance while keeping the position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> fixed in place of changing the position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the respective positions of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be changed, e.g., stepwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the elevation angle (or the elevation angle and position) of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be changed in accordance with a program set in advance by adding a function of changing the elevation angle of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the position adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a view showing an example of the position adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> comprising a mechanism for adjusting the elevation angle and position of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The position adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> includes a first adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> for adjusting the vertical position (the position in the planar direction) of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a second adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> for adjusting the elevation angle of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the separating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is held horizontally. However, the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be held vertically. When the bonded substrate is held horizontally, the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can easily be transferred to/from other apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The overall flow of a separating method using the separating apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> First, the air cylinder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is actuated to move the lower substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> downward, and the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is transferred to a predetermined position between the pair of substrate holding portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by a transfer robot or the like. The air cylinder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is actuated to move the lower substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> upward and cause the pair of substrate holding portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to hold the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. If the pair of substrate holding portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> have a chuck mechanism, they may be actuated to chuck the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In addition, a press force or tensile force may be applied to the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by the air cylinder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be held by applying a press force to the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by the air cylinder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> without chucking the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next, under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is driven while a fluid is ejected from the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, thereby rotating the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Also, at the same time, under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> as described above, the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated while changing stepwise the positional relationship between the orbit of a fluid (jet) ejected from the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. With this processing, the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated throughout its perimeter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, for example, even if the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a distortion within a predetermined range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated into two substrates completely to the center, typically after the outer portion is separated throughout its perimeter and then the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is rotated several times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> After the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated, the air cylinder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is actuated to move the lower substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> downward. The two separated substrates are received from the substrate holding portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by, e.g., a transfer robot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and bonded substrate stack (outer portion) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to be separated preferably has a &ggr;-shaped recessed portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in its section. Forming the recessed portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> enables a fluid from the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to be efficiently injected to the porous layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thus resulting in smooth separation at the porous layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As described previously, this recessed portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> forms when a bonded substrate stack is formed using a first substrate (seed wafer) and second substrate (handle wafer), each of which is a general wafer that has a beveling portion with a round sectional shape. </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, only the substrate holding portions and nozzles are shown. The other components are the same as those of the separating apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The separating apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> comprises a plurality of nozzles <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>C. The plurality of nozzles <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>C may have positions different from each other in a direction (vertical direction) perpendicular to the separation layer of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A is arranged at a position with a reference level (&Dgr;h&equals;0). The nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>B is arranged at a position (&Dgr;h&equals;&plus;0.05 mm) shifted from the reference level by a predetermined distance (in this case, 0.05 mm) in the positive direction, and the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>C is arranged at a position (&Dgr;h&equals;&minus;0.05 mm) shifted from the reference level by a predetermined distance (in this case, 0.05 mm) in the negative direction. The positions of the plurality of nozzles <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may be adjusted respectively by the same position adjusting mechanisms as the above-described position adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as needed (for example, in accordance with a program). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In this modification, under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, in the first-stage separation processing (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated while selectively ejecting a fluid from the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A, and in the second-stage separation processing (S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated while selectively ejecting the fluid from the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>B. In the third-stage separation processing (S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated while selectively ejecting the fluid from the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>C. With these separation processing, the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is separated throughout its perimeter. Note that a fluid may be ejected simultaneously from the above three nozzles in place of selectively ejecting the fluid from the plurality of nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the fourth-stage of separation processing, a fluid is typically ejected from the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A to completely separate the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at the entire area of the separation layer under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Note that in the present invention, a liquid such as water or an etchant, a gas such as air, nitrogen or argon, a fluid mixture of liquid and gas, or the like may be used as a fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Next, a method of manufacturing a substrate will be described as an application of the above separating method. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E are views for explaining a method of manufacturing a substrate having, e.g., an SOI structure according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> single-crystal Si substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be used to form a first substrate (seed wafer) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is prepared, and a porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> serving as a separation layer is formed on the major surface of the single-crystal Si substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be formed by, e.g., anodizing the single-crystal Si substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in an electrolyte solution (anodizing solution). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As the electrolyte solution, for example, a solution containing hydrogen fluoride, a solution containing hydrogen fluoride and ethanol, a solution containing hydrogen fluoride and isopropyl alcohol, or the like can be used. More specifically, as the electrolyte solution, for example, a solution mixture containing an HF aqueous solution (HF concentration&equals;49 wt %) and ethanol at a volume ratio of 2:1 can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have a multilayered structure including two or more layers with different porosities. The porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a multilayered structure preferably includes a first porous Si layer with a first porosity on the surface side, and, under the first porous Si layer, a second porous Si layer with a second porosity higher than the first porosity. With such a multilayered structure, a non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> free from defects can be formed on the first porous Si layer in the step of forming the non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> later, and a bonded substrate stack can be separated at a desired position in the separation step later. The first porosity is preferably 10% to 30% and, more preferably, 15% to 25%. The second porosity is preferably 35% to 70% and, more preferably, 40% to 60%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> When the above solution mixture (49 wt % hydrofluoric acid: ethanol&equals;2:1) is used as the electrolyte solution, preferably, for example, the first layer (surface side) is formed at a current density of 8 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for a process time of 5 to 11 min, and the second layer (inner surface side) is formed at a current density of 23 to 33 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for a process time of 80 sec to 2 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Next, at least one of the following steps (1) to (4) is preferably executed. The steps (1) and (2) are preferably executed in this order. More preferably, the steps (1), (2), and (3), or (1), (2), and (4) are executed in this order. Most preferably, the steps (1), (2), (3), and (4) are executed in this order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> (1) Step of Forming Protective Film on Porous Walls in Porous Si Layer (Pre-Oxidation Step) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In this step, a protective film such as an oxide film or nitride film is formed on the porous walls in the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing any increase in porous size by subsequent annealing. The protective film can be formed by performing annealing in an oxygen atmosphere (preferably at, e.g., 200&deg; C. to 700&deg; C., and more preferably at 300&deg; C. to 500&deg; C.). After that, the oxide film or the like formed on the surface of the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably removed. This can be done by, e.g., exposing the surface of the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a solution containing hydrofluoric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> (2) Hydrogen Baking Step (Pre-Baking Step) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In this step, the first substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on which the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed is annealed in a reduction atmosphere containing hydrogen at 800&deg; C. to 1,200&deg; C. With this annealing, pores on the surface of the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be sealed to some extent. If a native oxide film is present on the surface of the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it can be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> (3) Trace Material Supply Step (Pre-Injection Step) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> When the non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is to be grown on the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it is preferably grown at a low speed by supplying a trace amount of raw material substance of the non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the initial stage of growth. With this growing method, atomic migration on the surface of the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is promoted, and pores on the surface of the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be sealed. More specifically, the supply of the raw material is controlled such that the growth rate becomes 20 nm/min or less, preferably 10 nm/min or less, and more preferably, 2 nm/min or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> (4) High-Temperature Baking Step (Intermediate Baking Step) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> When annealing is executed in a reduction atmosphere containing hydrogen at a temperature higher than that in the above hydrogen baking step and/or trace material supply step, further sealing and flattening of the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> At the first stage of the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the first non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed on the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As the first non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, an Si layer such as a single-crystal Si layer, poly-Si layer, or amorphous Si layer, Ge layer, SiGe layer, SiC layer, C layer, GaAs layer, GaN layer, AlGaAs layer, InGaAs layer, InP layer, or InAs layer can be used. Needless to say, layers made of the above-described materials may be used in combination as the first non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as needed. For example, a non-porous single-crystal Si layer may be formed on the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a SiGe layer may be formed on the non-porous single-crystal Si layer, and one more non-porous single-crystal Si layer may be formed on the SiGe layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> At the second stage of the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer (insulating layer) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as the second non-porous layer is formed on the first non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. With this process, the first substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is obtained. The SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be formed, e.g., in an O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere at 1,100&deg; C. for 10 to 33 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C, a</cross-reference> second substrate (handle wafer) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is prepared and brought into tight contact with the first substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at room temperature while making the insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> face the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be formed either on the single-crystal Si layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> side, or on the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or on both the single-crystal Si layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as long as the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> is obtained when the first and second substrates are brought into tight contact with each other. However, when the insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed on the first non-porous layer (e.g., a single-crystal Si layer) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> side serving as an active layer, as described above, the bonding interface between the first substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be separated from the active layer, and a semiconductor substrate such as an SOI substrate with a higher quality can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> After the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are completely brought into tight contact, processing of strengthening bonding between the substrates is preferably executed. As an example of this processing, processing of, e.g., 1) executing annealing in an N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere at 1,100&deg; C. for 10 min and 2) executing annealing (oxidation) in an O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere at 1,100&deg; C. for 50 to 100 min is preferably performed. In addition to this processing, or in place of this processing, anodic bonding and/or compression may be executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> As the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an Si substrate, a substrate obtained by forming an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer on an Si substrate, a transparent substrate formed from quartz or the like, or a sapphire substrate can be used. However, a substrate of another type which has a sufficiently flat surface to be bonded may be used as the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>D, the bonded substrate stack <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is separated at the fragile porous layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a low mechanical strength using the above-described separating method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E, a</cross-reference> porous layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&Prime; on the first non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the separated second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is selectively removed by etching or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> A porous layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; on the single-crystal Si substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of a separated first substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; is selectively removed by etching or the like. The single-crystal Si substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> obtained in this way can be reused as a substrate for forming the first substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or as the second substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> As a bonded substrate stack, a substrate prepared by the following method may be employed. First, a semiconductor substrate represented by a single-crystal Si substrate such as a mirror wafer or epitaxial wafer is prepared. An insulating film such as a thermal silicon oxide film is formed on the surface of the substrate, as needed. Next, ions such as positive or negative hydrogen ions or rare gas ions are implanted into the substrate by ion implantation using a line beam or plasma immersion, thereby forming a relatively heavily doped ion implantation layer serving as a separation layer at a predetermined depth from the surface. The first substrate is obtained in the above manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Next, the second substrate is prepared according to the same procedure as described above and bonded to the first substrate in accordance with the above-described bonding method. With this process, a bonded substrate stack having a layer to be transferred (transfer layer) inside can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The ion implantation layer is distorted or contains defects or pores formed from microcavities due to the implanted ions. Such an ion implantation layer has a relatively low mechanical strength and therefore functions as a separation layer. Note that the bonded substrate stack may be separated using a fluid as described above after annealing to the extent that the bonded substrate stack is not completely separated. In this case, annealing can enhance the bonding force in the bonding interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Even if the separation layer is not exposed to the outer portion of the bonded substrate stack, a tensile force is applied to the separation layer by ejecting the fluid into the bonded substrate stack, and thus the bonded substrate stack is separated at the separation layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> A separating apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is useful for separating a bonded substrate stack (an example of a member to be separated) which has a separation layer such as a porous layer formed by anodization or an ion implantation layer formed by ion implantation into two substrates at the separation layer. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>D, it is shown that separation occurs inside the separation layer. However, the bonded substrate stack may be separated at the interface between the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and/or the interface between the single-crystal Si substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Needless to say, it is also preferable to separate the bonded substrate stack almost at the interface between the porous Si layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by controlling by controlling, e.g., the layer structure of the separation layer. Preferably, the surface of the non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which has been transferred onto the second substrate is planarized by polishing and/or annealing (hydrogen annealing) in an atmosphere containing hydrogen, as needed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> First, an SOI substrate which has a semiconductor layer as a non-porous layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and an insulating layer as a non-porous layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is manufactured using the above substrate manufacturing method. An active region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; where a transistor is to be formed and an element isolation region <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are formed by a method of patterning the non-porous semiconductor layer (SOI layer) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the buried insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into an island shape or an oxidation method called LOCOS (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Next, a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the SOI layer (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>). Examples of the material of the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, hafnium oxide, titanium oxide, scandium oxide, yttrium oxide, gadolinium oxide, lanthanum oxide, zirconium oxide, and a glass mixture thereof. The gate oxide film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be formed by, e.g., oxidizing the surface of the SOI layer or depositing an appropriate substance on the surface of the SOI layer by CVD or PVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> A gate electrode <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed on the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>). The gate electrode <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be formed from, e.g., polysilicon doped with a p- or n-type impurity, a metal such as tungsten, molybdenum, titanium, tantalum, aluminum, or copper or an alloy containing at least one of them, a metal silicide such as molybdenum silicide, tungsten silicide, or cobalt silicide, or a metal nitride such as titanium nitride, tungsten nitride, or tantalum nitride. The gate insulating film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be formed by stacking a plurality of layers formed from different materials, like a polycide gate. The gate electrode <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be formed either by, e.g., a method called Salicide (self-align silicide) or by a method called a damascene gate process, or by any other method. With the above process, a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Next, an n-type impurity such as phosphor, arsenic, or antimony or a p-type impurity such as boron is doped into the active region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;, thereby forming relatively lightly-doped source and drain regions <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference>). The impurity can be doped by, e.g., ion implantation and annealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> An insulating film is formed to cover the gate electrode <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and then etched back, thereby forming a side wall <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> on the side surface of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> An impurity having the same conductivity type as described above is doped into the active region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; again, thereby forming relatively heavily-doped source and drain regions <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. With the above process, a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> A metal silicide layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper surface of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and on the upper surfaces of the source and drain regions <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Examples of the material of the metal silicide layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are nickel silicide, titanium silicide, cobalt silicide, molybdenum silicide, and tungsten silicide. Such a silicide can be formed by depositing a metal on the upper surface of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and on the upper surfaces of the source and drain regions <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, performing annealing to cause the metal to react with underlying silicon, and removing an unreacted portion of the metal using an etchant such as sulfuric acid. The surface of the silicide layer may be nitrided as needed. With the above process, a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> An insulating film <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper surface of the gate electrode and on the upper surfaces of the source and drain regions, which are converted into a silicide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</cross-reference>). As the material of the insulating film <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, silicon oxide containing phosphor and/or boron can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Contact holes are formed in the insulating film <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> by CMP, as needed. When photolithography using a KrF excimer laser, ArF excimer laser, F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>excimer laser, electron beam, or X-rays is used, a rectangular contact hole with aside smaller than 0.25 &mgr;m or a circular contact hole having a diameter smaller than 0.25 &mgr;m can be formed. </paragraph>
