<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to depilatories and in particular, to a depilatory utilizing water soluble adhesive blend which eliminates the need for removal of waxy residue by a solvent or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Depilatories are well known in the art and have been used for many years, particularly by women, to remove body hair. Initially, a depilatory consisted of waxes blended with tackifying resins, simply termed &ldquo;wax&rdquo;, which was melted and applied to the skin and allowed to set. It was stripped from the skin and in doing so, removed unwanted hair. This type of treatment can be obtained in a beauty salon or performed at home. &ldquo;Waxes&rdquo; utilized in a depilatory treatment were petroleum based waxes and resins typically rosin based. As such, after having stripped or removed, there remained on the skin a waxy, resinous residue. Since the composition inherently contained water insoluble ingredients, this residue also was not water soluble, and had to be removed from the skin with a suitable solvent such as baby oil or mineral oil which then necessitated rinsing the skin with water and soap or detergent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Depilatories in sheet like form or strips have also been developed wherein the petroleum based wax/resin mixture is precoated on a substrate. The individual would purchase a package of such depilatories, the sheets containing the &ldquo;wax&rdquo; would then be applied to the skin and allowed to set and then stripped away and removed. This procedure suffers from the same problem as described previously where the &ldquo;wax&rdquo; is applied from a container directly to the skin. A waxy, resinous residue remains once the wax has been peeled away and this residue must be removed with an appropriate solvent such as baby oil or mineral oil which also necessitates rinsing with water and soap or detergent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Sugar based &ldquo;waxes&rdquo; have been developed which can be applied to the skin from a container for the removal of body hair. These &ldquo;waxes&rdquo; are water soluble and therefore do not require a solvent for the removal of any residue, the residue being removable with water. However, the sugar based waxes are not suitable on sheets or strips for application in that they lack a sufficient viscosity, and lack sufficient thermal stability. Other water soluble waxes have been developed, but they too have not been compatible or suitable to coating onto a substrate for use in a sheet or strip type depilatory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Applicant has developed a sheet or strip type depilatory utilizing a water soluble adhesive blend and the process for making same that allows for suitable shelf life for the product. The product can be maintained and not deteriorate over a wide temperature range and still performs the hair removal function. The ability to provide the user or individual with a sheet or strip depilatory with a water soluble adhesive blend allows the user to apply the depilatory for the removal of hair and subsequently remove the depilatory and wash away or shower away the residue which remains. The individual no longer is required to remove a residue with a suitable solvent such as baby oil or mineral oil and to then wash away or take a shower to remove the solvent. It also provides the individual with the convenience of a water soluble sheet or strip depilatory heretofore unavailable with sugar based &ldquo;waxes&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Water solubility or dispersability of the hot melt adhesive is accomplished by the incorporation of appropriate hydrophilic raw materials which individually or in combination with other selected components, including surfactants, emulsifiers, waxes, resins, plasticizers and polymers provide the desired functionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Examples of water soluble or water dispersable polymers comprise polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl acetate (PVP/VA), polyethyl-oxazoline (PEOX), branched sulfo-polyesters (Eastman AQ Branched Polyesters), manufactured by Eastman, and polyvinyl methyl ether. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Suitable waxes can include those such as ethoxylated montan wax (Hoechst wax KST), polyethylene glycol waxes, and ethoxylated alcohols (Unithox) manufactured by Baker Hughes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Desirable plasticizers incorporated to improve water solubility and dispersibility and lower viscosity are liquid polyethylene glycols, polyethylene aryl ethers and monomeric plasticizers such as diethylene glycol dibenzoate (Benzoflex 2-45), dipropylene glycol dibenzoate (Benzoate 9-88), both manufactured by Velsicol Chemical Corp. Solid plasticizers such as dicyclohexyl phthalate and 1-4 cyclohexane dimethanol may be added to enhance, tack and raise the melting point of the adhesive to prevent cold flow under elevated temperature conditions. Surfactants and emulsifying agents are numerous and well known in the industry. Of those that we have discovered to be particularly useful are nonylphenol ethoxylated polyethylene glycol (Igepal 880) manufactured by Rhone-Poulenc and dioctyl ester of sodium sulfo-succinic acid (Aerosol OT-100) by Cytec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Resins are employed to enhance tack and adhesion. Suitable resins that can be blended into the adhesive are rosins, disproportionated rosin soaps, hydroabietyl alcohol, polymerized rosin, rosin derivative and rosin derived dimeric acids. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view (not to scale) of a depilatory of a sheet or strip depilatory <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> identifying the multiple layers associated therewith utilizing an adhesive blend for the removal of body hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Sheet or strip depilatories <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> come in a variety of sizes depending upon the area of the body to which it is to be applied. For the leg, the sheet or strip depilatory is normally sold in 4 inch by 8 inch strips. Sheet or strip depilatories 10 for the bikini region may be in the range of 3 inches by <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> inches and those depilatories <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> utilized for facial hair, in particular the upper lip, may be sold in narrow strips of &frac12; inch by 2 inches. Regardless of the size of the depilatory <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it can be formed in accordance with the teachings of applicant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the cross section illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, adhesive blend <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is melted and coated onto a first substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is then overlaid with a second substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This process is accomplished by providing for a continuous roll of first substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which passes through a coating station in which the adhesive blend <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is coated onto first side <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of first substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and thereafter, a continuous roll of second substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is overlaid the adhesive blend <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the continuous roll of adhesive blend <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, first substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be cut to the desired lengths. The width of first substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the width of the coating station applying adhesive blend <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may vary depending upon the width of the depilatory <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In forming depilatory <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the application of the adhesive blend <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to first substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provides for an uncoated longitudinal edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an uncoated longitudinal edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on first substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Second substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is overlaid adhesive blend <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that it also has uncoated longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Uncoated edges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> allow the user to be able to grasp the corresponding edge of first substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the end product in order to separate the depilatory <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for application of the adhesive blend <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In applying the depilatory <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the user grasps an uncoated edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of first substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the similar uncoated edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and separates depilatory <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the user is presented with two depilatories <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for application in that adhesive blend <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will separate and maintain a coating of the first substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will separate with a coating of adhesive blend <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a result of the weak cohesive integrity of the adhesive so that it &ldquo;splits&rdquo; evenly on both substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Substrates <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be formed of a suitable polymer such as polypropelene, or a suitable cellulosic material. </paragraph>
