<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A handheld device for exercising, rehabilitating and/or strengthening the muscles, tendons and ligament in the hands, wrists and/or forearm, as well as enabling the simultaneous improvement in the full range of motion in these regions. The device includes an elongated adjustable locking member having a lower cushioned hand pad portion and an upper hand pad base, adjustably connected to an elongated finger grip bar. The finger grip bar has a finger grip receiving edge and a post attached to this edge for slidably receiving weights. The device enables the wrists, hands and forearms to work together, enabling the user to exercise an injured or surgically repaired wrist, hand or forearm with the assistance of the uninjured wrist, hand or forearm, thereby reducing the overall duration of time needed for rehabilitation and recovery. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to an exercise device, and in particular, to a handheld hand, wrist and forearm exercising, strengthening and rehabilitation device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Injuries to the hand, wrist and/or forearms (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome, surgically repaired wrists and the like) typically require prolonged periods of physical therapy and rehabilitation in an attempt to fully recover and reclaim full strength and improved range of motion to the injured muscles, tendons and ligaments in the affected areas. There is currently a great need for a handheld hand, wrist and forearm rehabilitative device that facilitates a user&apos;s ability to recover full strength and full range of motion to the injured region. There is also a great need for handheld exercising device that facilitates the strengthening and the full range of motion in the hands, wrists and forearms for users who exercise with the device, enabling users to deliver more strength and increased range of motion in athletic activities that require such capabilities, including, but not limited to golf and tennis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Numerous hand, wrist and forearm exercising and rehabilitating devices are provided in the prior art. A few examples of such devices include U.S. Pat. No. 5,060,933 issued to Cedro; U.S. Pat. No. 5,957,813 issued to Macdonald; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,312,309 issued to Fox. Despite the great variety of exercising and rehabilitative devices available there remains a need for a handheld device capable of providing users with a means of strengthening the muscles, ligaments and tendons of an injured wrist, hand or forearm with the support of the healthy wrist, hand or forearm, while simultaneously improving the full range of motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Additionally, there remains a need for a handheld device that will shorten the duration of rehabilitation time typically required for rehabilitating an injured hand, wrist and/or forearm, and enable the user to substantially regain full strength and range of motion to the injured region. There is also a need for an exercise device the will enable a user to strengthen and build muscles, as well increase the full range of motion for the user&apos;s hands, wrists and/or forearms by engaging in exercising protocols that use the handheld device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> None of the prior art devices which applicants are aware of describes a handheld hand, wrist and/or forearm exercising, strengthening and rehabing device as disclosed and claimed herein. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide a handheld device for exercising, rehabilitating and/or strengthening the muscles, tendons and ligaments in the hands, wrists and/or forearm, while simultaneously enabling the user to substantially attain the full range of motion in the affected regions. In a preferred embodiment, the device includes an elongated adjustable locking member having a lower cushioned hand pad portion and an upper hand pad base, adjustably connected to an elongated finger grip bar. The finger grip bar has a finger grip receiving edge and a post attached to this edge for slidably receiving weights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to provide a handheld device that enables a user&apos;s wrists, hands and forearms to work together, so that the injured or surgically repaired wrist, hand or forearm can be exercised with the assistance of the uninjured wrist, hand or forearm, thereby strengthening and reading the injured region while simultaneously facilitating the full range of motion of the injured region, and reducing the overall duration of time needed for rehabilitation and recovery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An additional object of the present invention is to provide a handheld device having a hand lock down pad for stabilizing a user&apos;s hands while using the device, thereby enhancing the user&apos;s ability to use the device throughout a full range of motion exercises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of this invention to provide improved elements and arrangements thereof for the purposes described which are inexpensive, dependable and fully effective in accomplishing its intended purposes, and are capable of overcoming the above identified problems associated with prior art exercising devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings. </paragraph>
