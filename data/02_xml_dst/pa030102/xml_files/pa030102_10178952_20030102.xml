<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a dynamic bearing device and a motor having the same. This bearing device can be appropriately applied in a spindle motor of an information-processing equipment such as a magnetic disk device (e.g., HDD or FDD), an optical disk device (e.g., CD-ROM or DVD-ROM), an optical magnetic device (e.g., MD or MO), a polygon scanner motor of a laser beam printer (LBP), or a small-sized motor of an electric equipment (e.g., an axial flow fan). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, each of the motors described above has been in need of improvements on speeding up and noise-reduction of its rotary motion, cost-reduction in its production, and so on in addition to providing a rotary motion thereof with a high degree of precision. One of the structural factors that define these required performances is a bearing that supports a spindle of the motor. In recent years, for such a kind of the bearing, the usage of a dynamic bearing having excellent features for the above required performances has been considered or actually used in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For instance, a dynamic bearing device to be incorporated in a spindle motor of a disk device such as a hard disk drive (HDD) includes a radial bearing part that makes a non-contact support of an shaft member in a rotatable manner in the radial direction and a thrust bearing part that makes a non-contact support of an shaft member in the thrust direction. The dynamic bearing device utilizes a dynamic bearing as each of these bearing parts. The dynamic bearing has grooves for generating dynamic pressure in the bearing surface. Hereinafter, such grooves will be referred to as dynamic pressure generating grooves. The dynamic pressure generating grooves of the radial bearing part are formed in the inner peripheral surface of a housing or a bearing member, or the outer peripheral surface of a shaft member. When an shaft member having a flange part is used, the dynamic pressure generating grooves of the thrust bearing part are formed in both surfaces of the flange part or the surfaces facing to the respective surfaces (e.g., the end surface of the bearing member and the bottom surface of the housing). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As the above dynamic bearing device, the present applicant has already proposed the constitution of a dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No. <highlight><bold>2001-114317. </bold></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; mainly includes a bottomed cylindrical housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; with an opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; formed in its top end, an shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; and a bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; which are housed in the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime;, and a sealing member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, arranged on the opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> More concretely, the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; includes a cylindrical side portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; and a bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime;. Furthermore, the bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; has an inner bottom surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. In the area of the bottom surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; which serves as a thrust bearing surface, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, herringbone-shaped dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; is constructed of a porous material made of sintered metal. Herringbone-shaped dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; as shown by the dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> are formed in the upper and lower areas which serve as radial bearing surfaces, respectively. These upper and lower areas are separated in the axial direction such that an area <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; having no dynamic pressure generating groove is arranged between the upper and lower areas. Furthermore, in an area, which serves as a thrust bearing surface, of the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime;, herringbone-shaped dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; includes an axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; and a flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;. The flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>b&prime; is integrally or separately formed on the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a&prime;. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; of the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; is inserted in the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime;. The flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; is received in a space between the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; and the inner bottom surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime;. Predetermined Radial bearing gaps are formed between the upper and lower areas of the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; which serves as radial bearing surfaces and the outer peripheral surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; of the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;, respectively. Predetermined thrust bearing gaps are formed between the area of the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; which serves as the thrust bearing surface and the upper surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; of the flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;, and between the area of the inner bottom surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; which serves as the thrust bearing surface Sand the lower surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; of the flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The inner space of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; being sealed with a sealing member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, including pores of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime;, is filled with a lubricating oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; rotates, a dynamic pressure action of the lubricating oil is generated in the radial bearing gaps, so that the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; of the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; is rotatably supported in the radial direction in a non-contact manner by the oil film of the lubricating oil formed in the radial bearing gaps. Thus, the radial bearing parts R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; which rotatably support the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; in the radial direction in a non-contact manner are constituted. Simultaneously, a dynamic pressure action is generated in the thrust bearing gaps, so that the flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; of the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; is rotatably supported in the thrust directions in a non-contact manner by the oil film of the lubricating oil formed in the thrust bearing gaps. Thus, the thrust bearing parts S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; which rotatably support the flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; in the thrust directions in a non-contact manner are constituted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; constituted as above, the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; of the radial bearing parts R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; have their respective herringbone shapes which are symmetric with respect to the axial direction. Therefore, in the radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, the lubricating oil drawn from the both sides in the axial direction by the dynamic pressure generation grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; keeps its pressure balance at a position in proximity to the axial groove center of the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Likewise, in the radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, the lubricating oil drawn from the both sides in the axial direction by the dynamic pressure generating groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; keeps its pressure balance at a position in proximity to the axial groove center of the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;. At this time, since the radial bearing surface of each of the radial bearing parts R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; has a plurality of surface openings, which are formed by the pores of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; opening to the surface, in the radial bearing gap, where the pressure of the lubricating oil increases, the lubricating oil is returned from the radial bearing gap into the inside of the bearing. In addition, since there is a drawing action of each of the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, in the peripheral area of the radial bearing gap, the lubricating oil is supplied from the inside of the bearing into the radial bearing gap. The above pressure balance can be kept while being accompanied with such a circulation of the lubricating oil. However, there is a case that the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed with an asymmetric shape with respect to the axial direction as a result of manufacturing errors. In this case, the axial dimension of the lower groove region is larger than that of the upper groove region in the figure. Also, there is a case that the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed with an asymmetric shape with respect to the axial direction as a result of manufacturing errors. In this case, the axial dimension of the upper groove region is larger than that of the lower groove region in the figure. In these cases, between the upper and lower regions, there is a difference in the forces of drawing the lubricating oil into their grooves. As a result, the above pressure balance comes down. Therefore, the lubricating oil in the gap of an area between the radial bearing parts R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; (here, this gap is referred to as an X portion as shown by dotted circle in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and is larger than the radial bearing gap) is drawn into the radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and/or the radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, causing a negative pressure in the X portion. In addition, there is a case that the radial bearing gap of the radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is taper-shaped increasing upwardly as a result of manufacturing errors. Alternatively, there is another case that the radial bearing gap of the radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; is taper-shaped increasing downwardly as a result of manufacturing errors. In these cases, a flow of the lubricating oil in the radial bearing gap to the increased gap side is generated as the pressure of the increased gap side becomes decreased. As a result, the above pressure balance comes down. Therefore, there is a case that the lubricating oil in the X portion is drawn into the radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and/or the radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, causing a negative pressure in the X portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the above constitution of the dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; of the thrust bearing parts S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; have their respective herringbone shapes which are symmetric with respect to the radial direction. In the thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, the lubricating oil in the thrust bearing gap and in the surroundings thereof is drawn toward its radial groove center by means of the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. Likewise, in the thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, the lubricating oil in the thrust bearing gap and in the surroundings thereof is drawn toward its radial groove center by means of the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;. Therefore, there is a case that a negative pressure may be caused in each of gaps as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, that is, a gap around the boundary between the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; and the flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; (here, this gap is referred to as a Y portion as shown by dotted circle in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), a gap at an inner diameter side region than the thrust bearing part S&prime; (here, this gap is referred to as a U portion as shown by dotted circle in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and is larger than the gap of the thrust bearing gap), and a gap between the outer peripheral surface of the flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; and the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; (here, this gap is referred to as a Z portion as shown by dotted circle in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and is larger than the radial bearing gap). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> If the negative pressure generated in the inside of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; is large, then a cavitation is generated and the air solved in the lubricating oil can be emerged as air bubbles. If such air bubbles are involved in the bearing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. part, the accuracy of a rotation can be degenerated, so that RRO (Repeatable Run Out) and NRRO (Non Repeatable Run Out) can be deteriorated. Furthermore, if the temperature increases while accompanying with the air bubble, as the expansion of the air bubble, the lubricating oil in the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; is pushed out of the sealed space between the inner peripheral surface of the sealing member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; and the outer peripheral portion of the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;. As a result, there is a possibility of causing the leak of the lubricating oil to the outside. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to prevent the generation of a negative pressure in the housing and a cavitation due to the negative pressure, thereby to increase in a rotational accuracy and a sealing performance against a lubricating oil in a dynamic bearing device and a motor having the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> To attain the above object, there is provided a dynamic bearing device comprising a housing having an end with an opening and another end with a bottom part, an shaft member having an axial part and a flange part to be housed in the housing, a cylindrical bearing member to be housed in the housing, constituted by a porous body made of a sintered metal, at least one radial bearing part provided between an inner peripheral surface of the bearing member and an outer peripheral surface of the axial part, which supports the axial part in the radial direction in a non-contact manner by means of a dynamic pressure action of a lubricating oil to be caused in a radial bearing gap, thrust bearing parts provided between both surfaces of the flange part and an end surface of the bearing member and the bottom part of the housing, which support the flange part in the thrust directions in a non-contact manner by means of a dynamic pressure action of a lubricating oil to be caused in thrust bearing gaps, and a sealing member arranged in the opening of the housing, wherein an inner space of the housing including pores of the bearing member is filled with a lubricating oil, and wherein the bearing member comprises an area at the outer diameter side of an end surface area of the bearing member which constitutes the thrust bearing gap, the area having a percentage of surface openings of the pores larger than that of the end surface area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the above constitution of the dynamic bearing device, the radial bearing part may have dynamic pressure generating grooves which are shaped so that the lubricating oil in the radial bearing gap and its surroundings is drawn to the bottom part side of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the above constitution of the dynamic bearing device, the thrust bearing part may have dynamic pressure generating grooves which are in the shape of one selected from a spiral shape by which the lubricating oil in the thrust bearing gap and its surroundings is drawn in the inner diameter direction and a herringbone shape by which the lubricating oil in the thrust bearing gap and its surroundings is drawn toward a radial center portion of the thrust bearing part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the above constitution of the dynamic bearing device, the area having the larger percentage of surface openings may be provided on an inclined surface which is formed in a direction that the thrust bearing gap increases at the outer diameter side of the end surface area of the bearing member, for example, a chamfered surface. Alternatively, the area having the larger percentage of surface openings may be provided by a recessed portion which is formed in the outer peripheral portion of the bearing member and continuous to the end surface area of the bearing member. Such a recessed portion may be also continuous to the end surface area of the bearing member at he opening side of the housing, however, it is preferable that the recessed portion is not continuous to the end surface area at the opening side. When the recessed portion is also continuous to the end surface area at the opening side, there is a possibility that the effects intended in the present invention cannot be obtained in a sufficient manner because the lubricating oil supplied from the surface openings of the recessed portion may flow toward the end surface at the opening side. The recessed portion may be provided as an axial groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To attain the above object, there is provided a motor comprising a bracket for holding a stator, a rotor making a relative rotation with the bracket, a rotor magnet generating a rotating magnetic field in corporation with the stator, and a dynamic bearing device supporting the rotation of the rotor, wherein the dynamic bearing device is constituted as described above. Such a motor may be appropriately applied in a spindle motor of an information-processing equipment such as a magnetic disk device (e.g., HDD or FDD), an optical disc device (e.g., CD-ROM or DVD-ROM), an optical magnetic device (e.g., MD or MO), a polygon scanner motor of a laser beam printer (LBP), or a small-sized motor of an electric equipment (e.g., an axial flow fan). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it becomes possible to prevent the generation of the negative pressure in the housing and the cavitation due to the negative pressure. Thereby, it becomes possible to improve the rotational accuracy and the sealing performance against the lubricating oil in a dynamic bearing device and a motor having the same.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the exemplified constitution of a spindle motor as one of preferred embodiments of the present invention. In this embodiment, the spindle motor is one to be used in a information-processing equipment. In addition, a dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as one of preferred embodiments of the present invention is installed. In other words, the spindle motor is one to be used in a disk driving device such as a hard disk drive (HDD). The spindle motor comprises a dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> rotatably supporting a shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a non-contact manner, a rotor (disk hub) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> attached to the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a rotor magnet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> facing to each other through a radial gap therebetween. The stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is mounted on the outer periphery of a bracket <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, while the rotor magnet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is attached on the inner periphery of the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached on the inner periphery of the bracket <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A single disk D (or a plurality of disks D) such as a magnetic disk is held on the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is energized, the rotor magnet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> generates a rotating magnetic field together with the stator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, so that the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are rotated together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the constitution of the dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mainly includes the bottomed cylindrical housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having an end with an opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an another end with a bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>a cylindrical bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> fixed on the inner periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a sealing member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> fixed in the opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. As will be described later, a first radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a second radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are arranged between the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the outer peripheral surface of the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that the first and second radial bearing parts R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are apart from each other in the axial direction. In addition, a first thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided between the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the upper surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Also, a second thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided between the inner bottom surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the lower surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Furthermore, for a brief explanation, the direction toward the opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is defined as an upward direction. On the other hand, the direction toward the bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is defined as a downward direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be made of a soft metallic material such as brass. Such a housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical side portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>The inner bottom surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has an area which serves as a thrust bearing surface, that is a surface constitutes a thrust bearing gap of the second thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In such an area, dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, for example, these grooves <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be in the shape of a spiral. In this embodiment, furthermore, the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is constructed of independent structural components, the side portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>A cap member to be the bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is fixed to an opening at another end of the side portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by means of caulking, bonding or the like. Alternatively, the side part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may be integrally formed with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be made of a metal material such as stainless steel (SUS420J2 based on JIS G4304-1999). The shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises an axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be integrally or independently formed at the lower end of the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>In the outer peripheral surface of the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an annular groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a tapered surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed. The tapered surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a taper angle &thgr; by which the radius of the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> gradually decreases in the upward direction. In addition, a cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a tapered surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are continuously extended from the tapered surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the upward direction and their lengths in the axial direction are relatively short. Furthermore, the tapered surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a taper angle reverse to that of the taper surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is provided as a porous body made of a sintered metal, especially a porous body made of a sintered metal mainly containing cupper. The bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has pores (pores of the metallographic structure of a sintered metal) and surface openings formed by the pores opening to the surface. In addition, two areas (i.e., upper and lower areas) are formed on the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the state of being separated with each other in the axial direction, which serve as radial bearing surfaces (i.e., surfaces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, constituting the radial bearing gaps of the first and second radial parts R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the area which serves as the radial bearing surface of the first radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has herringbone-shaped dynamic pressure generating grooves. For examples, such an area comprises a first area m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on which dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inclined in one axial direction are arranged in the circumferential, a second area m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on which dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inclined in the other axial direction are arranged in the circumferential direction, and an annular portion n between the first area m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second area m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. An axial length of the first area m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is larger than that of the second area m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first area m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the second area m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are asymmetric in the axial direction with respect to the center of the annular portion n (i.e., the axial groove center thereof). In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the first area m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is axially long is located at the upper side (the side of the opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), the second area m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is axially short is located at the lower side (the side of the bottom <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) in the figure. Likewise, the area serving as the radial bearing surface of the second bearing part R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has herringbone-shaped dynamic pressure generating grooves. Such an area comprises a first area m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; on which dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> inclined in one axial direction are arranged in the circumferential, a second area m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; on which dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> inclined in the other axial direction are arranged in the circumferential direction, and an annular portion n&prime; between the first area m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and the second area m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;. However, different from the first radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an axial length of the first area m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is equal to an axial length of the second area m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the first area m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the second area m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; are axially symmetrical with each other with respect to the axial center of the annular portion n&prime; (the center of the axial groove). In addition, a total length of the first radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the axial direction (i.e., m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&plus;n) is larger than that of the second radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&plus;m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;&plus;n&prime;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A circumferential groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed in the upper end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which serves as a mark for distinguishing between the upper and lower directions. In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has the area which serves as the thrust bearing surface (i.e., surface constituting the thrust bearing gap of the first thrust bearing part) has dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>cl in the shape of a spiral. Further, in this embodiment, the outer and inner circumferences at the lower end and the outer and inner circumferences at the upper end are provided with chamfers respectively, the dimension of the chamfer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the outer circumference at the lower end is larger than that of the chamfers on the other portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Prior to the formation of dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an inner diameter and a percentage of surface openings of the pores (a percentage of area of the surface openings per unit area) of the inner peripheral surface of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are adjusted by means of sizing or the like. In each of the radial bearing parts R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for example, a percentage of surface openings of the radial bearing surface thereof is defined to 2% or mote but less than 10%, preferably <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to 5%, including the areas of dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>.

The percentage of surface openings of the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(the thrust bearing surface of the first thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is defined to 2% or more but less than 10%, preferably 2 to 5%, including the areas of dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the chamfer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the outer circumference at the lower end is not subjected,to the burnishing treatment (fretting treatment), so that the percentage of surface openings of the chamfer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is larger than the percentage of surface openings of the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>which constitutes the thrust bearing gap. For example, it is defined to 10% or more, preferably 15% or more. The bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> thus constructed has an air permeability of 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;10 </superscript></highlight>to 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;13</superscript></highlight>, preferably 5.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;11 </superscript></highlight>to 5.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>. In addition, the percentage of surface openings of each of chamfers on the inner circumference at the lower end, and on the inner and outer circumferences at the upper end may be the same as or smaller than that of the chamfer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.

There is a gap (X portion) larger than the radial bearing gap is formed between the annular groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (the area between the radial bearing parts R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Furthermore, a gap (Y portion) is formed around the boundary between the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>while a gap (U portion) larger than the thrust bearing gap is formed in the area of the inner diameter side of the second thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In addition, a gap (Z portion) larger than the radial bearing gap between the outer peripheral surface of the flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The tapered surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>faces the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sealing member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the predetermined gap, thereby a tapered sealing space S which is gradually increased toward the outer direction of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (the upper direction in the figure) is formed therebetween. An inner space of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> sealed with the sealing member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including the pores of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, is filled with a lubricating oil and the oil surface of the lubricating oil is in the sealed space S. The volume of the sealed space S is adjusted such that it will be larger than variations in the volume of the lubricating oil filled in the inner space of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with variations in temperature within the range of working temperature. Consequently, even though the volume of the lubricating oil changes as the temperature changes, the oil surface of the lubricating oil can be always maintained in the sealed space S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rotates, the dynamic pressure of the lubricating oil is generated in the radial bearing gaps. Thereby, the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported in the radial direction by the oil film of the lubricating oil formed in the radial bearing gaps in a non-contact manner. Thus, the first radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are constituted such that they rotatably support the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the radial direction in a non-contact manner. Simultaneously, the dynamic pressure of the lubricating oil is generated in the thrust bearing gaps. Thereby, the flange part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported in the thrust directions by the oil film of the lubricating oil formed in the thrust bearing gaps in a non-contact manner. Thus, the first thrust bearing part Si and the second thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are constituted such that they rotatably support the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in thrust directions in a non-contact manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are asymmetric with each other about the axial direction. Furthermore, the groove area (m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) having a longer length in the axial direction is located on the opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>side of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (upper side), while the groove area (m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) having a shorter length in the axial direction is located on the bottom part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>side of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (lower side). Therefore, due to the difference pressure of the drawing force for the lubricating oil between the groove areas m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to put it concretely, since the drawing force for the lubricating oil is relatively large in the groove area m<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the longer axial length, while the drawing force for the lubricating oil is relatively small in the groove area m<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having the shorter axial length, the flow of lubricating oil is generated from the inside of the radial gap of the radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the X portion. Consequently, the X portion can be kept in a positive pressure without becoming negative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the first thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, furthermore, the lubricating oil in the thrust bearing gap is drawn toward the inner diameter direction by the spiral-shaped dynamic pressure generating grooves B<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> formed on the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to supply to the Y portion. Therefore, the Y portion can be kept at a positive pressure without becoming a negative pressure. In the second thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, simultaneously, the lubricating oil in the thrust bearing gap is drawn toward the inner diameter direction by the spiral-shaped dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed on the inner bottom surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to supply to the U portion. Therefore, the U portion can be kept at a positive pressure without becoming a negative pressure. On the other hand, the chamfer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the larger percentage of surface openings is continuous to the outer diameter side of the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which constitutes the thrust bearing gap of the first thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, the lubricating oil in the pores of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is supplied to the Z portion through the surface openings of the chamfer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that the Z portion can be kept at a positive pressure without becoming a negative pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the dynamic bearing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is capable of keeping the whole portions in the inside of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at a positive pressure without causing a negative pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as the oil surface of the lubricating oil is in the sealed space S, the lubricating oil in the sealed space S is drawn by a capillary force in the direction along which the sealed space S is narrowed (the internal direction of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, i.e., the downward direction). Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent leakage of the lubricating oil from the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the outside. In addition, as the tapered surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the lubricating oil in the sealed space S receives centrifugal force during the rotation of the shaft member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be drawn along the tapered surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the direction along which the sealed space S is narrowed (the internal direction of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>: the downward direction). Therefore, the leakage of the lubricating oil can be more effectively prevented because of the drawing action of the centrifugal force in addition to the drawing action of the capillary force. In addition, the lubricating oil in the sealed space S is drawn in the internal direction (downward) of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by the pressure difference in the first radial bearing part R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the leakage of the lubricating oil can be more effectively prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, furthermore, the leakage of the lubricating oil can be more effectively prevented by applying an oil repellency agent to at lest one of the outer peripheral surface of the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the surface of the sealing member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> adjacent to the sealed space S. In an example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) as an enlarged view, an oil repellency agent f is applied on the cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the tapered surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> located on the upper side of the tapered surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the axial part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and the inner diameter side area (the area represented by a dot line in the figure) of the upper end surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the sealing member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is shown a second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is subjected to a barrel processing prior to the formation of dynamic pressure generating grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, followed by sealing treatments on the outer peripheral surface, end surfaces <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and chamfer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, respectively. In this case, the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is subjected to the sizing or the like. A medium to be used in the barrel processing does not contact with the inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Therefore, a plurality of axial grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>having their respective widths enough to prevent the contact with the media at the time of barrel processing are formed in the outer peripheral portion of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, such that these axial grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are continuous to the outer diameter side of the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which constitutes the thrust bearing gap of the first thrust bearing part S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As the sealing treatment with the barrel processing is not performed on the axial grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight>the percentage of surface openings thereof can be secured so as to be lager than that of the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>constituting the thrust bearing gap, for example, with 10% or more, preferably 15% or more. Thus, the lubricating oil in the pores of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is supplied to the Z portion through the surface openings of the axial direction groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight>so that Z portion can be kept at a positive pressure without becoming a negative pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, moreover, the dynamic pressure generating grooves formed in the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and/or the dynamic pressure generating grooves formed in the inner bottom surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be provided in the shape of herringbone. In this case, each of them may be non-symmetrical in the radial direction such that the radial dimension r<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the outer diameter side is larger than the radial dimension r<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the inner diameter side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, furthermore, the axial grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>&prime; formed in the outer peripheral portion of the bearing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may be continuous to both the upper end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the lower end surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the bearing member S. </paragraph>
