<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a packet communication, in particular to an accounting method and an accounting system in a network that information are distributed by packets between an information service provider and a plurality of portable terminals (or information terminals). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Portable terminals (or portable telephones) have rapidly come into wide use by their convenience. Under the present conditions, the portable terminals (or the portable telephones) have exceeded fixed telephone terminals. Particularly, a portable terminal is used as communication means merely by voices between the portable terminals. In addition, a portable terminal is connected to a personal computer (PC), and the like, so that the portable terminal is used as a data communication terminal with the other personal computers, and the like. Furthermore, a portable terminal (i-mode) having a function for being connected to an Internet is also used as an information terminal for carrying out an information search, or the like. Thus, it is a recent trend that the portable terminal (or portable information terminal) has high performance and multi-functions. Thereby, the portable terminals (or portable information terminals) have come into wide use, as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a case of a general telephone terminal (telephone set), the general telephone terminal (telephone set) is fixed on home or an office. Therefore, a transmitting place and a receiving place are decided by the fixed telephone terminal (telephone set). In an accounting method for accounting an user with use fee, the use fee will be decided dependent on a region where a telephone terminal of a communication partner is existing (whether the telephone terminal of the communication partner is within the city, out of the city, or in a foreign country), on a time of talking with the communication partner, and so on. On the contrary, in a case of a portable terminal, a transmitting place moves as the owner of the portable terminal moves. It is therefore impossible to apply the portable terminal with an accounting method similar to that of the above-mentioned general telephone terminal. Particularly, in a case that a portable terminal, such as the i-mode, and the like is connected to an Internet (is subjected to an Internet access) by using a packet communication, a specific accounting method is generally used. Namely, in the specific accounting method, an user of the portable terminal pays the use fee responsive to numbers of transmitted and received packets from the portable telephone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in Web review focusing the use by a dial-up connection from PC, a use of an Internet, such as transmission and reception of an electronic mail (e-mail), or the like, provision of various new services, such as distribution of graphic image, distribution of music by MP2 (multi-link protocol), program download by JAVA, and the like, have been started. In particular, amount of data downloaded to the portable terminal of the user side are greatly increased anyway, compared with conventional services focusing transmission and reception of text data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventional techniques in such a technical field or related fields are disclosed in, for example, unexamined Japanese patent publication 2000-78129, named &ldquo;accounting method of information communication network&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication 2000-78196, named &ldquo;IP network accounting system&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Sho 63-290042, named &ldquo;accounting system in a packet exchanging network&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 2-166942, named &ldquo;count system of a packet communication fee&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 4-288746, named &ldquo;communication right or wrong judging system in a communication between various kinds of packet exchanging systems&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 5-75649, named &ldquo;accounted amount calculating apparatus of a packet communication network&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 6-164578, named &ldquo;data terminal equipment&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 6-205050, named &ldquo;multi-destination processing method of a connecting apparatus for connecting LAN with broad band ISDN&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 6-237316, named &ldquo;ISDN communication processing apparatus&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 7-131557, named &ldquo;accounting system in information communication&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 7-245627, named &ldquo;packet measuring apparatus&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 9-107420, named &ldquo;detailed account processing method in a communication processing system&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 11-27322, named &ldquo;data receiving apparatus and data receiving method&rdquo;, unexamined Japanese patent publication Hei 11-355355, named &ldquo;distribution information registering method in a mobile communication network&rdquo;, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a typical example of an accounting system in a conventional packet communication network. In the conventional accounting system, an user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a terminal (for example, a portable terminal) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> communicates with a reception destination <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, that is, a server apparatus of an information service provider, by way of a packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has an exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to which an accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is connected. When the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends a transmission packet P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> makes the transmission packet P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> be received by the reception destination <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In addition, a packet that is an information from the reception destination <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is sent to the terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as a reception packet P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, by way of the packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> then transmits numbers of packets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> transmitted and received by the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at an adequate timing. Consequently, the accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> calculates the account for the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> based on the numbers of packets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional accounting system in the packet communication network has the following problems. Namely, if the specific accounting method for the use of an Internet by the dial-up connection from PC is applied, as it stands, to the Internet access using packets, an amount of accounts to be paid by the user in the Internet access using packets becomes not less than ten times as large as that in the use of an Internet by the dial-up connection from PC. This is too heavy a burden for the user. This is also a troublesome for applying new techniques, such as distribution of graphic image to the Internet access using the packet communication from the portable terminal, such as the i-mode, and the like, similarly to the use of the Internet by the dial-up connection from PC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, for contents providers (information service providers) who use the Internet and wish to put advertisements widely by Web or e-mails, their free actions are inevitably restricted under the system that the user of the portable terminal bears all of the communication fees. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</cross-reference>, description will proceed to accounting method and system in a packet communication network according to preferred embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> At first, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram for schematically showing a constitution of the accounting system in the packet communication network according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Besides, the accounting system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> has portions similar to those of the conventional accounting system in the packet communication network illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The similar portions are designated by like reference numerals for the brevity of description. Namely, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the accounting system in the packet communication network according to the first embodiment of the present invention comprises a terminal (for example, a portable terminal) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a reception destination <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, that is, a server apparatus of an information service provider, a packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and an accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In addition, the accounting system further comprises an accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which includes a database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the accounting system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends the transmission packet P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and receives, on the contrary, the reception packet P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> then transmits numbers of packets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> transmitted and received by the terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at an adequate timing. Further, accounting amendment information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is sent from the accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> calculates use fees of the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the reception destination <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, that is an information service provider (contents provider) based on the numbers of transmitted and received packets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the accounting amendment information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> then charges the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the reception destination <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for the use fees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The accounting system in the packet communication network according to this embodiment utilizes an identifier indicating a kind of information, such as music, and the like, which is to be obtained by the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a use of information, such as an advertisement, or the like. Based on the kind of information and the use of information, the use fees for accounting are decided. Further, the use fees for accounting can also be decided based on a kind of protocol of information distribution. For example, the use fees for accounting can be decided dependent on whether the information is distributed by way of an electronic mail or Web. This enables the information service provides to provide, for example, the following new services. Namely, the contents provider is charged with a graphic image used for an advertisement on Web (vainer advertisement). Further, the contents provider is charged with a part of onerous music data to provide only the part of the onerous music data, as a sample to users. Furthermore, the contents provider is charged with packet fees for direct mails by the use of electronic mails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The accounting system in the packet communication network according to the first embodiment of the present invention, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is not confined to a method of accounting by calculating only the numbers of transmitted and received packets sent from the exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Namely, the accounting system in the packet communication network according to the first embodiment of the present invention further comprises the accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which includes the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having source address of information provision, kinds of information, an accounting unit and a fee per each kind of information. The accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> investigates information included in the transmission packet P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the reception packet P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with reference to the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to output the accounting amendment information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. In addition, the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has an accounting unit and a fee per each name of a file. The accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> thereby decides the fee dependent on a use of the file. Moreover, the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has an accounting unit and a fee per each protocol. The accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is thereby capable of deciding the fee dependent on the protocol. As a result, the accounting system in the packet communication network according to the first embodiment of the present invention amends the conventional accounting information by the numbers of transmitted and received packets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by the use of the accounting amendment information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> outputted from the accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, so that the accounting system acquires new (amended) accounting information. Accordingly, the accounting system calculates fees for the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> based on the new (amended) accounting information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Hereunder, further detailed description is made about the constitution of the accounting system in the packet communication network according to the first embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the accounting system in the packet communication network according to the first embodiment has the accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in addition to the conventional constitution illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> having a specific accounting apparatus.

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(C) includes source addresses of information provisions <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, names of files <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, account fees <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and account units <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The source addresses of information provisions <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> store, similarly to those of the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(A) or <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(B), mail addresses, such as &ldquo;yyy&commat;xxx.co.jp&rdquo;, &ldquo;xxx.co.jp/zzz&rdquo;, and the like, and certain addresses capable of identifying the source of information provision, such as a name of a server as well as a name of directory, or the like. The names of files <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> store certain names of files, such as &ldquo;xxx.gif&rdquo;, &ldquo;yyy.exe&rdquo;, and the like. The account fees <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> store amendment fees, such as &ldquo;&minus;0.1 yen&rdquo;, &ldquo;&plus;0.2 yen&rdquo;, and the like each corresponding to each name of a file <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The account units <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> store units of the account fees <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, such as &ldquo;one packet&rdquo;, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, description will proceed to operations of the accounting method and system in the packet communication network according to the first embodiment of the present invention. At first, using the terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives the reception packet P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the reception destination <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by way of the packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> calculates numbers of packets of the reception packet P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and then transmits the numbers of transmitted and received packets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to the accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at an adequate timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Further, the accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> acquires a protocol, a source address of the information provision, and a name of a file from information included in the reception packet P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In addition, the accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> also acquires a kind of the file by an extension of the file. On the other hand, the accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> acquires the account fees <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the account units <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> per each protocol from the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> based on the source addresses of information provisions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the protocols <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Next, the accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> acquires the account fees <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the account units <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> per each kind of information from the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> based on the source addresses of information provisions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the kinds of information <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Further, the accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> acquires the account fees <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the account units <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> per each use of information from the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> based on the source addresses of information provisions <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the names of files <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> The accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> then transmits the acquired account fees <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and account units <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as the accounting amendment information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. As a result, the accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> carries out calculation of fees based on the numbers of transmitted and received packets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the accounting amendment information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> thereby decides the fee for the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the fee for the reception destination <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is a source of the information provision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, description will proceed to an accounting system in a packet communication network according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The accounting system in the packet communication network according to the second embodiment of the present invention is also not confined to a method of accounting by calculating only the numbers of transmitted and received packets, similarly to that of the first embodiment. However, in the second embodiment, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having source addresses of information provisions, kinds of information, accounting units and fees per each kind of information. The exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a function to investigate information included in the transmission packet P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the reception packet P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with reference to the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to output the accounting amendment information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. As a result, the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is charged with a fee based on a new accounting information in which a conventional accounting information only by the numbers of transmitted and received packets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is amended by the accounting amendment information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the accounting system in the packet communication network according to the second embodiment of the present invention comprises a terminal (for example, a portable terminal) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a reception destination (contents provider) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> within the packet communication network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> connected to the exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and thereby carries out the processing carried out by the accounting amendment apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment. Accordingly, the exchange <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> transmits not only the numbers of transmitted and received packets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> but also the accounting amendment information <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to the accounting apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, meritorious effects similar to those of the first embodiment can be obtained by the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the accounting method and system of the present invention, remarkably advantageous effects in actual use can be obtained as follows. Namely, a fee for accounting can be decided per each kind of information, such as a music obtained by an user of the packet communication network, and the like, each use of information, such as an advertisement, or the like, and each protocol. As a result, accounting suitable for contents of the information can be achieved. In other words, accounting for a part or whole of certain information can be imposed not on an user of a portable terminal but on an information service provider (contents provider), that is a reception destination. In order to achieve these effects, in the accounting method and system of the present invention, merely the accounting amendment apparatus is added and an accounting apparatus (information) is amended by the accounting amendment information of the accounting amendment apparatus. The effects can therefore be achieved readily and at a low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> While this invention has thus far been described in conjunction with several embodiments thereof, it will now be readily possible for one skilled in the art to put this invention into effect in various other manners. For example, the terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a portable terminal in the first and the second embodiments. However, the present invention is not restricted to a portable terminal. Namely, the terminal may be a general (fixed) terminal alternatively. </paragraph>
