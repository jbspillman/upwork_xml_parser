<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A less expensive power cord with a safety device detects the damage of the power lines in a cord at an earlier stage, shuts off the power, and guarantees the safety of an electric appliance and its environment. The power cord has two power lines and a detection line provided between them, and the sheath portion between the detection line and the power line is thinner than the insulating sheath material of the cord contact portion. When the power line becomes half-broken and damaged by the fatigue with the passage of time due to bendings and pulls, the broken ends of the thin lines of the power line are untwisted and contact the thin sheath portion of the detection line, a current flows through the detection line, a current difference occurs in the power line, the power shutdown device detects the difference, releases a latch, and opens a constant close interlocking switch, thereby shutting off the power. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a power cord with plug for use in an electric appliance, and more specifically to a less expensive power cord with a safety device for detecting damage of a power line in the cord at an earlier stage, shutting off the power, and guaranteeing the safety of the electric appliance and its environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There has been a conventional power cord with plug for use in supplying power to an electric appliance from a commercial power receptacle. Since the power cord is normally bent and pulled each time it is used, the repeated bendings and pulls cause fatigue with the passage of time especially at the base portion of the plug or the electric appliance, thereby often damaging the cord at these portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, to prevent the damage of the cord caused by the bendings and pulls, there have been no effective methods other than thickening a power line or a sheath. However, these methods only protect a cord against bendings and pulls, but lose the flexibility of the cord, and are poor in ease-of-use. In this situation, to improve the protection of power cords against bendings and pulls, there are a number of cases in which a power cord is reinforced by providing a cord protector for the power cord at the base portion of the plug or the electric appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a power cord provided with the above mentioned cord protector. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the cord contact portion of a power cord <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is covered with an insulating sheath material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and contains two power lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> arranged in parallel. One end of the cord (left end in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is fixed to a plug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the two power lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected to two respective plug terminals <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the plug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A cord protector <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is attached to the base portion of the plug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Thus, the base portion of the plug to which strong bending and pulling force is applied can be reinforced, thereby successfully generating a durable code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In an example often reported in the U.S., a hair dryer is carelessly dropped into a bathtub, and an electric shock accident occurs in the bathtub. Therefore, to prevent the electric shock accident, it has been made mandatory to attach a ground-fault interrupter to a plug. The ground-fault interrupter can either shut off the power by detecting a ground-fault current or shut off the power by providing a detection line for detecting a current flowing through it. The ground-fault interrupter which detects a ground-fault current can be applied when a bathtub is insulated, and the ground-fault interrupter which is provided with the detection line can be applied when a bathtub is not insulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, although a power cord is effectively reinforced by any means as by the above mentioned cord protector, the inside power lines are broken with fatigue with the passage of time with years of use. However, since the power lines of a power cord are covered with a sheath material, and are safely maintained by the sheath material, they are not completely broken and are in a half-broken state in many cases. Thus, if the power cord is used with the power lines maintained in the half-broken state, then the electrical resistance of the half-broken portion becomes high, and a large amount of heat is locally generated at this portion, thereby often causing the danger of a fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when a heater appliance such as a hair dryer, an electric ironing device, etc. is constantly used in hand, the power cord in use is subject to a heavy load. Therefore, the power cord is more seriously damaged and more easily broken than the power cords of other types of appliances. However, since the heater appliances consume larger power, a large amount of heat is generated in the above mentioned half-broken state, thereby easily causing the danger of a fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The ground-fault interrupter for preventing an electric shock accident in a bathtub as in the example in the U.S. has been developed to shut off the power if a leakage occurs when a user mishandles the appliance or if the appliance becomes wet by a careless user. Therefore, it does not prevent the danger caused by other factors, for example, an internal break, etc. from fatigue with the passage of time, etc. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been developed to solve the above mentioned problems with the conventional technology, and aims at providing a less expensive power cord with a safety device for detecting the damage of the power lines in a cord at an earlier stage, shutting off the power, and guaranteeing the safety of an electric appliance and its environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The power cord with a safety device according to the present invention is a power cord for supplying the power from a commercial power receptacle to an electric appliance, its cord contact portion is covered with an insulating sheath material, the cord contains two power lines and a detection line, a plug includes a power shutdown device for operating upon detection of the current flowing through the detection line. The detection line is provided between two power lines arranged in parallel, and the sheath portions between each of the two power lines and the detection line is thinner than the sheath portion of the cord contact portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The above mentioned detection line is covered with the sheath material having a lower melting point than the sheath material of the power line, and covered with a conductive sheath material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the power line is damaged by the fatigue with the passage of time by bendings and pulls in use, etc., the detection line and the power line more easily contact each other and make a short-circuit, thereby successfully preventing the local generation of a large amount of heat by an electric shock from a damaged portion and by use without knowing the damage. Furthermore, the occurrence of a disaster such as a fire, etc. can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The power cord with a safety device can be configured by two power lines arranged in parallel; an insulating internal sheath layer covering the power lines; a conductive sheath material provided around the internal sheath layer; an insulating external sheath layer forming a cord contact portion by covering the conductive sheath material; and a plug containing a power shutdown device operating upon detection of a current flowing through the conductive sheath material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The power shutdown device can also be configured by, for example, a leakage detecting power shutdown device, or, for example, a wet detecting power shutdown device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> With the above mentioned configuration according to the present invention, since the damaged portion of a power line contacts the detection line when internal damage occurs before the cord contact portion is damaged, the failure by the damage of the sheath of the cord contact portion of the power line, which cannot be avoided by any means other than a conventional protector, can be successfully avoided, thereby successfully avoiding a serious failure in the environment caused by a combined effect of a leakage, an electric shock, a burn, a fire, etc. occurring by the deterioration with the passage of time as well as by careless of mistaken handling. As a result, a safe and reliable power cord can be provided.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention are described, below by referring to the attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a typical sectional view of the wiring configuration of the power cord with a safety device according to an embodiment of the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is an enlarged view showing an actual configuration of the sectional view along the line A-A&prime; indicated by the arrow. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, a power cord <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by covering the cord contact portion with an insulating sheath material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, two power lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged in parallel in the insulating sheath material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided between the power lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and a plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to one end of the cord contact portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> contains a power shutdown device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> operating when it detects a current flowing through the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> when the power is supplied from the other end of the power lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the electric appliance by plugging the plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the commercial power receptacle. The power shutdown device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is obtained by connecting the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> according to the present invention to a normal leakage detecting power shutdown device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The power shutdown device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> comprises a sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a sensor coil <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> wound around the sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a switch drive unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> operating based on the output of the sensor coil <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, constant close interlocking switches <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>released by the switch drive unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in an abnormal state, and a test circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> comprising a constant open switch <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a resistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The power lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connected to the two plug terminals <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the constant close interlocking switches <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are inserted into the sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> passes outside the sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and is connected to the plug terminal <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through a resistor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the constant close interlocking switch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In a normal state, since the same amount of currents flow in the opposite directions through the power lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>inserted into the sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the induced magnetic force is offset, thereby generating no magnetic force line in the sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Therefore, no current flows through the sensor coil <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. However, if there occurs a leakage in the electric appliance not shown in the drawings attached to the other end of the power cord <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> due to a careless or mistaken handling such as a drop into a bathtub, etc., then there arises a current difference by an amount of leakage between the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) on the leakage side and the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) on the non-leakage side. In response to the amount of the current difference, a magnetic force line is generated in the sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In response to the magnetic force line, a current is generated in the sensor coil <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The current is detected by the switch drive unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The switch drive unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not shown in the attached drawings, but comprises, for example, an amplifier circuit, a latch type solenoid, etc., and a weak current from the sensor coil <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is detected by the amplifier circuit. That is, the output of the amplifier circuit closes the energized circuit in the switch drive unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and passes the power current to the latch type solenoid. Thus, the latch type solenoid operates, and the constant close interlocking switches <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are released, thereby shutting off the power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The test circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is used to confirm that the power shutdown device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> correctly operates by shutting off the power by the above mentioned effect through an artificial short-circuit of the portion subsequent to the sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the portion preceding to the sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by setting the constant open switch <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a close state by a manual external operation or a jig after connecting the plug terminals <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to a testing power circuit after assembly in the factory or before shipment from the factory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Thus, the power cord <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has the function of shutting off the power when there occurs a leakage due to common careless or mistaken handling, and further has the function of shutting off the power by early detecting an internal half-broken state due to the fatigue with the passage of time. That is, the cord contact portion of the power cord <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed such that the thickness of a sheath portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> covering the entire unit can be 1.0 mm as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, and the thickness (distance) of a sheath portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> covering the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be 0.6 mm. That is, the sheath portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed thinner than the sheath portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the cord contact portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the sheath portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is about &frac23; times as thick as the sheath portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, the thickness is not limited to this value. For example, the relationship between them can be arbitrarily set so far as the thickness of the sheath portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is smaller than the thickness of the sheath portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus, if the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>enters the half-broken state and damaged due to the fatigue with the passage of time, etc. by bendings and pulls while using the line, then the damaged and broken ends of the thin lines of the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>normally formed by twisting a number of thin lines are untwisted and easily contact the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the damaged portion of the sheath portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>normally thinner than the sheath portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> When the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> contacts the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the power is shut off by the above mentioned effect of the short circuit between the power lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Furthermore, when the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> contacts the power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the current from the plug terminal <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>flows separately through the inside (power line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and the outside (detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) of the sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Also in this case, a small current difference occurs between the power lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>encompassed by the sensor core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a typical sectional view of the configuration of the wiring of the power cord with a safety device according to another embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows the configuration of the circuit of a power shutdown device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime;. The power shutdown device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime; embedded in a plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; of a power cord <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; is an example of a wet detecting power shutdown device, and an example of a semiconductor detection circuit used in the device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to the gate of a semiconductor switching device (for example, a thyristor) <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. With the configuration, when a current flows through the detection line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the switching device <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is turned on for the circuit in the arrow B direction, a solenoid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is driven by the current flowing through a bridge circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the latch is released to open the constant close interlocking switch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the current is shut off in a moment on both sides. </paragraph>
