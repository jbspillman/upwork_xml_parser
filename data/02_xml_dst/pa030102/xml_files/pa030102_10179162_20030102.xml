<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">While both a forehead and a cheek are made in close contact to an eye position fixing portion, a space defined between an eye and a pinhole is shielded from extraneous light, and an iris is illuminated by infrared light of a lighting device. At this time, since a pupil diameter is defined in a self-control manner by receiving visible light of another lighting device, and also, a width of the iris is secured under stable condition, this iris is focused via the pinhole onto an image pick up element so that the iris can be photographed. Then, the acquired feature information of the iris is compared with registered feature information in order to execute the individual identifying operation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to an individual identifying apparatus for identifying as to whether or not a person to be identified is made coincident with a registered individual. More specifically, the present invention is directed to an individual identifying apparatus for performing individual identification from an image obtained by photographing an iris of an eye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, individual identifying apparatus capable of identifying persons from each other by employing irides of eyes are known in this field. As an example of such individual identifying apparatus, one conventional individual identifying apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei. 9-212722 is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In this drawing, the individual identifying apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is arranged by the pressure sensitive switch <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for detecting presence of the person located in front of this individual identifying apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the lighting device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for lighting face and the eyes of the person, the camera <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for photographing the iris portion of this person, the power control unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for controlling turn-ON/OFF operations of the power supplies of the lighting device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the camera <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and the identifying unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> for executing the individual identification based upon the picture of the camera <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. When presence of the person is detected by the pressure sensitive switch <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, both the power supply of the lighting device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the power supply of the camera <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are turned ON by the power control unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and then, the iris portion of the eye is photographed by the camera <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The identifying unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may confirm as to whether or not this photographed person is identical to the registered person based upon the image of this photographed iris portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the above-described conventional individual identifying apparatus, the dimension of this individual identifying apparatus is increased, and also, the high-precision camera is necessarily required so as to photograph the iris portion from the long distance, and furthermore, the camera angle thereof should be positioned in high precision. As a result, there is such a problem that the manufacturing cost of this individual identifying apparatus becomes high. In addition, there is another problem that the individual identification by this individual identifying apparatus may be readily and adversely influenced by extraneous light. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made to solve the above-described problem, and therefore, has an object to provide a low-cost individual identifying apparatus capable of identifying individuals from each other without employing a high-precision camera, while a portability of this individual identifying apparatus is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention is featured by providing an individual identifying apparatus comprising: an image pick up unit for photographing either an iris or a retina of an eye of a person to be identified; a position fixing unit for fixing a position of the photographing unit, while extraneous light is interrupted under such a condition that the eye of the person to be identified is directed opposite to the photographing unit; a lighting unit including both photograph-purpose illuminating light emitting device for emitting photograph-purpose illuminating light and visible light emitting device for emitting visible light with respect to the eye of the person to be identified inside the position fixing unit; and individual identifying unit for identifying an individual based upon a picture of the eye which is photographed by the image pick up unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Also, a second aspect of the present invention is featured by that the individual identifying apparatus further comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> a light amount control unit for changing a light amount of the lighting unit; a state output unit for outputting information corresponding to a pupil diameter of the eye which is photographed by the image pick up unit; and an individual identifying unit for identifying an individual based upon the picture of the eye photographed by the image pick up unit when the output of the state output unit is reached to a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Also, a third aspect of the present invention is featured by that the light amount control unit controls a light amount of the lighting unit to allow the output of the condition output unit to be a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, a fourth aspect of the present invention is featured by that the individual identifying apparatus further comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> an intermittent control unit for controlling at least one of the photographing operation by the image pick up unit, the light emitting operation by the lighting unit, and the identifying operation by the individual identifying unit in an intermittent operation manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Also, a fifth aspect of the present invention is featured by that the individual identifying apparatus further comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> an identification control unit for controlling the individual identifying unit based upon luminance information of an image which is photographed by the image pick up unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With employment of the above-described arrangement, while one eye of the person to be identified is interrupted, or shielded from the extraneous light and this eye is fixed with being directed opposite to the image pick up unit, the light emitted from the lighting unit is irradiated onto the eye under such a condition that the adverse influence caused by the extraneous light is eliminated, and then, this lightened eye is photographed. As a result, the iris of the eye can be clearly photographed, so that the individual identification operation can be carried out based upon the image of this photographed iris under stable condition. Also, the pupil diameter is adjusted by irradiating the visible light emitted from the lighting unit to this one eye, and such an iris when the adjusted pupil diameter becomes a predetermined pupil diameter is photographed. As a result, the individual identification operation can be carried out with less error under more stable condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also, since the eye of the person to be identified can be photographed within the short distance, such high-precision positioning operation of the image pick up unit is no longer required, and the compact individual identifying apparatus can be provided in low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the structural elements of the individual identifying apparatus are operated in the intermittent operation manner, power consumption of this individual identifying apparatus can be reduced.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be described. It should be understood that the same reference numerals are employed as those for denoting the same, or similar structural elements in the respective drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an explanatory diagram for showing an outer view of an individual identifying apparatus which is commonly used in a first embodiment to a fifth embodiment of the present invention (will be discussed later). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sectional view for explaining a structure of the individual identifying apparatus, taken along a line A-A&prime; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the drawings, a plug <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is used to supply electric power, and also used to output a signal of an identification result. This plug <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a ground terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a power supply terminal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a signal output terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A cable <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual identifying apparatus, and is used to supply electric power and signals via the plug <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with respect to an external apparatus (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A peripheral edge of a housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a convex portion. While the peripheral edge of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is depressed against either a forehead or a cheek of a person, this peripheral edge may shield an eye to be identified from extraneous light, and also may constitute an eye position fixing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which is directed opposite to an image pick up element <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Then, a pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is opened in a center of a concave portion surrounded by the eye position fixing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and this pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is employed so as to focus the eye to be identified onto the image pick up element <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Further, a <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> having an eye shape is drawn, while the pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is set to a center. This <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> may induce the eye to be identified to a focusing point in order that an iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be easily photographed. Also, as a lighting light source used to photograph the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is provided on an upper portion of an inner edge of the eye position fixing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, while this lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is constructed of a light emitting element for emitting infrared rays, for example, an infrared light emitting diode. Similarly, another lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is provided at a lower portion of the inner edge of the eye position fixing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so as to define widening (spread) of a pupil diameter, while this lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is constituted by a light emitting element for emitting visible light, for instance, a green light emitting diode. Also, an electronic circuit capable of realizing an individual identification function (will be discussed later) is built in the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram for indicating an arrangement of an individual identifying apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention. An image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is employed so as to photograph an iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a single eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes an image pick up element <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and an image signal processing unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The image pick up element <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is a CCD image sensor having a sensitivity as to infrared rays. The image signal processing unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> performs a signal amplification, an A/D conversion, and other signal process operation. An individual identifying unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> executes individual identification operation based upon image information of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This individual identifying unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> includes a register memory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and an identifying device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As to the first embodiment of the present invention with employment of the above-described arrangement, operations thereof will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> First, since electric power is supplied from an external source (not shown) via the plug <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the individual identifying apparatus of this first embodiment, operations of the respective units of this individual identifying apparatus are commenced. Subsequently, a single eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of a human being, or of an animal is reached toward the pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. At this time, when a subject to be identified is a person, the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> may constitute a target while the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is approached, so that a positional relationship between the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be easily made coincident with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When either the forehead <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or the cheek <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is made in close contact with the eye position fixing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a space defined between the single eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is shielded with respect to the extraneous light. While the infrared light is entered into this eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> from the lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, since the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the person has no sensitivity as to the entered infrared light, the eye <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may feel this condition as a dark scene and a pupil of this eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is tried to be widened. However, since the visible light is also entered into the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> from the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, widening (spread) of the pupil may be suppressed. As previously explained, since a width of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be secured, this iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having such a width is illuminated by the infrared light having a sufficiently high illuminance level emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and then, the illuminated iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is focused via the pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> onto the image pick up element <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> having the sensitivity of the infrared light, so that such a sharp image of both an shape and a pattern of this iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be acquired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The image of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> acquired in the above-described manner is converted into an electric signal by the image pick up element <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and thereafter, this electric signal is converted by the image signal processing unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> into such an image format which may be easily processed by the individual identifying unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> While feature information as to irides to be identified has been previously stored in the register memory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, the identifying device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> compares feature information as to the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> acquired based upon the output information derived from the image signal processing unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with the feature information of the iris stored in the register memory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. If a difference of these compared feature information is located within a predetermined range, then the identifying device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> identifies that the checked iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made incident with the registered iris, and then, encrypts this identified result to output this encrypted result via the plug <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to an external appliance (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the signal of the identification result may be applied to such a security function as a password used to identify a user in an external appliance, and also, to various sorts of applications, for example, locking/releasing operations of a key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As previously explained, in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, since the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to be identified may define the dimension of the pupil thereof in a self-definition manner without being adversely influenced by the extraneous light, the compact individual identifying apparatus having the simple arrangement can be realized, by which the image of the iris can be photographed under stable condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram for indicating an arrangement of an individual identifying apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The individual identifying apparatus of the second embodiment includes a light amount control unit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and a state output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in addition to the arrangement of the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and an identifying device <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> replaced with the identifying device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The light amount control unit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> controls a light amount of the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The condition output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> outputs information corresponding to the pupil diameter of the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> photographed by the image pickup unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The identifying device <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> executes the individual identification while using this information as a condition. It should be understood that the same reference numerals shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be employed as those for denoting the same, or similar structures, and explanations thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As to the second embodiment of the present invention with employment of the above-described arrangement, operations thereof will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> When either the forehead <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or the cheek <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is made in close contact with the eye position fixing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a space defined between the single eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is shielded with respect to the extraneous light, and also, visible light emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the light amount of which is controlled by the light amount control unit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, is entered into the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> approached to the eye position fixing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. As a result, the size of the pupil of the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> becomes a preselected dimension. As previously explained in the first embodiment, while widening of the pupil is suppressed under stable condition, a width of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be secured, and also, both a shape and a pattern of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which are illuminated by the infrared light emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, may be clearly photographed by the image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Then, the image of the photographed iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is converted into an electric signal by the image pick up element <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and thereafter, this electric signal is converted by the image signal processing unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> into such an image format which may be easily processed by the individual identifying unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Then, this image format signal is supplied to the identifying device <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the state output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The state output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> outputs to the identifying device <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, such information corresponding to the photographed pupil diameter of the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. This identifying device <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> conducts feature information of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in correspondence with the output information of the image signal processing unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> when the pupil diameter information supplied from the state output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may become an optimum condition with respect to an individual identification. Then, the identifying device <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> compares this conducted feature information of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with the feature information of the iris to be identified which has been previously stored in the register memory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and thereafter, encrypts the identification result to output this encrypted identification result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As previously explained, in accordance with the second embodiment, the light amount of the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is controlled by the light amount control unit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> so as to control the pupil diameter of the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to become a predetermined dimension thereof, and further, the iris information at such a time when the pupil diameter may become the optimum condition with respect to the individual identification can be acquired by the condition output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, precision of the individual identification can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 3 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram for indicating an arrangement of an individual identifying apparatus according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The individual identifying apparatus of the third embodiment includes a light amount control unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, while this light amount control unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> controls the light amount of the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> employed in the second embodiment based upon the output of the state output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that the same reference numerals shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will be employed as those for denoting the same, or similar structures, and explanations thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As to the third embodiment of the present invention with employment of the above-described arrangement, operations thereof will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The state output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> produces information corresponding to the pupil diameter of the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and then, outputs this produced information to both the identifying device <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the light amount control unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. The light amount control unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> controls a light amount of the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> based upon this information. The illumination light emitted from the lighting <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is entered into the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. As a result, as previously explained in the first embodiment, while widening of the pupil is suppressed, a width of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be secured, and also, both a shape and a pattern of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which are illuminated by the infrared light emitted from the lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, may be clearly photographed by the image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The state output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> produces information in response to the iris diameter from the image of the photographed iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this manner, such a control close loop may be formed from the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> via the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the condition output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the light amount control unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> to the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in this sequence. As a consequence, the pupil diameter of the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is correctly controlled to become the proper dimension, and both the shape and the pattern of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be more clearly photographed by the image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, since the iris information at such a time when the pupil diameter may become the optimum condition with respect to the individual identification can be acquired by the condition output unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, precision of the individual identification can be highly improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 4 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram for indicating an arrangement of an individual identifying apparatus according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. The individual identifying apparatus of the fourth embodiment is arranged by newly employing an intermittent control unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in the individual identifying apparatus of the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, while this intermittent control unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> controls the image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the individual identifying unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in an intermittent operation manner. It should be understood that the same reference numerals shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be employed as those for denoting the same, or similar structures, and explanations thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The intermittent control unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> controls input/output operations of signals as to the image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the individual identifying unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, so that the functions of the respective units can be intermittently operated, or intermittently stopped. Also, since the intermittent control unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> controls to drive the lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the light emitting operations thereof can be controlled. Alternatively, this intermittent control unit <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may ON/OFF-control a supply of electric power to the respective units, separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As previously described, in accordance with the fourth embodiment of the present invention, in addition to the above-described effect of the first embodiment, the operations defined from the image pick up operation of the iris <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> up to outputting of the individual identification result can be carried out in the intermittent manner. Furthermore, either a portion or all of power supplying operations under the control management is interrupted during a rest time period, so that reductions of power consumption can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 5 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a block diagram for indicating an arrangement of an individual identifying apparatus according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. The individual identifying apparatus of the fifth embodiment is arranged by newly employing an identification control unit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> in the individual identifying apparatus of the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, while this identification control unit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> derives luminance information from image information photographed by the image pickup unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and operates the individual identifying unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in such a case that a level of this derived luminance information exceeds a predetermined value. It should be understood that the same reference numerals shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be employed as those for denoting the same, or similar structures, and explanations thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As to the fifth embodiment of the present invention with employment of the above-described arrangement, operations thereof will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> First, when individual identification is commenced, the single eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the person is approached toward the pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. At this time, since the single eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is located far from both the lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> until the single eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is reached to a predetermined position required for eye photographing operation, an illuminance level at this single eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> becomes a shortage of the necessary illuminance level, and thus, luminance of the photographed image is brought into a low luminance condition. The identification control unit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> separates a luminance signal from a picture signal obtained by the image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so as to derive such a luminance information, and when the luminance level of this derived luminance information is lower than, or equal to a preselected value, the identification control unit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> executes the control operation in such a manner that either a portion or all of power supplies to the individual identifying unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is interrupted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is approached to the pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and both the forehead <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the cheek <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are made in close contact to the eye position fixing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the space defined between the eye <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is shielded from the extraneous light, so that a sufficiently high illuminance level at the eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be secured by both the lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Then, a luminance level of a picture signal derived from the image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which photographs this sufficiently illuminated eye <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be increased and then may exceed a predetermined value. At this stage, the identification control unit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> controls to commence the supply of electric power to the individual identifying unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, so that this individual identifying unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> commences the individual identifying operation based upon the output information of the image pick up unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As previously explained, in accordance with the fifth embodiment, in addition to the above-described effect achieved by the first embodiment, the individual identifying operation can be arbitrarily carried out, so that the reduction of the power consumption can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that in the descriptions of the first embodiment to the fifth embodiment, the iris is photographed as the information of the individual identification. Alternatively, even when a retina is photographed, the individual identifying operation of the present invention may be similarly carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Also, such an example has been described. That is, the feature information as to the irides of the subject to be identified has been previously stored in the register memory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, even when images obtained during registering operation are stored in this register memory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a similar effect may be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Also, such an example has been explained. That is, the pinhole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is employed to focus the iris image. Alternatively, a lens may be employed to focus the iris image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Also, the lighting device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the lighting device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are arranged at the upper and lower portions of the inner edge of the eye position fixing portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, these lighting devices <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be arranged on right and left portions of this inner edge. Furthermore, even when these lighting devices <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be arranged in either a linear-shaped light source or a plane-shaped light source, a similar effect may be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In addition, such an example has been explained in which the individual identifying apparatus is connected via the plug <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the external appliance. Alternatively, even when other connection modes such as connectors, terminal boards, and appliance built-in modes are employed, a similar effect may be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As previously described in detail, in accordance with the present invention, while the eye corresponding to the subject to be identified is shielded from the extraneous light, the iris can be photographed by irradiating the infrared light to this iris at the sufficiently high luminance level under such a condition that the pupil diameter is defined by using the visible light. As a consequence, the individual identifying operation can be carried out in high precision under stable condition without being adversely influenced by the extraneous light. Also, while such a high-precision camera is not employed, the individual identifying operation can be carried out in high practical levels by the low-cost individual identifying apparatus having the superior portability. </paragraph>
