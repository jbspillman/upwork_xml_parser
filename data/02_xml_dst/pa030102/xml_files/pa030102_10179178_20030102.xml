<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention will be explained below with reference to the drawings, wherein like numbers are designated by like reference characters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A fixing structure for a storage device of the present embodiment has been developed for a coin case for an automobile. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the coin case itself comprises, like the proposed coin case, a prismatic housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fixed in a mounting hole formed in an instrument panel on the side of a vehicle member, and a box-like storage member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> supported in the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the storage member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be opened and closed. Each of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the storage member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are integrally formed of resin material, which is relatively hard and has low toughness such as ABS resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is based on the above-described structure as a precondition. This embodiment is characterized in that a pair of frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> integrally provides with a plurality of resilient leg pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C which are retained to the hole edges of a mounting hole of the instrument panel are mounted to an outer periphery of an opening edge of the prismatic housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The pair of frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are positioned opposed to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have symmetrical U-shaped cross sections. Each of the frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are integrally formed of polyacetal which is resin material having greater toughness than that of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> more concretely, a front surface wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is notched to form the wide resilient leg piece <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A which projects outward. A pair of rails <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for guiding two projections <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on a side surface of the storage member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed inside the front surface wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A resilient pawl <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> across which the projection <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the storage member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rides in a ratchet manner is formed between the rails <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, a narrow resilient leg piece <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B which largely projects outward is projected from one side wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A lock pawl <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is retained to a recess <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> formed in an angle portion of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed in the vicinity of the resilient leg piece <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. The other side wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed with a wide resilient leg piece <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C which is similar to that on the side of the front surface wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by notching. A lock pawl <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is retained in a recess <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> formed in the angle portion of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed in the vicinity of the resilient leg piece <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C. Here, polyacetal is employed as the resin material having excellent toughness in this embodiment, the present invention can of course be constituted even if engineering plastic such as polycarbonate, denatured polyphenylene oxide and polyamide is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, free ends of the one side wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the other side wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of each of the frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are provided with bent pieces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> swelling outward. When each of the frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are mounted to the outer periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the bent piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is brought into abutment against a rib wall <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is bent. With this, wobbling of the frame member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed with notch windows <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> toward which the pair of rails <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the opposite sides face. The housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also formed with supporting pieces <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which sandwich the side edges of the frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the opposite sides of the recess <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The rib wall <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided in parallel to the supporting piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a deeper side of the rib wall <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When the coin case is fixed in a mounting hole H formed in the instrument panel P under the fixing structure of the above structure, a state in which the storage member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is supported in the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is obtained first. Then, the pair of frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are brought into abutment against the opposite sides of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in this state, the frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are strongly pushed against the opposite sides. Then, the lock pawls <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are retained to the corresponding recesses <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the side edges of the frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are sandwiched between the inside of the supporting pieces <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the same time. With this, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the pair of frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can reliably be mounted to the outer periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> After this state was obtained, the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is pushed into the mounting hole H of the instrument panel P from a rear end of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The resilient leg pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C are bent inward by the hole edges of the mounting hole H and pass through the mounting hole H. After the resilient leg pieces have passed through, the end tips of the resilient leg pieces are retained in the hole edges of the mounting hole H. With this, the coin case is mounted to the instrument panel P as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The resilient leg pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C are integrally formed on the frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and made of a resin having a greater toughness than that of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the resilient leg piece is sufficiently bent inside and outside by its resiliency and resiliently retained in the hole edge of the mounting hole H and thus, both the mounting condition and mounting state are excellent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Any of the pair of frame members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes the front surface wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and both the side walls <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>defining the U-shape, and each of the front surface wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and both the side walls <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>includes the resilient leg pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C. Therefore, each of the four surfaces of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has one or two resilient leg pieces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C. Thus, the fixing state of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is extremely stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When the storage member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is opened or closed, the two projections <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the side surface of the storage member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are guided by the pair of rails <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and moved. The pair of rails <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are integrally formed on the frame member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is made of polyacetal which is resin material having greater abrasion resistance than that of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the storage member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be moved extremely smoothly. </paragraph>
