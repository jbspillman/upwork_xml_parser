<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to handle of luggage and more particularly to a bezel luggage having a safety arrangement for preventing hand from being hurt in retracting handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A conventional wheeled luggage is always equipped with a retractable handle. Accordingly, a recessed bezel is a necessary element in luggage for receiving a retracted handle. In general, bezel is provided on the top rear portion of luggage. A great number of patents worldwide have been disclosed related to the improvement of bezel. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,566,798 to Tsai entitled &ldquo;Trunk With A Concealable Retractable Handle&rdquo; and Taiwanese Utility Model Publication No. 387,218 entitled &ldquo;Bumping Prevented Device for Luggage Handle&rdquo; both disclose a small recess for hand to insert into in addition to the large recess of bezel. The difference of them is that the small recess is located below the large recess in the former while an additional bumping prevented device further provided above the large recess in the latter. The purpose of small recess is for providing a passage for hand to insert into bezel to grip handle grip easily. However, in the former, the problem of hurting fingers in bezel while retracting handle has not been considered. Such may be best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, fingers F are safe before handle grip H is retracted into bezel R. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, when handle grip H is pushed down quickly thumb T is squeezed at the edge C between handle grip H and top of luggage. Since the pushing force is strong if the retracting of handle is quick thumb T tends to hurt in such case. To solve the problem mentioned above, the latter further provides an additional bumping prevented device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the recess <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which is located at upper portion of vertical wall of the bezel. However, the device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is made of sponge which tends to be easily worn after use for a period of time. Such may also have thumb T to hurt the upper edge or lower edge of the recess <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of bezel as mentioned above. Thus, improvement exists. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a description of a first embodiment of safe bezel of wheeled luggage in accordance with the invention will be detailed below. The luggage comprises a main body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a bezel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the top rear portion of the body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a retractable handle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a top handle grip <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and two sets of wheels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the rear bottom portion of the body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> specifically, bezel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a body <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> including a front upper side <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, two arcuate sides <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and a rear lower side <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a vertical portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a horizontal portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, two spaced tunnels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> near sides of horizontal portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> sleeved on two handle rods of handle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a first recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> surrounded by horizontal portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and rear lower side <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a second recess <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> surrounded by front upper side <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and vertical portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> wherein the latter two elements are the most important ones, i.e., the characteristics of the invention. The purpose of recesses <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are for providing passages for hand to insert into bezel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to grip handle grip <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> easily while safely. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, fingers F and thumbs T are safe before pushing handle grip <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> down. Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, handle grip <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> gripped by fingers F and thumb T is pushed down safely and quickly until handle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fully retracted onto a space defined by vertical portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and horizontal portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. At this time, there is still a sufficient space left between handle grip <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and second recess <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and between handle grip <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and first recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> respectively. Hence, fingers F and thumb T are protected. This eliminates the drawback of prior art of possibly hurting thumb T in above retracting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that to facilitate passage for hand to insert into the bezel to grip the handle grip easily, according to the first embodiment of the invention, the recesses <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are of inverted gable shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, according to the second embodiment of the invention, the shapes of recesses <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A may be varied. For example, recesses both are smoothly concave but sizes different. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, according to the third embodiment of the invention, second recess <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A is of a smoothly concave shape, while the first recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B is substantially of a parallelepiped for the purpose of further increasing a receiving space for hand to insert into the bezel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> While the invention herein disclosed has been described by means of specific embodiments, numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention set forth in the claims. </paragraph>
