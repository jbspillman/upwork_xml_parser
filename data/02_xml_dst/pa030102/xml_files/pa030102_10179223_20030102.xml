<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a die cushion apparatus for a press machine. In particular, the invention relates to a feature in the operating mechanism of a die cushion apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, with a single-acting press, when a cylindrical container, for instance, is pressed, the blank is prevented from being wrinkled at the periphery thereof. That is, the press is provided with a die, and a punch is arranged in the lower mold. The punch is fixed to the bolster. A blank holder is provided outside the punch to support the periphery of the blank. This blank holder is supported by cushion pins attached to a die cushion apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The lower structure of a conventional press machine is described referring to drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional side view of the lower structure of a press machine incorporating a conventional die cushion apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The lower structure <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the press machine is provided with a die cushion apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, a blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a punch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a bolster <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a press bed <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a slide <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The press bed <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is the lower structure of the press frame, and is connected to the upper structure by means of an upright member, and supports the weight of the whole press. The bolster <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the lower surface of which is resting on the press bed <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is a base that supports the punch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The punch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a lower die, the lower surface of which is supported by the bolster <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is an upper mold, the upper surface of which is attached to a slide <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The slide <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> holds the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is supported on the press frame in a manner such that it is free to move up and down, and is driven up and down by a drive mechanism. The blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a device that sandwiches the periphery of the blank between the upper surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the machine presses the blank between the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the punch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also a device that supports the blank after the pressing process is finished and transfers it to an unloading device, and the lower surface of the holder is supported by the die cushion apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The die cushion apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is a device for supporting the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and is attached to the press bed <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Here, the functions that the die cushion apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> must provide are described. The primary function is the requirement to reduce the noise and vibration produced by the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the punch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> during the pressing process (this is called the cushion function). In addition, another function of the apparatus is to clamp the outer periphery of the blank between the lower surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the upper surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the blank holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to prevent the outer periphery of the blank from being creased when the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> presses the blank (this is called the crease-pressing function). Also, to protect the outer periphery of the blank from being damaged when the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> passes bottom dead center and starts to rise, the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that supports the blank is locked so that it does not travel past the bottom dead center position (this is called the locking function). Furthermore, this locking function is preferably also capable of lowering the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the blank resting on it from the bottom dead center position by a predetermined distance (for example, about 3 mm). Moreover, when the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> passes bottom dead center and travels to the top dead center, the blank must be quickly transferred to an unloading device. For this purpose, another function is required that is to lift the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that supports the blank by a predetermined distance (for example, about 35 mm) and then stop the holder (this is called the secondary lifting function). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Next, the construction of a conventional die cushion apparatus is described. The die cushion apparatus is composed of pusher pins <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, a pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, a hydraulic servo cylinder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, a hydraulic servo valve <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, a cushion stroke sensor <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, a hydraulic unit <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and a hydraulic servo controller <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, to provide the aforementioned functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The pusher pins <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are rod-shaped structures that support the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The pusher pins <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> penetrate the bolster <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, support the lower surface of the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the top end thereof, and are supported by the pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> at the bottom end thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is a structural body that supports the pusher pins <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and is disposed below the bolster <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a manner such that it is free to move in the up/down direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are air-type RAM cylinders that support the pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> from below, and are installed on the press bed <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The cylinder members of the pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are fixed to the lower surface of the pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and the lower ends of the RAM piston members are supported by the press bed <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The cylinder members engage with the RAM piston members in such a manner that they are free to move up and down. The pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are connected through air piping to an air source (not illustrated). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic servo cylinder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is a dual-rod-type hydraulic servo cylinder which is attached to the press bed so that the rods of which can move freely in the up/down direction. The upper rod <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> is connected to the pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic servo valve <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is a servo control valve for the hydraulic servo cylinder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, that drives the upper rod <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic servo cylinder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> with a preferred stroke, operating force and speed under the control of the hydraulic servo controller <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The cushion stroke sensor <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is a sensor for measuring the travel of the pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the output of which is transmitted to the hydraulic servo controller <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic unit <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is a hydraulic unit dedicated to the hydraulic servo cylinder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, and supplies the hydraulic servo cylinder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> with an operating fluid through the hydraulic servo valve <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic servo controller <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> is a control device that actuates the hydraulic servo valve <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, and outputs control signals to the hydraulic servo valve <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> based on positional information sent from the cushion stroke sensor <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Next, the procedure by which the die cushion apparatus performs the required functions is described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the movement of the die passing through points <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the movement of the blank holder passing through points <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The movements of the lower surface of the die moving up and down and the upper surface of the blank holder moving up and down are shown with elapsed time on the abscissa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The movement curve of the die is similar to that of a sine wave, although it may differ depending on the mechanism of the press machine. The top and bottom of the movement curve are called top dead center point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and bottom dead center point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the die is located at the top dead center point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> remains stationary at an intermediate predetermined point <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> between the top dead center point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the bottom dead center point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moves down from the top dead center point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> along the movement curve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and reaches the bottom dead center point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> while pressing the blank against the punch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is pushed down by the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and moves to the bottom dead center point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, the outer periphery of the blank is clamped between the upper surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lower surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and is pressed with a predetermined force produced by the pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The force prevents the outer periphery of the blank from being creased. Also, since the die cushion apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> presses the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> upwards with a predetermined clamping force created by the pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the noise and vibration that would otherwise be produced between the upper and lower molds during the pressing process is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> passes the bottom dead center point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and moves along the rising curve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the hydraulic servo controller <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> detects information sent from the cushion stroke sensor <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> about the travel of the pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, controls the hydraulic servo cylinder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> via the hydraulic servo valve <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, and stops the pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> by opposing the force from the pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. In addition, the hydraulic servo cylinder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> lowers the pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> by a predetermined distance (for instance, about 3 mm). Consequently, the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with the blank, resting on it, is prevented from moving upwards at the bottom dead center point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and is moved further down from the bottom dead center point by a predetermined distance (for example, about 3 mm) to the lower position <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When the die rises from the bottom dead center point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> towards the top dead center point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the hydraulic servo cylinder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> raises the pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> by a predetermined distance (for instance, about 35 mm) to position <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and stops the pad thereof. The blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on which the blank is resting stops at the position <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> at a predetermined elevation (for example, about 35 mm). An unloader receives the blank resting on the blank holder, and sends it to a subsequent process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> reaches the top dead center point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the hydraulic servo cylinder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> lifts the pusher pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to the initial standby position <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> remains at the intermediate predetermined position <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> between the top dead center point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the bottom dead center point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the condition has returned to the initial status of the cycle. Subsequently, this cycle is repeated and pressing work is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the case of the aforementioned die cushion apparatus, because a hydraulic servo cylinder is used to control the position of the pusher pad, the apparatus has the advantage that the movement can be freely chosen to provide the preferred positions, however on the other hand, there are disadvantages caused by the use of the hydraulic servo cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> First, the hydraulic servo system must use an operating fluid which is cleaner than that of conventional hydraulic devices. If the cleanliness of the oil becomes even slightly reduced, a servo-lock phenomenon seen only in hydraulic servo devices occurs, causing the hydraulic servo cylinder to stop. Therefore, the cleanliness of the operating fluid should be maintained at a specified high level, so controlling the cleanliness of the operating fluid is a considerable burden. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Secondly, since the hydraulic servo valve controls the hydraulic servo cylinder, there is a time delay in the response of the servo system. The hydraulic servo controller sends a control signal to the hydraulic servo valve at a predetermined timing taking the delay into consideration. Work to set the timing must be done very precisely, and sometimes, the position of the sensor must be readjusted. If the pressing speed is changed or the dies are changed, the control system must be readjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the die cushion apparatus using a conventional hydraulic servo system is expensive and is difficult to handle and maintain, which is a practical problem. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention aims at solving the above-mentioned problems, and provides a die cushion apparatus that is less expensive and can be easily handled and maintained, compared to a conventional die cushion apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To achieve the object described above, the die cushion apparatus according to the present invention that can hold the periphery of a blank during the process of pressing the blank using dies, is provided with a support member that can hold the blank, gas pressure cylinders that push up the support member, a hydraulic cylinder of which the upper rod is connected to the support member, a pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting with a piston that partitions the interior of the converter into an oil chamber that communicates with the oil chamber of the hydraulic cylinder on the side of the aforementioned rod and a gas chamber, a check valve that allows oil to flow from the oil chamber on the side opposite to the above-mentioned rod to the oil chamber on the side of the aforementioned rod, and a drain port that communicates with the oil chamber on the side of the aforementioned rod of the hydraulic cylinder; when the die passes the bottom dead center point, the drain port is closed, and when the die is moving up from the bottom dead center point to the top dead center point, the pressure in the gas chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting is reduced and the piston is driven to the gas chamber side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to the above-mentioned configuration of the present invention, the support member supports the blank from below, the gas pressure cylinders push the support member upwards, the upper rod of the hydraulic cylinder is connected to the support member, and the above-mentioned rod, support member and blank are pushed upwards as a single unit by the gas pressure cylinders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The check valve prevents oil from flowing from the oil chamber on the aforementioned rod side to the oil chamber at the opposite end, closes the drain port communicating with the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder, and can confine oil in the oil chamber on the aforementioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting is provided with a piston that partitions the interior into an oil chamber communicating with the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder and a gas chamber, oil from the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder can be transferred into the oil chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting, by moving the piston towards the gas chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Oil in the oil chamber on the aforementioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder can be confined by closing the drain port when the die passes the bottom dead center point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The operating fluid in the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder can be transferred into the oil chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting by decreasing the pressure in the gas chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting and allowing the piston to move towards the gas chamber side during the process of moving the die from bottom dead center to top dead center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In addition, die cushion apparatus according to the present invention is provided with a pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking, with a piston that partitions the interior into an oil chamber communicating with the oil chamber on the aforementioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder and a gas chamber; when the die passes the bottom dead center point, the pressure in the gas chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking is increased and the piston is moved towards the oil chamber side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to the above-mentioned configuration of the present invention, the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking is provided with a piston that partitions the interior into the oil chamber communicating with the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder and the gas chamber; by moving the piston towards the oil chamber side, the operating fluid can be transferred into the oil chamber on the aforementioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder while the die is passing through the bottom dead center point. As the piston is moved towards the oil chamber side by increasing the pressure in the gas chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking, the operating fluid in the oil chamber of the locking pneumo-hydraulic converter can be transferred into the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the die cushion apparatus according to the present invention, the above-mentioned drain port is a hole that penetrates the wall of the oil chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking, the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking closes the drain port when it is moved to the oil chamber side, and the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking opens the drain port, when it is moved to the gas chamber side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Using the aforementioned configuration of the present invention, oil in the oil chamber of the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder can be drained through a hole that penetrates the wall of the oil chamber in the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking. When the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking is moved to the oil chamber side, the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking closes the aforementioned drain port. Once the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking is moved to the gas chamber side, the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking opens the drain port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In addition, the die cushion apparatus according to the present invention is devised such that the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking is located in the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> According to the aforementioned configuration of the present invention, the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking is installed in the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting, and the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking can be integrated into a single body with the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the die cushion apparatus of the present invention is configured in such a manner that the aforementioned drain port always communicates with the hole that penetrates the wall of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the above-mentioned configuration of the present invention, the aforementioned drain port can always communicate with the hole penetrating the wall of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting, and oil in the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder can be drained through the hole penetrating the wall of the oil chamber in the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking and the hole that penetrates the wall of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the die cushion apparatus according to the present invention is composed such that the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting is built into the cylinder of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking. The above-mentioned configuration of the present invention enables the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting to be installed in the cylinder of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking and the pneumo-converters for secondary lifting and locking can be integrated into a single body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In addition, the die cushion apparatus based on the present invention incorporates pneumo-hydraulic converters consisting of pneumo-hydraulic-based intensifiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the configuration mentioned above according to the present invention, the pneumo-hydraulic converters can be driven by a low-pressure gas because the pneumo-hydraulic converters are pneumo-hydraulic-based intensifiers. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The construction of the die cushion apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention is described below. The cushion apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is composed of pusher pins <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a pusher pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (acting as a supporting structure), pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, changeover valves <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, a cushion stroke sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, a hydraulic unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, a controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, an oil pressure tank <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, and an operating cylinder <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The construction of the pusher pins <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, pusher pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is identical to that of a conventional die cushion apparatus, therefore, no further description is given here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is a dual-rod-type ordinary hydraulic cylinder, and is installed on a press bed so that the rod can move up and down freely. The upper rod is connected to the pressure pad. For the convenience of description, the oil chamber on the side of the upper rod is called the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, and the oil chamber on the opposite side, the lower oil chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The check valve <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is provided in the hydraulic cylinder piston <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The check valve <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> allows oil to flow from the lower oil chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, and stops flow in the reverse direction thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The changeover valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is a 3-port electromagnetic changeover valve, equipped with a secondary lifting changeover valve <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and a locking changeover valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Each valve <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> connects an air source to the equipment when energized, and vents air in the equipment to atmosphere when power is cut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The cushion stroke sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> measures the travel of the pusher pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the output of which is transmitted to the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The hydraulic unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is a hydraulic unit for the hydraulic cylinder, and supplies pressurized fluid to the oil pressure tank. The controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> controls the changeover valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in response to signals sent from the cushion stroke sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The oil pressure tank <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is a tank for storing operating fluid sent from the hydraulic unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The oil pressure tank <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> communicates with the lower oil chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> through hydraulic piping, and further communicates with the operating cylinder <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through hydraulic piping and a flow regulator valve <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The operating cylinder <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> communicates with the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Next, the construction of the operating cylinder <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is described. The operating cylinder <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is provided with a pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting and a pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for locking; the pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for locking is installed in the piston <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting of the pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting is comprised of a cylinder <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting, piston <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting and an air feed pipe <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting. The cylinder <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting is provided with an oil chamber <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting and an air chamber <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting. The oil chamber <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting and the air chamber <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting are cylindrical spaces with different diameters, aligned on the same axis as the axis of the cylinder <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting. The end of the cylindrical space on the oil chamber side is open, and the end thereof on the air chamber side is closed. The diameter of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting is smaller than the diameter of the air chamber <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting. The air feed pipe <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> communicates with the air chamber <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The piston <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting is composed of an oil-chamber piston with a diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting and an air-chamber piston with a diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the air chamber <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting, arranged on the same axis. In addition, the piston <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is provided with a cylindrical compartment filled with air, on the air-chamber side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In addition, the drain port <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting is provided on the wall of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting. The drain port <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting is located in such a position that even when the piston <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting travels over the entire stroke, the port is covered by the piston <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting and is closed thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for locking is provided with a cylinder <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> for locking and a piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking. The outer surface of the cylinder <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> for locking also functions as the piston <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> An oil chamber <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for locking and an air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking are provided around the cylinder <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> for locking. The oil chamber <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for locking and the air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking are cylindrical spaces with different diameters, aligned on the same axis as the axis of the cylinder <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> for locking. The end of the cylindrical space on the oil chamber side is open to the oil chamber <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting, and the end thereof on the air chamber side is closed. The diameter of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for locking is smaller than the diameter of the air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking. The air feed pipe <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> communicates with the air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking is structured in such a manner that an oil-chamber piston with a diameter slightly less than the diameter of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for locking is connected to an air-chamber piston with a diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking, on the same axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In addition, a drain port <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> for locking is located on the wall of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for locking. The drain port <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> for locking becomes open to the oil chamber for locking when the piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking moves all the way to the side of the air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking; when the piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking moves all the way to the side of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for locking, the port is closed as it is covered by the piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking. Besides, a passage way that communicates from the drain port <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> for locking to the drain port <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting is formed in the outer surface of the piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the die cushion apparatus is described referring to the drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a hydro-pneumatic system diagram of the die cushion apparatus. For easy understanding, the pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting and the pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for locking are shown separately. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> show the status at each stage of the processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> First, the die is located at the top dead center point, and the blank holder is in a standby position at an intermediate predetermined location between the top and bottom dead center points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> (Process A) The changeover valve <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting is energized, and the changeover valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> for locking is deenergized. The piston <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting in the pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting travels to the side of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting, so the volume of the space at the oil chamber <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting side is a minimum. The piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking in the pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for locking travels to the air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking side, so the volume of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for locking is a maximum. The hydraulic cylinder piston <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> rises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> descends from the top dead center point along the movement path and reaches the bottom dead center point with presses the blank against the punch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is lowered to the bottom dead center point as it is pressed by the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> presses the upper rod <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> downwards through the pusher pins <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the pusher pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is pushed downwards by the upper rod <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Operating fluid in the lower oil chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> passes into the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> through the check valve <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> At that time, the outer periphery of the blank is clamped between the upper surfaces of the blank holder and lower surface of die, and is pressed vertically with a predetermined force produced by the pneumatic cylinders, so the outer periphery of the blank is prevented from being creased. Also, since the die cushion apparatus pushes the die upwards with a predetermined force created by the pneumatic cylinders, noise and vibration that might otherwise be produced by the upper and lower dies during the pressing process are reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> (Process B) When the die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> passes the bottom dead center point and starts to rise, the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> inputs a signal detecting the movement of the pusher pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> sent from the cushion stroke sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and at the same time energizes the changeover valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> for locking. The air pressure in the air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking of the penumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for locking is increased, and the piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking moves to the side of oil chamber <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for locking The piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking closes the drain port <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> for locking. Operating fluid in the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is trapped in place. When the piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking moves to the side of the oil chamber for locking, operating fluid in the oil chamber <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for locking flows into the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> through the penetration <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Because the volume of operating fluid in the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is increased, the hydraulic cylinder piston <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is pushed down. The amount by which it is pulled down is given by the quotient of the volume of operating fluid entering from the oil chamber <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for locking into the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, divided by the effective sectional area of the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> (for instance, about 3 mm). Therefore, the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that carries the blank is locked and prevented from moving above the bottom dead center point, and is then lowered by a predetermined dimension from the bottom dead center point (for example, about 3 mm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> (Process C) When the die rises from the bottom dead center point to the top dead center point, the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> detects the stroke signal from the pusher pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, sent from the cushion stroke sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and deenergizes the changeover valve <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting. The air pressure in the air chamber <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting in the pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting decreases, and the piston <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting moves to the side of the air chamber <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting. When the piston <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting has moved to the side of the air chamber <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting, operating fluid in the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> flows into the oil chamber for secondary lifting through the hydraulic cylinder penetration <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Since the volume of the operating fluid in the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> decreases, the hydraulic cylinder piston <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> rises. The stroke of the rise thereof is given by the quotient calculated by dividing the volume of the operating fluid entering into the oil chamber <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting from the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> by the effective cross section of the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> (for instance, about 35 mm). Consequently, the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that supports the blank is raised by a predetermined dimension (for example, about 35 mm) and then stops. The unloader receives the blank supported by the blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and sends it to a subsequent process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> (Process D) Before the die reaches the top dead center point, the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> inputs a signal detecting the movement of the pusher pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> sent from the cushion stroke sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and deenergizes the changeover valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> for locking. The air pressure in the air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking of the pneumo-hydraulic converter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for locking is reduced, and the piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking moves to the side of the air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking. In addition, the piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking opens the drain port <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> for locking that has been closed. When the piston <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for locking moves to the side of the air chamber <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for locking, the operating fluid in the upper oil chamber <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> passes through the hydraulic cylinder penetration <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> of the wall of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, flows into the oil chamber for locking, passes through the drain port <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> for locking and is discharged outside. The speed at which the operating fluid flows out of the drain port <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> for locking is adjusted to a predetermined speed by the flow regulator valve <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the hydraulic cylinder piston <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> rises at a predetermined speed, and raises the pusher pad to the initial standby position. The blank holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> remains stationary at an intermediate location between the top and bottom dead center points. The changeover valve <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> for secondary lifting is energized, and the cycle resumes from the initial status. This cycle is repeated subsequently, to press blanks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Using the die cushion apparatus according to the aforementioned embodiment, an ordinary operating fluid can be used, so there is no need to control the cleanliness of the fluid unlike conventional servo systems. Since a conventional 3-port solenoid changeover valve is used, the apparatus can work reliabry and quickly without any of the delays in control responses that are often seen in a conventional servo system, and the apparatus can easily be adjusted. Because the pneumo-hydraulic converter is used, oil can be input and output without delay, therefore the overall timing of the die cushion apparatus can be easily adjusted. In addition, the operating cylinder can be made compact as the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting is integrated into the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking. In addition, because an intensifier can be used for the pneumo-hydraulic converters, so-called utility air normally available at the works can be used, so no special air source must be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not restricted only to the above-mentioned embodiments, but the invention can be modified in various ways as long as the essentials of the invention are not exceeded. Although the foregoing description referred to the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking, being built into the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting, the invention is not restricted only to that construction; instead, the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting can be incorporated in the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking, or the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking can be structured separately from the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting. Albeit the operating gas cylinder was described as being operated by air as the gas, this is not a restriction, and any gas can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As explained above, the die cushion apparatus that can hold the periphery of a blank when it is being pressed by the die according to the present invention provides the following advantages by virtue of its configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Since the aforementioned rod and supporting member, integrated together, are pushed upwards by the gas pressure cylinder, the blank can be pushed upwards when the die is being lowered. In addition, when the die passes the bottom dead center point, the drain port is closed and oil in the oil chamber on the side of the above-mentioned rod of the hydraulic cylinder is trapped in place, thus the movement of the blank can be stopped. In addition, when the die moves from the bottom dead center point to the top dead center point, the blank can be raised by a predetermined distance as the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting moves the piston to the gas chamber side and operating fluid in the oil chamber on the side of the aforementioned rod of the hydraulic cylinder flows into the oil chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In addition, as the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking can transfer operating fluid from the oil chamber into the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder by moving the piston to the oil chamber side, the blank can be lowered by a predetermined distance by filling the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder with the operating fluid in the oil chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking when the die passes the bottom dead center point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Since oil can be drained from the oil chamber on the aforementioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder through the hole penetrating the cylinder wall of the oil chamber in the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking and the flow of oil can be stopped by moving the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking to the oil chamber side, the oil can be confined in the oil chamber on the aforementioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder by increasing the pressure in the gas chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking. In addition, because the piston of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking can open the aforementioned hole when the piston is moved to the gas chamber side, the oil can be drained from the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder by decreasing the pressure in the gas chamber of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Also, the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking and the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting can be integrated into one body, so these converters can be made compact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In addition, oil can be drained from the oil chamber on the above-mentioned rod side of the hydraulic cylinder through the hole penetrating the wall of the oil chamber in the pneumo-hydraulic converter for locking and the hole through the wall of the pneumo-hydraulic converter for secondary lifting, therefore the drain port can be incorporated into the integrated assembly of the pneumo-hydraulic converters for locking and secondary lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In addition, the pneumo-hydraulic converters for secondary lifting and locking can be consolidated into a single unit, so these converters can be made compact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Since the pneumo-hydraulic converters can be driven by a low-pressure gas, the die cushion apparatus can be driven by an easily procured gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In consequence, a die cushion apparatus that is low in cost and easy to handle and maintain can be offered. </paragraph>
