<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to mobile telecommunications and more specifically to the use of multimode mobile radio terminals able to communicate in any of two or more mobile radio modes. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Mobile radio modes known at present to the person skilled in the art include the second generation Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) mode, the third generation Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) mode, and the Personal Communication Service (PCS) mode in use in America, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a mobile radio terminal sets up calls via base stations using a radio access technology (RAT). Different radio access technologies can coexist, with base stations dedicated to a first mobile radio mode, for example GSM base transceiver stations (BTS), and stations dedicated to a second mobile radio mode, for example UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) antennas. Other radio access technologies may be introduced in the future, with other mobile radio modes, and become part of the problem addressed by the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Given this background, it would appear to be crucial that a mobile radio terminal be able to operate in accordance with any standard associated with any current mobile radio mode, i.e. with any of the radio access technologies associated with said modes. This interworking is essential for three main reasons: to maintain continuity of service during a call, to maintain continuity of service between calls, when the terminal is in standby mode, and to support measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To set up a call, a mobile terminal must be associated with a base station of the geographical area in which it is located, which may be dedicated to any of the radio access technologies currently in use in the territory concerned. The base station passes the call to a controller which passes it to a switching center which directs the call to the base station associated with the destination terminal or to another network associated with the destination terminal (Internet, public switched telecommunication/telephone network (PSTN), etc.). If the mobile terminal moves around while a call is in progress, handover is required to maintain continuity of service. The handover can be between base stations using the same or different radio access technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Between calls, a mobile terminal must remain in a standby state, in which it is also associated with a base station. If it is moving around, the mobile terminal can perform a reselection operation to connect to a base station in a new geographical area. Reselection is also required if the mobile terminal is communicating in a data packet mode, for example if it is using the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Finally, a multimode mobile radio terminal must be able to support regular measurement of signals received from a base station using a first mode (for example the GSM mode) even though it is connected by a radio link to a base station using a different mode (for example the UMTS mode). Such measurements are often imposed by the standardization bodies that regulate existing and projected mobile radio services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Interworking of a plurality of radio access technologies (for handover, reselection, measurements) is not necessarily guaranteed, in particular because each mobile radio mode has its own clock. Thus in the case of the GSM and UMTS modes, the periods of the radio frames for calls are not the same, being 4.615 ms for the GSM and 10 ms for the UMTS. This is not merely a question of lack of synchronization between base stations, but a real difference in the time frame of reference between the two standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A multimode mobile terminal connected by a radio link to a base station using a first mode must therefore be in a position to know the exact time for at least one other mode. It is therefore important for a multimode mobile terminal to be able to determine the time shift between two mobile radio modes in order to be able to switch from one to the other during a call, when in standby mode, or to carry out measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One solution is to continue to listen regularly to one mode while using another mode (for example, listening to GSM stations when communicating with UMTS stations). This kind of solution is not the optimum, however, because it is costly in terms of energy consumption and therefore in mobile terminal battery life. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is therefore to propose a method of determining the time shift between at least two mobile radio modes to enable a multimode mobile terminal to set up a call in accordance with the respective radio access technology associated with each mobile radio mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For example, an object of the invention is to enable a mobile terminal to determine the time in the GSM mode while it is operating in the UMTS mode, and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus the invention more specifically provides a method of switching from a first mobile radio mode to a second mobile radio mode in a multimode mobile radio terminal having a first part and a second part respectively operating in compliance with first and second radio access technologies respectively associated with the first and second mobile radio modes and respectively provided with first and second clocks, the method comprising the following steps: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> detecting the start of a radio frame of the radio access technology associated with the second mobile radio mode; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> storing the updated time indicated by the first clock associated with said first mobile radio mode and the time indicated by the second clock associated with said second mode, and stopping the counter; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> calculating the time shift from the stored times indicated by the first and second clocks and the value of the counter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to a feature, the supply of power to one part of the terminal operating in one mobile radio mode is interrupted and said method includes a step of activation of said one part by a second part operating in another mobile radio mode and a step of updating the time of said activated part of the terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a multimode mobile radio terminal including a microcontroller and having two parts adapted to communicate in compliance with respective radio access technologies associated with respective different mobile radio modes, the terminal including a counter adapted to count the time that has elapsed between the start of a radio frame of the first technology and the start of a radio frame of the second technology, means for calculating the time shift between said radio access technologies, and means for updating the time of a part of the terminal to the time of the technology associated with said part. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is clear that the time shift between the radio frames of two technologies associated with two different mobile radio modes is not a simple lack of synchronization, but stems from a time shift between their clocks. Thus the respective standards set a duration of 10 ms for radio frames R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> associated with the first technology (for example the UTRAN technology) and a duration of 4.615 ms for radio frames R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> associated with the second technology (for the example GSM technology). The objective of the invention is to enable correct switching from a frame R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a frame R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> respectively associated with any two different radio access technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes the start of a frame R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> associated with a first mode M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> the start of a frame R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> associated with a second mode M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; corresponds to the time in the first mode at the start of a frame R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the second mode and &Dgr;K expresses the shift between the start of the frames R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the respective modes, in other words: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Dgr;<highlight><italic>K&equals;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&prime;&minus;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&minus;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The times the respective radio access technologies associated with each mode are given by clocks U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprising counters fixing the duration of a radio frame and subdividing the frames in time using counters with a higher resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For example, if the first mobile radio mode M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is associated with the UTRAN technology, the corresponding clock U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a superframe number counter SFN and more accurate subframe counters, such as timeslot counters and chip counters. These are standard counters which have clocks with a shorter period than the frame counter and their use is generalized in the UTRAN technology. Similarly, if the second mobile radio mode M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is associated with the GSM technology, the corresponding clock U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also has the standard counters that are routinely used, such as frame counters T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and subframe counters known as timeslot counters and quarter bit counters. All these counters, which are well known to the person skilled in the art, define the precise time in each standardized mobile radio mode. The invention aims to determine the time shift between the timing frames of reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a more specific implementation of the invention. A counter &Dgr;K is triggered by the beginning of a frame R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a first mode M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and stopped by the start of a frame R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a second mode M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The counter &Dgr;K is a fast counter, i.e. it has a clock CLK whose period is shorter than those of the frame counters of the two radio access technologies concerned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention therefore comprises the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal is locked to a base station using a first radio access technology (for example a UTRAN station). At the start of a frame R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first technology, the time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is measured and the counter &Dgr;K is triggered by a signal from a START logical unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal monitors radio transmissions of the second radio access technology (for example GSM transmissions) and detects the start of a frame R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the second technology. The counter &Dgr;K is then stopped by a signal from the STOP logic unit and the time T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in the second technology and the updated time T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&prime; of the first clock U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The microcontroller of the mobile terminal then computes the time shift &Dgr;t between the two radio access technologies from the data &Dgr;K, T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&prime; and T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal modifies its clock and can execute measurements or set up a call in accordance with the second radio access technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The time T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is provided by the frame counter associated with the first technology (for example the counters SFN and &Dgr;K for the UMTS technology), the other, higher resolution counters (timeslot and chip counters) being set to zero. Similarly, the time T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is provided by the frame counter associated with the second technology (for example the counters T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for the GSM technology), the other, higher resolution counters (timeslot and quarter bit counters) being set to zero. On the other hand, the updated time T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&prime; is expressed with the aid of subframe counters to indicate a time interval within the period of the frame. The value of the counter &Dgr;K is expressed in time units of one of the radio access technologies, depending on the starting point of the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Implementing the method according to the invention in a mobile terminal necessitates the addition of a counter &Dgr;K and logic circuits constituting the START and STOP logic units controlling the counter. This does not give rise to any particular problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Thus the invention consists in calculating the time shift &Dgr;t between two modes associated with two different radio access technologies in the mobile terminal and at a given time. The shift &Dgr;t is not constant, but if the periods of the frames R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> associated with the radio access technologies and the shift &Dgr;t at a given time are known, a knowledge of the time shift between the two mobile radio modes can be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An advantageous application of the present invention is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A multimode mobile radio terminal has parts dedicated to calls in accordance with respective radio access technologies, each of which is associated with a particular mobile radio mode. To guarantee good interworking of the terminal with any radio access technology, as previously described, it is necessary for said terminal to maintain temporal synchronization with each of the radio access technologies that it might be called upon to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Thus, in accordance with the invention, a multimode mobile terminal associated with a base station associated with a first mobile radio mode can hold directly in its memory a precise indication of the time in another mobile radio mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In a multimode terminal, a microcontroller controls the various parts associated with each mode, for example a UMTS part and a GSM part. When the mobile is locked to a base station associated with a first mode (for example the UTRAN mode), the power supply to the part associated with the second mode (for example the GSM mode) can be interrupted, to save power. When a measurement on a station associated with the second mode is necessary, for example at intervals of about thirty seconds according to the UMTS standard, the party associated with the first mode can activate the second mode via the microcontroller and set the terminal to the time of said second mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The part associated with the first mode can maintain the time of the second mode by calculating the time shift &Dgr;t at a particular time, as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Determining the time shift &Dgr;t between the two mobile radio modes necessitates waiting for a first event, namely the start of a radio frame associated with the first mode, and waiting for a second event, namely the start of a radio frame associated with the second mode, i.e. waiting for 10&plus;4.615 ms in the present example. Factoring in the time necessary for executing the method according the invention, the time shift &Dgr;t is calculated in 20 to 25 ms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> This can have an advantageous practical application, namely interrupting the supply of power to a part of the terminal dedicated to a mode that is not being used, and activating it only when that mode is to be used for a measurement or a call. This is obviously beneficial in terms of power consumption and therefore of mobile terminal battery life. For example, if the GSM part were instead to remain in the standby mode, a measurement would be carried out every 2 ms, although this frequency of measurement is not necessary in the context of the standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The description and the drawings refer to the GSM and UTRAN radio access technologies. The present invention can nevertheless be applied to any radio access technologies with different clocks. </paragraph>
