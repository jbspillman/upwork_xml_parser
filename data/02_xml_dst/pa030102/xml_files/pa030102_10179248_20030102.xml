<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> It is known from GB-A-2323348 to provide an invalid hoist comprising a mobile chassis, a mast upstanding from the chassis, a lifting arm pivotably connected to the upper end of the mast, the lifting arm having a sling hanger or at least one sling attachment point at or adjacent to one end thereof, a power operated extendible/retractable actuator between the lifting arm and the lower part of the mast, the lifting arm being pivotably connected to the upper end of the mast at a position intermediate its ends and the actuator being connected to the lifting arm on the side of the pivotable connection between the lifting arm and the mast remote from said one end of the lifting arm, and a link pivotably connected between one end of the actuator and either the lifting arm or the mast so that if the lifting arm meets with an obstruction during a lowering operation, the actuator and link will pivot relative to one another so that the actuator can continue to extend without applying a force to the lifting arm to urge the latter against the obstruction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is often a requirement to be able to weigh a patient and it is convenient to do this while the patient is supported by an invalid hoist as this saves both time and effort. However, it is expensive to provide every hoist with a load cell, for example in the lifting arm or the mast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to overcome this problem. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an invalid hoist comprising a mobile chassis, a mast upstanding from the chassis, a lifting arm pivotably connected to the upper end of the mast, the lifting arm having a sling hanger or at least one sling attachment point at or adjacent to one end thereof, a power operated extendible/retractable actuator between the lifting arm and a lower part of the mast, the lifting arm being pivotably connected to the upper end of the mast at a position intermediate its ends and the actuator being connected to the lifting arm on the side of the pivotable connection between the lifting arm and the mast remote from said one end of the lifting arm, and a connecting link pivotably connected between one end of the actuator and the lifting arm (or the mast) so that if the lifting arm meets with an obstruction during a lowering operation, the actuator and link will pivot relative to one another so that the actuator can continue to extend without applying a force to the lifting arm to urge the latter against the obstruction, wherein the connecting link is connected between said one end of the actuator and the lifting arm (or the mast) such that an auxiliary link incorporating a load cell can be additionally and removably connected between said one end of the actuator and the lifting arm (or the mast) and such that any load then applied to the lifting arm is transmitted entirely through the auxiliary link and not through the connecting link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an invalid hoist as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in combination with an auxiliary link incorporating a load cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is thus possible to supply one or a small number of auxiliary links, each incorporating a load cell, for use with a much larger number of hoists. The auxiliary link may then be used only when needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention will now be more particularly described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the drawings, the invalid hoist shown therein has a mobile chassis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided with castors <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a fixed length mast <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> upstanding from the chassis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a lifting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> pivotably connected intermediate its ends to the upper end of the mast <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about a pivot shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A sling hanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is connected to one end of the lifting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a motor driven extendible/retractable actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected between the other end of the lifting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> secured to a lower end portion of the mast <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The sling hanger has a plurality of sling attachment points (not shown) for supporting a full body sling in known manner (see, for example, GB2184706). The actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is powered by a rechargeable battery <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The length of the lifting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between the sling hanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the mast <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is greater than the length of the lifting arm between the mast <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A connecting link <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected between the upper end of the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a lug <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> fixed to said other end of the lifting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. One end of the connecting link <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pivotably connected to the upper end of the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the other end of the connecting link <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pivotably connected to the lug <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. If the lifting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> meets with an obstruction during a patient lowering operation, the connecting link <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will pivot relative to one another, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, so that the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can continue to extend without applying a force to the lifting arm to urge the latter against the obstruction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pivotably connected to the bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by a pivot pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fixed relative to the bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and extends through an elongate slot <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> formed in the lower end of the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is thus connected to the bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for limited upwards and downwards movement determined by the length of the slot <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the diameter of the pivot pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A sensor, typically in the form of a microswitch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, senses when the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is in a lowermost position and de-energises the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The leverage applied by the lifting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (particularly when the sling hanger <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> supports a patient in a sling) will normally place the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> under tension and, in this condition, the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will adopt its uppermost position relative to the bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. However, if the lifting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> meets with an obstruction during a patient lowering operation, the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will move to its lowermost position relative to the bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will trip the microswitch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and de-energise the actuator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A handle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is connected to an upper part of a mast so that a helper can move the hoist along the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the connecting link <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises two arms <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> each of which is permanently connected to the lifting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by respective pins <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Each arm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has an elongate slot <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> at or adjacent to each of its opposite ends. The slots <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are dimensioned to receive respective pins <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as a sliding fit. The ends of the pins <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are typically stepped. This enables the arms <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to be held in parallel spaced relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The ends of the slots <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> closest to the ends of the arms <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are spaced a distance &lsquo;X&rsquo; (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) from each other, for a reason which will become apparent hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An auxiliary link <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. The auxiliary link <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> comprises a body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which includes a load cell <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and which has hook-shaped formations <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> at each end of the body <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The auxiliary link <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may also be provided with a dedicated display (not shown) for displaying a load sensed by the load cell <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The two hook-shaped formations <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be contra-orientated as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to aid centralisation of a transmitted load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, each hook-shaped formation <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> comprises two hook-shaped elements <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are laterally spaced apart to accommodate the lug <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> on the lifting arm and a similar lug at the upper end of the actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The troughs <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the hook-shaped elements <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are spaced a distance &lsquo;Y&rsquo; from each other (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). This distance &lsquo;Y&rsquo; is less than the distance &lsquo;X&rsquo; between the ends of the slots <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As such, since the effective length of the auxiliary link <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is less than the maximum effective length of the connecting link <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, when the auxiliary link <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is hooked over the two pins <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, respectively, the load applied by the lifting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and any patient supported therefrom, will be transmitted entirely through the auxiliary link <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and not through the connecting link <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The load detected by the load cell <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> will then be representative of the weight of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With such an arrangement, it is possible to supply a single auxiliary link <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, incorporating a load cell <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, for use with a plurality of invalid hoists. The auxiliary link <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can be used as and when required. The arrangement is failsafe in that if a nurse or carer fails to install the auxiliary link properly, the load will be taken by the arms <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and this will avoid the occurrence of accidents which could happen if the links <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> were to be interchangeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The invalid hoist described above is designed to lift a patient in a full body support sling. It could, however, be modified to serve as a standing aid for raising a patient from a seated to a standing position. In this case, the said one end of the lifting arm can be forked to provide two laterally spaced sling attachment points for attaching a sling which passes around the back of a patient and below the patient&apos;s armpits. In this case, the chassis may be provided with a footrest and a knee abutment may be provided on the mast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The embodiment described above is given by way of example only and various modifications will be apparent to persons skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For example, the motor driven actuator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> could be replaced by a fluid pressure operated actuator. The arms <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the connecting link <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> could each have an elongate slot at one end only. Also, instead of being rigid, the connecting link <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> could be flexible. </paragraph>
