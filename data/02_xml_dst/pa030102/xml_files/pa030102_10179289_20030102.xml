<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a focal-plane shutter for a digital camera wherein to photograph, two blades consisting of a first blade and a second blade are operated in order in the same direction and the light reception face of an image pickup device is exposed to light through a slit formed by the first and second blades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, with a focal-plane shutter adopted for a conventional camera using a silver-salt film, first blades electromagnet and second blades electromagnet are previously energized before the light exposure operation of a first blade and a second blade. Then, the electromagnets is shut off in order at a predetermined timing by an output signal of a light exposure time control circuit, and a first blades drive member and a second blades drive member are rotated by the urging forces of a first blade drive spring and a second blade drive spring, thereby causing the first blade and the second blade to perform the light exposure operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Two types of configuration for holding the first blades drive member and the second blades drive member at the set position to the next photographing are known, usually called direct type and retention type. In the direct type, at the set position, the first blades drive member and the second blades drive member are brought into contact with the first blade electromagnet and the second blade electromagnet respectively, and when a release button of the camera is pressed at the next photographing, the electromagnets are energized and at the stage at which the drive members are reliably attracted by the magnetic forces of the electromagnets, a set member is restored to the initial position before the set operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the retention type, the first blades drive member and the second blades drive member are retained at the set position by retention members and when a release button of the camera is pressed at the next photographing, the retention is released by the electromagnets. Therefore, in the retention type, a set member may be restored to the initial position immediately after completion of setting the drive members, or may be restored to the initial position before photographing in association with release as with the direct type described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> By the way, a digital camera for photographing a subject by an image pickup device of a CCD, etc., for converting photograph light formed by a photographing lens into electric data adopts a focal-plane shutter of a similar type to the type described above, in which a first blade and a second blade are operated in order at a predetermined timing and continuous light exposure is conducted from one side of a light reception face of the image pickup device to an opposite side through a slit formed by the first and second blades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Some of the digital cameras using a shutter of such a configuration are of the type in which an optical finder is provided as with the conventional camera and the light reception face is covered with at least either of the first and second blades except that photographing is conducted, and of the type in which a subject can be displayed by an electronic viewfinder implemented as a liquid crystal display, etc., for making it possible to view image data output from the image pickup device with the image pickup device exposed to photograph light even when photographing is not conducted. Therefore, in the latter type, to photograph, the first blade is operated to the position covering the light reception face before light exposure operation is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a related art as disclosed in JP-A-62-128675. The related art discloses a shutter of the direct type described above. When the camera power is turned on, as a motor lever <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (operation member) is turned clockwise, a set lever <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> (set member) is turned counterclockwise from the initial position. Thus, an open blade drive lever <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (first blades drive member) and a closed blade drive lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (second blades drive member) are turned clockwise against the urging forces of a spring <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> (first blade drive spring) and a spring <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (second blade drive spring) and the set completion state is entered. At this time, only the closed blade drive lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is attracted to an electromagnet on the closed vane side (second blade electromagnet). After this, as the set lever <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is restored to the initial position, the open blade drive lever <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is operated to the open position, but the closed blade drive lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is already attracted to the electromagnet and thus an aperture (opening) is opened by an open vane (first blades) and a closed vane (second blades) and it is made possible to display a subject through an electronic viewfinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When release operation is performed, the electromagnet on the closed vane side is demagnetized and thus the closed blade drive lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is turned counterclockwise by the tension of the spring <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for moving the closed vane to the position closing the aperture. After this, in a state in which both an electromagnet on the open vane side (first blade electromagnet) and the electromagnet on the closed vane side are excited as the set lever <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is turned counterclockwise, the open blade drive lever <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the closed blade drive lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are operated to the set completion position and are attracted to their respective electromagnets. After the open blade drive lever <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the closed blade drive lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are thus attracted and held, when the set lever <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is restored to the initial position by the urging force of a spring <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the electromagnet on the open vane side and the electromagnet on the closed vane side are demagnetized in order, whereby the blades start the light exposure operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In such a control method, when the camera is not used, the shutter blade is closed to protect the image pickup device from direct sunlight and as the power is turned on, the aperture is opened; this point is desirable. On the other hand, however, from the time when the power is turned on, the closed blade drive lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> must be kept at the open position to display a subject on the electronic viewfinder and thus an electric current must be continuously supplied to the closed vane electromagnet and power consumption is noticeable; this is an extreme problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> If the open position is kept by the attraction force of the closed vane electromagnet, when vibration or a shock is applied to the camera, it is transmitted to the shutter, whereby the closed blade drive lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is not kept at the open position and is brought away from the open position and a malfunction of closing the aperture may occur. Thus, a countermeasure of increasing the electric current applied to the electromagnet for enlarging the attraction force is taken; however, also in this case, a power consumption problem occurs. Particularly, with the digital camera, the camera size is made small as compared with that of the conventional camera and thus the power supply volume is limited and photoelectric conversion of the image pickup device, display on the electronic viewfinder, image recording, and the like also consume power and thus there is strong demand to suppress power consumption as much as possible. Further, to suppress costs, the focal-plane shutter of the conventional camera may be used as that of the digital camera. In such a case, however, it is large demand to suppress change in the shutter configuration and change in the parts accompanying the change in the shutter configuration as much as possible for reducing costs together with suppression of power consumption described above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to provide a focal-plane shutter for a digital camera for exposing the light reception face of an image pickup device to light through a slit formed by first and second blades, the focal-plane shutter being suited for a camera comprising an electronic view finder and appropriate for lower power consumption and cost reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To the end, according to the invention, there is provided a focal-plane shutter for a digital camera, comprising a shutter base plate having an aperture for light exposure; a set member being capable of reciprocating on the shutter base plate, when the set member is moved by an operation member on the camera side and is operated from an initial position to a set position, the set member for operating a first blades drive member for driving a first blade and a second blades drive member for driving a second blade to the set position against urging forces of drive springs and before light exposure operation of each drive member starts, the set member being restored to the initial position in association with the operation member; and a first blade holding member and a second blade holding member for holding each drive member at a light exposure operation start position just before the light exposure operation starts and when the light exposure operation starts, releasing holding each drive member at a predetermined timing, wherein when the set member is operated from the initial position to the set position, at the initial stage, the set member operates at least the second blades drive member against the urging force of the drive spring and once stops at a midway position at which the second blade opens the aperture in association with motion of the operation member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the focal-plane shutter of the invention, if the slit formation margin of the first blade is made to enter the aperture to a position not covering the light reception face of an image pickup device placed on a photograph optical path passing through the aperture by the time the set member reaches the midway position from the initial position, the operation amount of the first blade from release to the set position is lessened, so that it is made possible to shorten the time required for the set operation. If the first blade holding member and the second blade holding member are each an electromagnet for attracting an iron piece member placed on each drive member, the configuration of the shutter is simplified.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of applying the invention to a shutter of direct type will be discussed with reference to the accompanying drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a plan view of viewing a shutter from the subject side, namely, the photograph lens side with the shutter built in a camera and shows a state in which the main power of the camera is oft or a state just after termination of light exposure operation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a plan view of the left half of the view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and shows the state of a midway position with a second blade group set and an aperture opened from the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a plan view similar to that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and shows a state in which both a first blade group and the second blade group are set from the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a plan view similar to that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and shows a state in which a set member is restored to the initial position from the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, namely, a state just before start of light exposure operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The embodiment is configured as a focal-plane shutter of direct type and first and second blades use each a plurality of blades as with most of focal-plane shutters for silver-salt cameras. Thus, the blades will be referred to as first blade group and second blade group. To begin with, the configuration of the embodiment will be discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the subject side will be referred to as the surface and the opposite side will be referred to as the rear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> shutter base plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed roughly at the center with a rectangular aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for light exposure. Although not shown, as known, an intermediate plate and an auxiliary base plate are attached in order with a predetermined spacing to the rear of the shutter base plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A vane chamber for the first blade group is formed between the shutter base plate land the intermediate plate. A vane chamber for the second blade group is formed between the intermediate plate and the auxiliary base plate. The intermediate plate and the auxiliary base plate are also formed each with an aperture similar to the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and usually the three apertures are put on each other for forming a light exposure aperture; in the embodiment, the shape of the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>regulates the light exposure aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The shutter base plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached to the camera main unit by screws <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an image pickup unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is attached to the camera main unit by an appropriate method on the rear of the auxiliary base plate.

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Next, the configurations of the first blade group and the second blade group attached to the rear of the shutter base plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be discussed. To begin with, first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is placed between the shutter base plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the intermediate plate and is made up of two arms <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> rotatably attached to the shafts <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>of the shutter base plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and four blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>pivotally supported in order in the length direction of the arms. The vane <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>pivotally supported at the extremity is a slit formation vane and the upper end margin of the vane <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is a slit formation margin. An arcuate slot is made in one arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the first blade group and the drive pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fitted into the arcuate slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has the same configuration as the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is placed between the intermediate plate and the auxiliary base plate in a state in which the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is turned upside down. The second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is made up of two arms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> rotatably attached to the shafts <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>of the shutter base plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and four blades <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>pivotally supported in order in the length direction of the arms. The vane <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>pivotally supported at the extremity is a slit formation vane and the lower end margin of the vane <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is a slit formation margin. The drive pin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fitted into an arcuate slot made in the arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the embodiment will be discussed with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is common to the main power off state with the camera unused and the state just after termination of light exposure operation. At the initial stage, in the description, it is assumed that the main power on the camera side is off. Since the focal-plane shutter of the embodiment is used with a digital camera adopting an electronic viewfinder to display a subject, when the main power is on, the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>needs to be opened even when photographing is not conducted. However, if the main power is turned off in such an open state, the operation may stop with the aperture la remaining open; in the embodiment, when the main power is off, as the operation member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> retreats, the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is restored to the initial position by a spring (not shown) for releasing pressing each drive member. Thus, the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is covered with the four blades <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for making it possible to suppress performance degradation of the image pickup device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> caused by direct sunlight incident through the photograph lens. In the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the blades of the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are superposed on each other and are stored at a position below the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, fully opening the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the blades of the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are placed in a development state, closing the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. If the main power on the camera side is turned on from this state, the set operation is started and the operation member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> presses the pressed part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for clockwise rotating the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> against the urging force of spring (not shown) Accordingly, the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> presses the pressed part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for counterclockwise rotating the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> against the urging force of the second blade drive spring (not shown). Thus, the arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated counterclockwise by the drive pin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and while the mutual overlap amount is increased, the blades of the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are superposed on each other upward, opening the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> starts to press the pressed part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after a delay since the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> started to press the pressed part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the pressed part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotated counterclockwise against the urging force of the first blade drive spring (not shown), and while the mutual overlap amount is lessened, the blades of the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are developed upward. However, the operation is once stopped before the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is completely closed. Thus, the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is opened by both the vane groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the state in which the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is opened at the initial stage of the set operation. When this state is entered, the operation member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> once stops and rotation of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is stopped accordingly. The stop position of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a midway position of the set operation and the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> presses the pressed part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for causing the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to retreat from the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> a little presses the pressed part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for causing the slit formation margin of the vane <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to face the inside of the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, but stops at the position not covering the light reception face of the image pickup device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Thus, the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is in an open state although it is not fully open and in such a state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is made possible to display a subject on the electronic viewfinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Just before the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is entered, the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> brings the iron piece member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> into contact with the iron core <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the second blade electromagnet and in the state, brings the pressed part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into contact with the peripheral surface of the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The contact relationship of the iron piece member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the iron core <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is kept good by the attachment structure of the iron member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> via the spring (not shown) as described above. Therefore, in the embodiment, as the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> stops at the midway position, the open state of the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is maintained, so that the need for energizing the second blade electromagnet as disclosed in JP-A-62-128675 described above is eliminated and it is made possible to suppress power consumption. If vibration or a shock is applied in this state, the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be held reliably, so that power consumption can also be suppressed in preventing a malfunction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Next, to photograph, if a release button of the camera is pressed in the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the operation member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> furthermore presses the pressed part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for rotating the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> furthermore clockwise from the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> against the urging force of the spring (not shown). Consequently, the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> presses the pressed part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so that the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotated furthermore counterclockwise against the urging force of the first blade drive spring (not shown) and the drive pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>rotates the arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> counterclockwise. Thus, the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are operated upward while they are developed, and the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is closed by the slit formation margin of the vane <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the peripheral surface of the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comes only in sliding contact with the peripheral surface of the pressed part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and does not rotate the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and thus the blades <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> remain stored in a position above the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Then, when the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is completely closed by the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the operation member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>,stops pressing the pressed part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and at the same time, rotation of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is also stopped. As for the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the stop position is the set position and the state at this time is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> At this time, at the midway position, the slit formation margin of the vane <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is previously made to face the inside of the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, so that the operation time until the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> closes the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>completely is shortened and the set operation of the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is performed rapidly. Just before the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is entered, the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> brings the iron piece member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into contact with the iron core <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the first blade electromagnet and in the state, brings the pressed part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into contact with the peripheral surface of the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the contact relationship of the iron piece member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the iron core <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is kept good by the attachment structure of the iron member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the spring (not shown) as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, after the release switch is pressed as mentioned above, the first blade electromagnet and the second blade electromagnet are energized by a completion signal of light measurement or distance measurement and the iron cores <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> attract and hold the iron piece members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> placed in the contact state and at the same time, the operation of the light exposure time control circuit is also started. Further, as the operation member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> retreats upward, the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is counterclockwise rotated by the urging force of spring (not shown) from the set position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and is restored to the initial position without midway stopping. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the state just before start of light exposure operation. In the process in which the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is thus restored to the initial position, first the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>retreats from the pressed part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and next the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>retreats from the pressed part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Since the iron piece members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are already attracted to and held on the iron cores <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the drive members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are maintained in the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This state is the light exposure operation start position for the drive members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the vane groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> After the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is thus restored to the initial position, the light exposure operation is started by the light exposure time control circuit. To begin with, energizing the first blade electromagnet is shut off, counting the light exposure time is started, and the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is caused to perform the light exposure operation. Thus, the attraction force of the iron piece member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the iron core <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is lost and the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotated clockwise by the urging force of the first blade drive spring (not shown). Accordingly, the drive pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates the arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> clockwise from the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, so that the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are operated downward from the state closing the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and opens the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the slit formation margin of the upper margin of the slit formation vane <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>while the mutual overlap amount with the adjacent blades is increased. After the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are placed in a superpose state and fully open the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the drive pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>abuts the buffer member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and stops. The light exposure operation of the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is now complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> After the expiration of a predetermined time since energizing the first blade electromagnet was shut off, energizing the second blade electromagnet is shut off by a signal from the light exposure time control circuit, whereby the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is caused to perform light exposure operation. Thus, the attraction force of the iron piece member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by the iron core <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is lost and the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotated clockwise by the urging force of the second blade drive spring (not shown). Accordingly, the drive pin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rotates the arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> clockwise, so that the blades <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are operated downward from the state opening the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and closes the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the slit formation margin of the lower margin of the slit formation vane <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>while the mutual overlap amount with the adjacent blades is lessened. When the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is placed in the development state and closes the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>completely, the drive pin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>abuts the buffer member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and stops. The light exposure operation of the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is now complete. Thus, the light reception face of the image pickup device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is continuously exposed to light through the slit formed by each slit formation vane <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the state just after termination of the light exposure operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When such light exposure operation is complete and image information of the subject is transferred to a record apparatus, the operation member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is again moved downward by a transfer termination signal. That is, the same operation as the main power on the camera side is turned on is performed. Consequently, the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is stopped at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and again it is made possible to display a subject on the electronic viewfinder. Therefore, if the next photographing .is conducted, the light exposure operation is performed as described so far. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> However, if another photographing is not performed and the electronic viewfinder is not used either, the main power is turned off to avoid power consumption. Thus, as the operation member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> retreats upward, the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is rotated counterclockwise from the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and is restored to the initial state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Thus, as the pressed part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is released from the pressed state by the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the second blades drive member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotated clockwise by the urging force of the second blade drive spring (not shown) . Therefore, the blades <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the second blade group <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are also operated by the drive pin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, close the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and are restored to the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As for the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, likewise, as the pressed part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is released from the pressed state by the press part <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the set member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the first blades drive member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotated clockwise and thus the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the first blade group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> open the aperture <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>fully and are restored to the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The embodiment is configured as the shutter of direct type, but the invention is not limited to the shutter of direct type and can also be applied to the shutter of retention type as mentioned above. In the embodiment, each of the first blade group and the second blade group comprises four blades, but the invention does not limit the number of blades and the number of first blades and the number of second blades may be each one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, the slit formation margin of the first blade group enters the aperture to the position not covering the light reception face of the image pickup device by the time the set member reaches the midway position. However, the shapes of each press part of the set member and the pressed part of each drive member may be changed appropriately in response to upsizing of the image pickup device and the placement relationship of the image pickup device with the aperture, whereby their relative relationships may be changed and only the second blades drive member may be operated at the initial stage of the set operation. Further, in the embodiment, at the set operation time, first the second blades drive member is operated and then the first blades drive member is operated with a delay. However, the drive members can also be operated at the same time by changing the relative relationship in a similar manner to that described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As described above, the focal-plane shutter of the invention is excellent in that power consumption can be suppressed by eliminating the need for energizing the second blade electromagnet in the subject display state, although the focal-plane shutter is a focal-plane shutter for a digital camera comprising an electronic viewfinder. Since the state can be held mechanically by the set member, power consumption can also be suppressed in preventing a malfunction caused by vibration or a shock applied to the shutter. Further, a focal-plane shutter applied to conventional cameras can also be applied to a digital camera simply by replacing the set member of the focal-plane shutter, so that it is not necessary to largely change or complicate the configuration of the shutter; the focal-plane shutter of the invention is extremely advantageous for shutter manufacturing and cost reduction. </paragraph>
