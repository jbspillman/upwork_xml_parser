<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device-socket used for testing a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices mounted on an electronic equipment or others are subjected to various tests at a stage prior to being actually mounted so that latent defects therein are removed. The test is performed nondestructively through application of voltage stress, high-temperature operation, and high-temperature storage corresponding to thermal and mechanical environment tests or the like. Among these tests, there is a burn-in test effective for removing initial-inoperable integrated circuits, in which an operation test is performed under a high temperature condition for a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor device-socket subjected to such a test as disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3059946 and as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, for example, is disposed on a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that includes an input/output portion, to which portion a predetermined test voltage is supplied and which portion outputs an abnormality-detection signal representing a short-circuit or others is returned from the semiconductor device as an object to be tested and the abnormality detection signal is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor device-socket comprises a positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including a accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which a BGA-type (Ball Grid Array) semiconductor device is loaded as the semiconductor device for example; a contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for supporting the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arranged in a socket body movably as described later in a reciprocating fashion in a predetermined direction and bringing one of contact portion of a contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>described later into close proximity to the other of contact or keeping the one away from the other; a socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for accommodating the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> relatively movably with respect to a pair of the contact portion of the contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai</italic></highlight>; and a frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for transmitting operation force acting on itself to the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through a driving mechanism of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> At a predetermined position on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed a group of electrodes connected electrically to the input/output portion through a conductor layer. To the electrode group is connected a terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B on a proximal end side of a plurality of the contact terminals (i&equals;1 to n, n is a positive integer.) provided on the socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> disposed on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai</italic></highlight>, which is provided corresponding to each electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a mounted semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, comprises a terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B on the side of the proximal end and a pair of movable contact portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that are coupled with the just-mentioned terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B for selectively supporting each electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The pair of the movable contact portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> approach each other in response to the movement of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to pinch each electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or are separated from each other to release each electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is disposed movably along the movement direction of the movable contact portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>in the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is coupled to a driving mechanism composed of a pin and a lever as disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3059946. One end of the lever of the driving mechanism makes contact with an end of the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A partition wall portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>P is provided as a movable contact pressing portion inside of each opening portion where the movable contact portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>in the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are protruded, which portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>P is formed so as to divide portion between the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai</italic></highlight>. Further, between the one end of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and an inner peripheral portion of the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided a coiled spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as an urging member for urging the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> oppositely to a direction indicated by an arrow Mo in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to return the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to an initial position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, when the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved against the urging force of the coiled spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by the arrow Mo in response to the lowering operation of the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the partition wall portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>P is moved so as to separate the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>from the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In contrast, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved owing to the urging force of the coiled spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the restoring force of the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> oppositely to the direction indicated by the arrow Mo in response to rising operation of the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In such a structure, when the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is accommodated in the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as indicated by a chain double-dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is first moved downward. Accordingly, the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved against the urging force of the coiled spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As shown further in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, when the partition wall portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>P is moved and held such that the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>is kept away from the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is positioned between the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>and the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the same by placing the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is raised as indicated by a solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved to an initial position with the aid of the urging force of the coiled spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the restoring force of the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that the partition wall portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>P is separated from the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and brought into contact with the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, each electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is pinched with the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>and the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the same to permit each electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be electrically connected with each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved with the aid of the urging force of the coiled spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the restoring force of the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as described above, whereby three partition wall portions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>p </italic></highlight>are separated from the movable portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively and make contact with the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for movement to the initial position for example, whereby there happens a situation where some of the movable contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are separated from the electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. There is therefore a possibility that contact pressure between the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>and the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the same is deteriorated and electrical connection is incomplete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated as the cause of the foregoing possibility that a variation in the distance between some of the electrode portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> results from the positional deviation from a reference position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> There might be also contemplated in this situation that position accuracy of the electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is improved, but it is inadvisable to do so because of a certain limitation. </paragraph>

It is herein noticed that a predetermined gap may be formed between the lower end of the frame member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the end of the lever member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Between the lower end of the frame member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the socket body <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is provided a return spring (not shown) for urging the frame member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> upward. Provided that the frame member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is raised with the aid of the urging force of the coiled spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the need of such a return spring may be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The moving mechanism of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises a structure in a specification applied already by the present applicant as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 6-30280 (1994) for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In such a structure, in the case where upon the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> being loaded on the semiconductor device-socket, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> held by a robot hand (not shown) is accommodated in the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as indicated by a chain double-dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for example, the frame member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is first moved downward to a position indicated by the chain double-dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved against the urging force of the coiled spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with the aid of the movement mechanism of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved against the urging force of the coiled spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by an arrow O, the partition wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>W presses the movable contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> against its resilient force and separates the movable contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the movable contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as indicated by the chain double-dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Then, in the case where the movable contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>is separated from the movable contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is held, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is placed on the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, whereby the electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned between the movable contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and movable contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>through the opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When the frame member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is moved upward and is interrupted at a position indicated by a solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved in the direction indicated by the arrow C with the aid of the urging force of the coiled spring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the restoring force of the movable contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and then the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is interrupted by allowing the protrusion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>P to be engaged with the internal periphery <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the predetermined gap CL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed between the partition wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>W and the movable contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the predetermined gap CL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed between the external peripheral surface of the partition wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>W and the movable contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> too, so that it is eliminated that the partition wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>W causes none of the movable contacts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to make contact with the electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Upon removing the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the socket the frame member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is moved downnward again up to the position indicated by the chain double-dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as described above, and is then held, and the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is held and removed with a robot hand (not shown). </paragraph>
