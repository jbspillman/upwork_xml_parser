<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system interconnection electric power generator for enabling regeneration (supply) of electric power generated therein to a commercial power supply system which is interconnected to the electric power generator, and a method of controlling the system interconnection electric power generator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, there has been recently becoming widespread a solar energy generator (photovoltaic generator) as a system interconnection electric power generator in which not only electric power generated by utilizing sunlight as an energy source is supplied for personal use, but also extra electric power thus generated (which has not been used for personal use) is regenerated (supplied) to a commercial power supply system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In such a solar energy generator, DC power generated by using a solar battery is boosted by a boosting circuit and then the DC power thus boosted is converted to AC power corresponding to the AC power of a commercial power supply system by using an inverter circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In such a solar energy generator as described above, the DC power generated by the solar battery is used as a power supply source for various kinds of equipment constituting the solar energy generator, such as a boosting circuit, an inverter circuit, a controller for controlling the boosting circuit and the inverter circuit, various types of detecting sensors, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the solar energy generator thus constructed, in order to enhance the safety of the solar energy generator thus constructed, a current sensor for detecting the earth fault of DC power supplied to various kinds of equipment is equipped to DC lines at the solar battery side. A current converter or the like is generally used as the current sensor, and it contains a magnetic member around which a coil is wound. The magnetic member of the current sensor is generally formed of expensive super-saturated reactor or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In such a solar energy generator as described above, since electric power is generated by using sunlight, the amount of electric power to be generated by using a solar battery is reduced under such an atmosphere that the amount of insolation is low. For example, this is liable to occur at sunset or the like. Particularly in such a case that the electric power generated by the solar battery is partially supplied as a power supply source to various kinds of equipment constituting the solar energy generator, that is, a part of the electric power generated by the solar battery is consumed at these kinds of constituent equipment, the level of electric power to be supplied (regenerated) from the solar energy generator to the commercial power supply system is lower than a specified level required for the commercial power supply system at sunset or the like. Consequently, the supply of the electric power from the solar energy generator to the commercial power supply system must be stopped, that is, the operation of the solar energy generator itself must be stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the controller of the solar energy generator judges at all times whether the amount of electric power generated by the solar energy generator is lowered to the extent that it is impossible to use the electric power thus generated for the commercial power supply system at sunset or the like, that is, whether the electric power generated in the solar energy generator is lower than the specified power level or not, and stops the operation of the solar energy generator on the basis of the above judgment. In such a case that the amount of electric power generated in the solar energy generator is lower than the specified level, the electric power to be supplied from the solar energy generator to the various kinds of equipment (containing the controller) constituting the solar energy generator is also reduced, and thus the operation of these constituent equipment is unstable. Particularly when the electric power to be supplied to the controller (control power supply source) is lower, the controller cannot surely perform the judgment as to the reduction of the electric power (i.e., sunset or the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in such a solar energy generator as described above, the operational status of the solar energy generator under operation is merely displayed on a display panel or the like at that time point. Accordingly, in such a case that for example when some abnormality occurs in the commercial power supply system, the solar energy generator carries out a protecting operation of stopping supply of electric power therefrom to the commercial power supply under abnormality in order to protect the commercial power supply from being damaged or the like by further supply of the electric power to the commercial power supply, the data on the protecting operation of the solar energy generator are merely displayed on the display panel or the like at the time point when the abnormality occurs. That is, the data of the protecting operation which has been carried out until the abnormality is fixed do not remain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, after such a protecting operation is finished, even the fact that the protecting operation is carried out is not left. In this case, a service man(woman), a maintenance man(woman) or the like must take a countermeasure to the lack of the electric power to be supplied from the solar energy generator to the commercial power supply system while paying his/her attention to only the integration value of the amount of electric power generated by the solar energy generator. Therefore, it is substantially impossible to take a proper countermeasure to the lack of the electric power to be supplied from the solar energy generator to the commercial power supply system. That is, it has been hitherto impossible to determine the accurate cause for the lack of the electric power to be supplied from the solar energy generator to the commercial power supply system, and take the proper countermeasure thereto. </paragraph>

Therefore, for example after the operation of the solar energy generator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is finished, all the past operational status record can be surely judged on the basis of the operational status data stored in the external storage device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. As a result, the maintenance of the solar energy generator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the trouble shooting can be more properly performed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the DC earth fault detecting device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is constructed by the current sensor <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, an exciting amplifier <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, a voltage doubling and rectifying circuit <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and the microcomputer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, and it detects the DC earth fault at the side of the solar battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of this embodiment carries out the same control operation as the microcomputer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and particularly it is additionally designed to detect the earth fault of the direct current generated by the solar battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the current sensor <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, a detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> through which the two DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> penetrate comprises ZCT (Zero Current Transformer), which is generally equipped to a general AC earth leakage breaker. ZCT has a magnetic member around which a coil is wound, and the magnetic member is formed of an inexpensive material such as permalloy or the like. Therefore, it is unnecessary to use expensive material for the current sensor, so that the manufacturing cost of the solar energy generator can be reduce. The detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> formed of ZCT as described above is mounted in a case <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> of the solar battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The microcomputer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> contains an oscillator <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. When the microcomputer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> outputs a pulse-waveform voltage of &plusmn;2.5V from a PWM port <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> (PWM: Pulse Width Modulation) to the exciting amplifier <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> on the basis of a signal from the oscillator <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, the exciting amplifier <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> sets the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the current sensor to an excited state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Under the excited state, the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> measures the difference between the current values flowing through the two DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, and outputs the output current (AC) corresponding to the difference thus measured to the voltage doubling and rectifying circuit <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. That is, when no earth fault occurs in the DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, there occurs no difference between the current values of the two DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, and thus the output current from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is equal to zero because the positive and negative current values caused by the respective DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> are symmetrical with each other, that is, they are offset to each other. On the other hand, when earth fault occurs in the DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, the difference corresponding to the degree of the earth fault occurs between the DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, and thus the output current from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is shifted to the positive or negative side, so that positive/negative asymmetrical current is output from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The positive or negative current is output from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to the voltage doubling and rectifying circuit <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, and the voltage doubling and rectifying circuit <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> rectifies the output current (alternating current) output from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the current sensor <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> to direct current. The voltage doubling and rectifying circuit <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> transforms the voltage output from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to a voltage having amplitude which is double or more times as high as the voltage output from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, and then output the voltage to the A/D port <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> (A/D: Analogue to Digital) of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the voltage value input to the A/D port <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> detects whether earth fault occurs in the DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the relationship between the input voltage V input to the A/D port <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and the absolute value of the output current I from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> when various kinds of ZCTs (ZCT<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, ZCT<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, ZCT<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is assumed that earth fault occurs when the absolute value of the output current I from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is equal to I<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>(for example, 100 mA) or more. When an input voltage that is not less than the voltage corresponding to I<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>(i.e., V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) is input to the A/D port <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> judges that earth fault occurs in the DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, and detects the DC earth fault. The voltages V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are threshold voltages for the judgment on occurrence of DC earth fault when each of ZCT<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, ZCT<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, ZCT<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is used, and these voltages are measured in advance and stored in the external storage device in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> When the operation of the solar energy generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is stopped, no current flows from the solar battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, and thus the output current from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the current sensor <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is equal to zero. When the output current from the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is not equal to zero and thus a voltage is applied to the A/D port <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> although the operation of the solar energy generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is stopped, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> judges that some trouble occurs in the current sensor <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, and outputs an alarm or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the detecting core <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the current sensor <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> for measuring the difference between the currents flowing through the DC lines <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> connected to the solar battery <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is constructed by inexpensive ZCT (Zero Current Transformer) equipped to a general AC leakage breaker. Therefore, the current sensor <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> can be manufactured at low cost, and high safety can be kept in the solar energy generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by the DC earth-fault detection using the current sensor <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

However, the present invention may be applied to another system interconnection electric power generator in which electric power is regenerated (supplied) to the commercial power supply system by using another electric generating means such as a window power generator or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiments, the DC earth fault detecting device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is applied to the solar energy generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, however it may be applied particularly to a fuel battery for generating high voltage or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Further, the storage of the operational status data of the solar energy generator into the external storage device by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is carried out, not only just before the operation of the solar energy generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is finished (for example, at sunset), but also when an operational status to be stored occurs under the operation of the solar energy generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the system interconnection electric power generator of the present invention and the control method therefor, the power to be supplied to the various kinds of the system interconnection electric power generator can be excellently secured at all times until the operation of the system interconnection electric power generator is finished. Particularly, the control power to be supplied to the controller (microcomputer) can be excellently secured, so that the judgment processing of the controller as to sunset or the like can be surely performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the system interconnection electric power generator of the present invention and the control method therefor, the present and past operational status records of the system interconnection electric power generator can be surely recognized, and thus the maintenance and the trouble shooting of the solar energy generator can be properly performed by using these records. </paragraph>
