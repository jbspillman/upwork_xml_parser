<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a network game progress control system, a network game progress control method, a network game progress control program which control the progress of a network game which users play in a game space, and a recording medium which stores such a game progress control program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, as use of the Internet has become widespread and data transfer rates have increased, network games have generally been played using terminal devices used by users and a network game server device, which are connected via the Internet. As such network games, a variety of competitive games such as sports and fighting games are played. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When these competitive games are played, because the Internet is used, unspecified multiple users can participate in the game as players. Therefore, when unknown people compete, since the abilities and so forth of opponents in relation to a game are not known, in comparison with ordinary games in which a competition is held with game devices as opponents by employing these game devices as stand alone game devices, game progress can be afforded a surprise quality and it is possible to provide the game with a certain appeal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, when data such as that required for game progress is transferred using the Internet, data transfer rates vary depending on the communication line which users use, for example CATV (Cable Television), ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line), ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), and on the types of modem used, and, as a result of a disparity in data transfer rates, user operations are not reflected immediately in game progress, and advantages and disadvantages are produced with respect to the state of progress of the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, also depending on the capacities of the personal computers or the like employed by users as terminal devices, user operations are not reflected immediately in game progress, meaning that advantages and disadvantages are produced with respect to the state of progress of the game on account of differences in hardware capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when a competitive game is played between users when such a data transfer rate disparity and/or hardware capacity difference have not been dealt with, a user that uses a terminal device with a slow data transfer rate and a low hardware capacity is then unable to adequately demonstrate his or her own skill in the game itself. Consequently, the user cannot sustain his or her original interest in the network game, and becomes less interested in participating, meaning that it becomes impossible to smoothly manage the network game. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to resolve the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a network game progress control system, a network game progress control method and a network game progress control program which are capable of causing a network game between users to progress smoothly without being subject to effects caused by a data transfer rate disparity and/or a difference in hardware capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, the present invention relates to a network game progress control system, which causes a network game played in a game space by users to progress, comprising: a first terminal device, which is used by a first user; a second terminal device, which is used by a second user different from the first user; and a network game server device, which is communicably connected via a network with the first and second terminal devices, and which controls progress of a game played in a game space by the first and second users using the first and second terminal devices, wherein the first terminal device comprises first game progress means that causes a game to progress in accordance with a first progress state determined by first event information for determining a game progress state; and first event information transmission means which transmits the first event information to the network game server device; the network game server device comprises event information transfer means which transfers first event information, which is transmitted by the first event information transmission means, to the second terminal device; the second terminal device comprises first event information reception means which receives first event information transferred by the event information transfer means; second game progress means which causes a game to progress in accordance with a second progress state determined by second event information for determining the next game progress state after the game has been caused to progress in accordance with the first progress state determined by the first event information received by the first event information reception means; and second event information transmission means which transmits the second event information to the network game server device; the event information transfer means transfers second event information, which is transmitted by the second event information transmission means, to the first terminal device; the first terminal device further comprises second event information reception means which receives second event information transferred by the event information transfer means; and the first game progress means causes a game to progress such that the first progress state does not end until the second event information reception means receives the second event information, and causes a game to progress in accordance with the second progress state after the second event information reception means receives the second event information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention described in the above, the network game progress control system, which controls progress of a network game played in a game space by users, comprises a first terminal device, which is used by a first user; a second terminal device, which is used by a second user different from the first user; and a network game server device, which is communicably connected via a network with the first and second terminal devices, and which controls the progress of a game played in a game space by the first and second users using the first and second terminal devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The first terminal device comprises first game progress means that causes a game to progress in accordance with a first progress state determined by first event information for determining a game progress state; and first event information transmission means which transmits the first event information to the network game server device. The network game server device comprises event information transfer means which transfers first event information, which is transmitted by the first event information transmission means, to the second terminal device. The second terminal device comprises first event information reception means which receives first event information transferred by the event information transfer means; second game progress means which causes a game to progress in accordance with a second progress state determined by second event information for determining the next game progress state after the game has been caused to progress in accordance with the first progress state determined by the first event information received by the first event information reception means; and second event information transmission means which transmits the second event information to the network game server device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The event information transfer means comprised by the network game server device transfers second event information, which is transmitted by the second event information transmission means, to the first terminal device. The first terminal device further comprises second event information reception means which receives second event information transferred by the event information transfer means, and the first game progress means causes a game to progress such that the first progress state does not end until the second event information reception means receives the second event information, and causes a game to progress in accordance with the second progress state, which is determined by second event information, after the second event information reception means receives the second event information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In other words, in the first terminal device, the game is caused to progress in accordance with a first progress state determined by first event information for determining a game progress state, first event information is transmitted from the first terminal device to the network game server device, and the first event information thus transmitted is transferred from the network game server device to the second terminal device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At this time, in the second terminal device, first event information, which is transferred from the network game server device, is received; the game is caused to progress in accordance with a second progress state determined by second event information for determining the next game progress state, after the game has been caused to progress in accordance with the first progress state determined by the received first event information; second event information is transmitted to the network game server device; and transmitted second event information is transferred from the network game server device to the first terminal device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in the first terminal device, the game is caused to progress such that the first progress state does not end until the second event information is received, and the game is caused to progress in accordance with the second progress state determined by the second event information after the second event information is received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Consequently, even if there is a variation between the time for the transfer of first event information from the first terminal device to the second terminal device and the time for the transfer of second event information from the second terminal device to the first terminal device, which is caused by a difference in capacity between the first and second terminal devices and/or by a disparity in the data transfer rates of the communication lines used by the first and second terminal devices, in the first and second terminal devices, after the game is caused to progress in accordance with the first progress state, the game is caused to progress in accordance with the second progress state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading the following detailed description along with the accompanied drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A description will be provided hereinbelow, with reference to the drawings, of a network game system that is an example of the network game progress control system according to the first embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the constitution of the network game system according to one embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the description below, the description is with regard to a baseball game in which pre-registered members compete, which constitutes one example of a network game. However, the present invention is not limited to this example in particular. A network game in which a competition takes place between users can be applied to a variety of games, and can, for example, be similarly applied to sports games, fighting games, simulation games, shooting games, role-playing games, and other games. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The network game system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises a server system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a plurality of client computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The server system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and plurality of client computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected so as to be capable of communicating mutually via a network <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The client computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are terminal devices used by members who are users, and server system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a network game server device for managing a baseball game played in a game space by members using client computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> For the network <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the Internet may be used for example, such that a variety of information and the like can be mutually transmitted and received between the server system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the client computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in accordance with the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). The network <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is not limited to the Internet in particular; it is also possible to use another network such as an intranet, or a network in which a variety of networks such as the Internet and intranets are combined, or the like. Furthermore, the server system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the client computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may also be mutually connected by means of a dedicated line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Further, when the Internet is used as the network <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, normally, there are many cases where each of the client computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is connected via a modem or similar to a predetermined provider server and connected via this provider server to the network <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. However, in order to simplify the description, an illustration of such a provider server and a description thereof have been omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, users that use the client computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are members who have registered to receive a predetermined service which is provided by a company that manages network games, and a net competition (or net game) is conducted by means of a baseball game in which a batter character bats a ball object (equivalent to a ball in a real baseball game) pitched by a pitcher character as a result of a member using the client computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>operating a pitcher character (equivalent to a pitcher in a real baseball game) in a game space and a member using the client computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>operating a batter character (equivalent to a batter in a real baseball game) in the same game space, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Here, net competitions include a normal competition and an encounter league. The normal competition is a profile switching optional competition in which the exchange of profile information between opponents can be optionally performed, and the encounter league is a competition with profile exchange in which the exchange of profile information between opponents is invariably performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The members optionally access the server system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using the client computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and are able to conduct a normal competition and an encounter league in a game space constructed by the server system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the client computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, similarly to an ordinary baseball game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Next, the server system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described in detail. The server system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a member DB (database) server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, mail server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, lobby server <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, game server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, WWW (World Wide Web) server <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and game DB server <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The servers are connected by means of a predetermined network such as a LAN (Local Area Network), for example, so as to be at least capable of transmitting and receiving data and the like via a route like that illustrated. Further, the member DB server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, mail server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, lobby server <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and WWW server <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, are connected to the network <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via a communication device (omitted from the drawings) such as a router, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The member DB server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is constituted from an ordinary database server device or similar, and performs user member registration processing and the like when a user registers as a member in order to receive a predetermined service which is provided by a company that manages network games. Further, the member DB server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> manages member IDs, passwords, billing information, and the like, for each member, which are determined during member registration, by storing same in a database.
