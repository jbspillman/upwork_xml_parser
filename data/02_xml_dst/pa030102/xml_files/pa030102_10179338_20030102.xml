<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a multi-cylinder high-pressure plunger pump as it is used for producing high-pressure water jets which are used for different purposes as for cutting material like metal sheets or cleaning surfaces. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> German Published Patent Application DE 196 53 158 A1 discloses an axial plunger pump, there being provided a wobble plate which serves for moving the plungers via axially moveable plunger actuators each coupled to a plunger. The wobble plate here is mounted via a cam plate in relation to the housing and is at a fixed angle to the axis of rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, volume control of the pumped fluid is neither envisaged nor feasible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Japanese Published Patent Application JP 61-277881 A, furthermore, discloses a multi-cylinder high-pressure plunger pump in the case of which a multi-cylinder pump head with a row of cylinders is provided, the pump head being flanged onto a crank housing which accommodates a crankshaft and cranks which are driven by the latter and drive corresponding plungers such that they can be moved back and forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Apart from the fact that it is only possible here to adjust the pressure via the rotational speed of the crankshaft in relatively small ranges, the drive requires expensive components such as the crankshaft and the like. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention is to provide a multi-cylinder high-pressure plunger pump provided with a volume control. It is a further object of the invention to provide a multi-cylinder high-pressure plunger pump with a linear pressure control via the rotational drive speed of the pump. It is an additional object of the invention to provide a multi-cylinder high-pressure plunger pump of a simple construction and with a volume control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention proposes a multi-cylinder high-pressure plunger pump comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> a plurality of plungers arranged equidistantly on a circle; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> a drive unit for said plungers, said drive unit being arranged in a housing and comprising a drive part which is mounted rotatably in the housing and carries along a wobble plate with wobbling action about the axis of rotation of the drive part; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> axially moveable plunger actuators each coupled to a plunger being pressed against the wobble plate, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> wherein the drive part is a roller which has a cutout which extends in the direction of the axis of rotation of the roller and accommodates a mount in the manner of a ball-and-socket joint and rotating along with the roller; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> wherein said cutout is arranged in a hydraulically activatable piston which is mounted in a roller bore such that it is displaceable perpendicularly to the direction of rotation of the roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Since the plungers are arranged equidistantly on a circle and the drive unit comprises a roller about the axis of rotation of which a wobble plate is arranged with wobbling action, axially moveable plunger actuators each coupled to a plunger being pressed against said wobble plate, it is not just possible essentially to use, as the components, castings which do not require much machining, and to avoid expensive forgings; rather, apart from the fact that the pressure can be adjusted via the rotational drive speed of the pump, provision is also made for a linear volume control for example from zero up to a maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Further objects, embodiments and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description and the claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The high-pressure plunger pump illustrated comprises a housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for accommodating a drive unit with an input shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which can be coupled to a drive subassembly, such as an electric motor, on one end side of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Fastened on the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via screws <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the so-called cage, which has a panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which closes the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the end side located opposite the input shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> bears plunger actuators <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which are coupled to plungers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises a panel <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is spaced apart from the panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, parallel thereto, and bears a plurality of, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated three, pump heads <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, of which the longitudinal axes are arranged, corresponding to the longitudinal axes of the plungers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, equidistantly on a circle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is possible here for the plungers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, as has been described for example in the German Patent DE 198 19 972 C1 which is incorporated by reference hereby, to be guided in pressure sleeves, a suction valve and a pressure valve with corresponding valve elements arranged one behind the other being provided in each case coaxially in relation to the pressure-sleeve axis and connecting a working space of the respective plunger <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to an intake chamber and the working space to a pressure chamber of a common pressure space. It is possible here for the valve elements to comprise an insert body with a continuous bore which, on the one hand, is open to the working space of the associated plunger <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and, on the other hand, is closed by the pressure valve during the suction stroke of the associated plunger, said bore accommodating a pressure sleeve which, on the pressure-chamber side, is screwed to a pressure-valve guide sleeve which accommodates the pressure-valve elements, is supported against the insert body and clamps the pressure sleeve, on the plunger side, with sealing action against the insert body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises an essentially cylindrical section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, preferably in the form of a casting, which is closed on one end side by a cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which bears a stub <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is closed by a panel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and accommodates two rolling-contact bearings <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which are spaced apart by a ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and are intended for bearing the input shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The input shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> bears, at the end, a pinion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which meshes with an internally toothed hollow wheel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The hollow wheel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is arranged coaxially in relation to a roller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is screwed to the latter. The roller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is mounted rotatably in the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via rolling-contact bearings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The roller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may likewise be a casting which only requires a small amount of machining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The roller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a roller bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which runs transversely to the axis of the input shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and thus transversely to the axis of rotation of the roller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, accommodates a piston <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and, on the one hand, is closed by a panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and, on the other hand, is bounded by a stop ring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Located between the piston <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is connected, via corresponding bores <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, to a hydraulic rotary lead-through <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via which pressure medium can be fed to the chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as is indicated by dots in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. The piston <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has an encircling step <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which, before the piston <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is lifted off from the panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is pressure-activated in order to cause said piston to be lifted off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which shows a section along the longitudinal axis of the roller bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the piston <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a cutout <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is essentially rectangular in plan view and accommodates an insert <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The insert <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is of spherical design in the axial direction of the cutout <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and is seated via bearings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, for example needle bearings, at one end, the tapered end, of a pin <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The latter is routed out of the roller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a corresponding opening and screwed to an articulation fork <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is inserted into a cup-like depression of a wobble plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, reinforced on the rear side by ribs <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and provided with a sleeve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for accommodating the pin <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and is screwed to the wobble plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. The articulation fork <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is part of a spherical articulation <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which encloses a housing-mounted articulation fork <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and about which the wobble plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can be pivoted by being displaced from the central position, which is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, into a pivoted angle position, which is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If it is only intended to install a predetermined level of power which cannot be changed, there is no need to provide a displaceable piston <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The cutout <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be provided directly in the roller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The wobble plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> bears a hardened, and thus wear-resistant, pressure plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the plunger actuator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> being kept pressed against the same. The plunger actuators <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be moved axially in relation to the longitudinal axis of the plunger <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as a result of the wobbling movement of the wobble plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the pressure space <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> being correspondingly subjected to the action of pressure, the piston <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is adjusted in the roller bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as a result of which the angle of the wobble plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, articulated at the articulation <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, in relation to the longitudinal axes of the plunger actuator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and thus in relation to the longitudinal axes of the plungers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, is adjusted correspondingly. Since the plunger actuators <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are kept pressed against the pressure plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, this maintains a predetermined angle corresponding to a predetermined pressure, by means of which the pump stroke is determined. At 0&deg;, the pump stroke is zero. If the hydraulic pressure is reset to zero, the pressure to which the wobble plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is subjected by the plunger actuators <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> results in said wobble plate being guided back into its starting position from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> However, it is also possible for the pump to be designed such that the piston <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is activated by pressure fluid on both sides, rather than on just one side, in order for its position within the roller bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and thus for the pump stroke, to be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As a result of the roller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being rotated by being driven by means of the input shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the wobble plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> wobbles without rotating in relation to the roller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This results in a corresponding stroke of the plunger actuators <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and thus of the plungers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the articulation <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the embodiment illustrated there comprises a cross pin <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, of which the ends are mounted, via spherical sliding articulation bearings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in each case, in the two mutually opposite legs of the housing-mounted articulation fork <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and, offset through 90&deg; in relation to this, in the wobble-plate-side articulation fork <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This means that allowances can easily be made for production tolerances. Instead of the above, it is also possible to use any other type of cardanic joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> guide bushing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is provided for each plunger actuator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the guide bushing being inserted into a corresponding opening of the panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and being screwed to the latter. The plunger actuator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as a differential piston, is provided with a shoulder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as a result of which an annular space <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is formed in the guide bushing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, it being possible for said annular space to be subjected to the action of compressed air of, for example, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> bar from the outside, via an opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, in order for the plunger actuator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be kept pressed in abutment against the pressure plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The plunger actuator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has an inner bore <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which, adjacent to the pressure plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, is closed by an end piece <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which forms a stopper and has a spherical surface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> butting against the pressure plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A bore <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of small diameter leads from the annular space <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> into the space formed by the inner bore <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, in order for the latter space to act as a compensating reservoir, with the result that excessive heating of the compressed air is prevented. The compressed-air lines leading to the individual guide bushings <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are connected to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Instead of the plunger actuators <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> being activated by compressed air, it is also possible to provide a spring, although a greater overall length is required for this, so the embodiment from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The plunger actuator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, on the plunger side, has a blind bore <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, which accommodates a pressure plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the base. A bearing shoe <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with a spherical bearing surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> rolls on said pressure plate, and is arranged at the adjacent end of a plunger shoe <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, this end being pressed against the pressure plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by the bearing shoe <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, via cup springs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In this case, the assembly of cup springs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is subjected to stressing by means of a clamping sleeve <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, which is inserted into the blind bore <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and encloses the plunger shoe <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> at a distance from the latter. The plunger <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is thus correspondingly coupled in an articulated manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As can be gathered from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the high-pressure plunger pump has a hydraulic circuit which comprises an oil pump <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which, with the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, forms a circuit which also comprises a 3/2-way or 5/3-way valve <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, the latter having arranged downstream of it a pressure-regulating valve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> via which the pressure in the chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and thus the stroke of the high-pressure plunger pump, can be adjusted. In addition, a throttle nonreturn valve <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is arranged between the pressure-regulating valve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the hydraulic lead-through <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the claims. </paragraph>
