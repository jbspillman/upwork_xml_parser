The coupling unit further includes a lever <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> that has two opposite ends respectively connected to the driving unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via a shaft <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> and to the links <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> via a pin <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> and that is turnable relative to the driving unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so as to move the links <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal and transverse directions (X, Y), thereby moving the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> between the opened and closed positions. The driving unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes a motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, an output gear <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> driven by the motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and a driven gear <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> meshing with the output gear <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> and connected to the shaft <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> so as to turn the lever <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, which, in turn, moves the links <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal and transverse directions (X, Y). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A board shade <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> extends inclinedly in a first inclined direction from the first end <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of each of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> toward the second end <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of an adjacent one of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. A board guide <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends inclinedly in a second inclined direction from the second end <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of each of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> toward the first end <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of an adjacent one of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> so that the board shade <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of each of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the board guide <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of an adjacent one of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> move toward each other when the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> move from the opened position to the closed position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) so as to prevent rain and dust from entering into a building (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Two of the aforesaid solar energy collectors <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be mounted securely on the first and second ends <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Each of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can be further integrated with the aforesaid insulator unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which is attached to a bottom face of the slated boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that is opposite to a respective one of the solar cells <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The solar construction board or the solar louver of this invention integrates the functions of a conventional construction board or a conventional louver with the functions of the solar cells <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the solar energy collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and can be applied to many indoor-outdoor interface constructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a second preferred embodiment of the solar louver modified from the previous embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> at a closed position. The solar louver is similar to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, except that the board shed <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the board guide <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are replaced with opposite transparent first and second circular halves <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>&prime; which respectively extend from the first and second ends <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>&prime; of each of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime;. The first circular half <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>&prime; of each of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime; complements the second circular half <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>&prime; of an adjacent one of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime; to form a circular tube that performs the same functions as the transparent tube <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Preferably, each of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime; is made from a transparent plastic material. The heating tubes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&prime; in the circular tubes are supported by the respective pins <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; via connecting members <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>&prime;. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the solar louver at an opened position (rotation of the slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime; from the closed position to the opened position proceeds in a manner similar to that of the previous embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>), wherein, the complementary first and second circular halves <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>&prime; <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>&prime; of the adjacent slanted boards <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime; are separated from each other. The modified construction of the solar louver of this embodiment facilitates cleaning of the first and second circular halves <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>&prime; of the circular tubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates how the solar louver of this invention can be used to serve as a roof window <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> on a roof <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With the invention thus explained, it is apparent that various modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention. It is therefore intended that the invention be limited only as recited in the appended claims. </paragraph>
