<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This patent specification relates generally to a semiconductor device and methods for fabricating such device, and more specifically to a semiconductor device incorporating either an LDMOS transistor or a bipolar transistor with LDMOS structure, for suitable use in device applications with high withstand voltage. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As the use of semiconductor devices incorporating regulator and DC/DC converter circuits becomes more widespread, it is increasingly important to meet the demands for higher output currents of these devices among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In one approach to achieve the high output currents, LDMOS transistors have been attracting much attention, which operate with low on resistance. In addition, the LDMOS transistors are known to have a structure suitable for miniaturization with a decreased chip area yet attaining high withstand voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;LDMOS (lateral double-diffusion MOS) transistor&rdquo; is a field effect transistor, including at least a low concentration impurity doped layer (channel well region) formed to surround a source, and for the surface portions of the channel well region under a gate electrode to serve as a channel. In addition, by &ldquo;conventional MOS transistor&rdquo; is meant herein one having a drain with an impurity concentration larger than that of a channel region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view illustrating an N-type LDMOS transistor previously known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the LDMOS transistor comprises an N-type high resistance silicon substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the structure including a polysilicon gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> formed with a contiguously underlying gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and a channel well region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> formed by implanting, using the source side edge portion of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as a mask, then thermally diffusing P-type impurity ions so as for a portion thereof to serve as a channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition, N-type low resistance source and drain <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, respectively, are formed by implanting, using the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as a mask, and then thermally diffusing P-type impurity ions. Also included are an interlayer dielectric layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and electrode wirings, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, connected to the N-type source and drain, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, respectively (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 7-302903). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When an LDMOS transistor is utilized as a high voltage CMOS transistor, several improvements are made to relax the electric field strength in the region between drain and gate electrode. As an example, the thickness at the drain side edge of a gate oxide <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is increased, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, or alternatively, a field oxide layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed in the vicinity of the drain edge portion contiguously under the gate oxide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, having a thickness larger than that of the gate oxide layer, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition, the drain <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the above structures is formed as a medium concentration drain region contiguously under the thick oxide layer, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, having a concentration of N-type impurity higher than that of the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and lower than that of the N-type drain <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Also, the region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in these structures serves as a contact region to be connected to the channel well region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In these structures, however, there arise several drawbacks which will be described as follows. For example, the size of the transistor has to be increased in proportion to the area required for forming the thick oxide layer, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In addition, the drain resistance is also increased in a similar manner. As a result, the on resistance of the transistor increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Also, in the stricture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, another difficulty may arise during photolithography and etching process steps for forming the gate oxide <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Namely, transistor characteristics may vary considerably depending on the degree of precision in these alignment and etching steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Although the precision in forming the field oxide layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the drain edge portion shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference> can be increased by using the LOCOS (local oxidation of silicon) method, the transistor characteristics may be deteriorated by the crystal structural disorder which is induced by the field oxide layer formed as above at the region under the gate oxide. In these structures of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8C</cross-reference>, therefore, difficulties arise in implementing the miniaturization of the transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In contrast, in the structure without increasing the gate oxide layer thickness in the drain edge portion as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the concentration of the electric field in this portion may cause the deterioration in threshold voltage by the N-type drain <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at the region contiguously formed under the gate oxide <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Although this deterioration in the withstand voltage can be reduced to a certain degree-by lowering the N-type impurity concentration in the oxide side portion of the drain <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, this lowered concentration region, in turn, may cause deteriorating effect on the withstand voltage, since a depletion layer extends to the low concentration region with relative ease even at relatively low voltages applied to the drain <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In order to improve the characteristics of the LDMOS transistor by increasing the withstand voltage, there disclosed is a structure including a high concentration drain formed spatially separated from a gate electrode. The structure is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> as a diagrammatic cross-sectional view of an N-channel type LDMOS transistor previously known (which is hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;Prior art 1&rsquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, an N-type drain well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed in a P-type semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the N-type drain well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is subsequently formed. An N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>is formed in the P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Also formed in the N-type well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a medium concentration N-type drain <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, which is situated spatially separated from the P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> having a concentration of N-type impurities introduced higher than that of the N-type well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, made of polysilicon, is formed with an underlying gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ox </italic></highlight>interposed between the gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and the well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. This gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is formed in intermediate between N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>and N-type drain <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>above N-type well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, overlying the P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and being separated from the N-type drain <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the surface of the P-type channel well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> under the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>serves as a channel region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The on resistance of LDMOS transistor is determined by the sum of channel resistance, drain resistance, and source resistance. In the aforementioned N-channel type LDMOS transistor (Prior art 1), its source resistance is decreased by forming the N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>in the self-aligned manner with respect to the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> However, the drain resistance for drain <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is relatively high due to a large resistance component of the N-type well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the drain resistance becomes dominant compared with a decreasing channel resistance in the range of high gate voltage. As a result, there arises a difficulty in the previous channel type LDMOS transistor, in that drain current cannot be increased as desired with the increase in the gate voltage, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Namely, although the drain current Id increases with increasing drain voltage Vg up to approximately 3V, almost no increase in Id is observed beyond this voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In addition, there encountered is another difficulty as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, in which a drain breakdown is caused with relative ease after parasitic bipolar operations in the high voltage range for MOS transistor drain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In order to obviate such difficulties, an LDMOS transistor is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 7-302903, in which its source and drain are formed by double diffusion to thereby improve the transistor characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Although the electric field strength in vicinity of the drain is relaxed to a certain degree in this stricture through the double diffusion, an overlap exists between the high concentration drain and the edge portion of the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When the present inventors fabricated an LDMOS transistor according to that disclosure, it was found that the drain withstand voltage was obtained approximately 10 V at most, possibly due to a relatively small width of the aforementioned low concentration diffusion region formed by the double diffusion and a concomitant gate modulation effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A further assumption was made also by the present inventors from the above results that it was appropriate for a high concentration drain to be formed spatially separated sufficiently from the gate electrode with a distance of 1.0 &mgr;m or greater, for example. This and related points will be detailed later on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In order to improve the drain voltage characteristics, another structure of the LDMOS transistor is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 10-335663, in which implantation and subsequent diffusion process steps are carried out into the surface of a well region between a gate electrode and a high concentration drain in the self-aligned manner for forming a low resistance region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this structure, however, a source of the transistor is not formed in the self-aligned manner, thereby resulting in remaining source resistance. As a result, there remains some source resistance, which is insufficient for reducing the on resistance of the transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present inventor then formed another LDMOS transistor according to the disclosure, with the exception that both source and drain were formed in the self-aligned manner (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view of the thus formed N-channel type LDMOS transistor (which is hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;Prior art 2&rsquo;), in which components operating in a similar manner to those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> are shown with identical numerical representation and descriptions thereof are herein abbreviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, there formed are N-type source, drain, gate oxide layer, gate electrode and drain well region, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ox</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, respectively, and a P-type channel well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>is formed in the self-aligned manner with respect to the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An N-type medium concentration drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed in the surface region of the N-type drain well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the side of the N-type drain <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The N -type medium concentration drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed also in the self-aligned manner with respect to the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>. In addition, the N-type medium concentration drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed with a depth from the surface smaller than that of the N-type drain <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the thus formed structure provided with the N-type medium concentration drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, drain currents Id during MOS operations have been improved in the range of high gate voltage Vg over those obtained with the structure of the aforementioned Prior art 1, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> However, the drain thermal breakdown takes place during parasitic bipolar operations at a drain current Id of approximately 12 mA in the higher range of the applied gate voltage Vg, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference>. This is therefore indicative of a still persisting difficulty of low withstand voltage which is unsatisfactory in practice for the LDMOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The improvements in transistor characteristics such as withstand voltage and on resistance have been described herein above with respect to the LDMOS transistors, in that its on resistance is reduced and transistor characteristics are stabilized for the LDMOS transistor. It is desirable, however, for the LDMOS transistor to have additional improvements in the reduced on resistance for use in practical device applications as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As an example, the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed relatively thin so as to reduce the on resistance, and this small thickness has an effect on the voltage applied thereto. That is, the LDMOS transistor has to be operated under the voltage applied to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> so as not to breakdown the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed with a thickness of 25 nm, for example, a voltage of 25 V or larger is known to cause the layer breakdown with relative ease, thereby indicating the voltage normally applied to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the order of 15 V at most. As a result, the range of the gate voltage has to be set different from that of the drain voltage for driving the LDMOS transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> This is exemplified by DC/DC device products, in which the efficiency is one of the factors of practical importance for the products. In order to achieve the efficiency, inverter outputs are necessitated at the input potential (source voltage) and the ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Although one of the means for achieving the efficiency is to control the voltage input to the gate electrode, which is carried out by lowering this voltage by an internal stepdown circuit, for example, this method is not so efficient after all, since the efficiency is reduced to a certain degree since the steps of lowering the voltage are already involved. It is desirable, therefore, to obviate such a difficulty mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> There is a method previously known for preventing such difficulty, in which a bipolar transistor is utilized as a switching element having high withstand voltages in place of the LDMOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Since the function of the base diffusion layer of bipolar transistor corresponds to that of the gate electrode of LDMOS transistor, the bipolar transistor is operated to control the input not by applied voltage, but by forward current flow. As a result, the input voltage is known as small as on the order of one volt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve low on resistance values for a bipolar transistor, the vertical type thereof is generally formed. In the vertically constructed bipolar transistor, however, the structure includes an epitaxial layer as the collector, a buried layer, and a collector wall diffusion layer for decreasing collector resistance. In addition, the structure has to also include an isolation diffusion layer for implement the diffusion isolation from other elements. The vertical bipolar transistor, therefore, has a drawback such as complicated process steps for the fabrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In contrast, another type of bipolar transistor is known with laterally constructed structure (lateral bipolar transistor), which can be fabricated with relatively simpler process steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the lateral bipolar transistor, however, its collector-emitter distance has to be sufficiently separated to satisfy high withstand voltage requirements. Therefore, a difficulty arises in the lateral bipolar transistor, in that current amplification remains low compared with the vertical bipolar transistor, since the base width increases and the surface portion only between collector and gate is available for the current flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present inventors have investigated in detail an LDMOS structure of the bipolar transistor, which can be fabricated with simpler process including the step of forming double diffusion structure with the layers of different conductivity types, which is carried out in the self-aligned manner with respect to a polysilicon gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> This LDMOS structure includes a drain diffusion layer, a channel diffusion layer, and a source diffusion layer. These layers are constructed to have a lateral bipolar structure in the region directly below a gate oxide layer, and a vertical bipolar transistor structure further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the drain, channel, and source diffusion layers are operated to function as a collector, base, and emitter, respectively, the bipolar transistor with the LDMOS structure may be capable of retaining high withstand voltages even after decreasing its base width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> However, there remains a difficulty yet to be solved for the LDMOS structure of the bipolar transistor, in that the gate oxide layer is deteriorated when high voltages are applied to the gate electrode. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides a semiconductor device incorporating an LDMOS transistor or a bipolar transistor for use in high withstand voltage device applications, and its method of fabrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor device disclosed herein includes at least an LDMOS transistor. The LDMOS transistor comprises a semiconductor substrate; a uniformly thick gate oxide layer provided on the semiconductor substrate; a gate electrode provided on the gate oxide layer; a drain well region of a first conductivity type formed in a region including the gate electrode; a channel well region of a second conductivity type, which is opposite to the first conductivity type, with an ion impurity concentration greater than the drain well region; the channel well region formed in the drain well region having a partial overlap with the gate electrode; a source of the first conductivity type formed contiguously to one side of the gate electrode in the channel well region; a medium concentration drain region of a first conductivity type with an ion impurity concentration greater than the drain well region; the medium concentration drain region formed in the drain well region having a partial overlap with a different side of the gate electrode; and a drain of a first conductivity type with an ion impurity concentration greater than the medium concentration drain region; the drain of a first conductivity type formed in the medium concentration drain region which is spatially separated from the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in this fabricated LDMOS transistor, the drain is formed in the drain well region having a partial overlap with one of the sides of the gate electrode. Accordingly, a suitable drain threshold and a low on resistance is achieved for the LDMOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, a method for fabricating an LDMOS transistor is disclosed herein, which comprises the steps of forming a drain well region of a first conductivity type in a semiconductor substrate; forming a uniformly thick gate oxide layer contiguously above the surface of the drain well region; forming a gate electrode contiguously above the gate oxide layer; forming a channel well region of a second conductivity type which is opposite to the first conductivity type, in an area in the drain well region that is contiguous to one side of the gate electrode in a self-aligned manner respective to the gate electrode, by first implanting impurity ions of a second conductivity type into the region and then thermally diffusing the impurity ions; forming a medium concentration drain region of a first conductivity type in an area in the drain well region opposite to the channel well region in a self-aligned manner respective to the gate electrode, by implanting impurity ions of a first conductivity type into the region, and forming a source, and a drain of a first conductivity type in the medium concentration drain region and the channel well region, respectively, by implanting impurity ions of a first conductivity type; such that the drain is spatially separated from the gate electrode having a depth smaller than the medium concentration drain region and the channel well region, and such that the source is self-aligned with respect to the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an LDMOS transistor fabricated with the methods herein, has an improved on resistance and drain threshold voltage. In addition, the source&apos;s resistance is decreased and the fabricated transistor&apos;s characteristics are more stabilized since the source is formed in a self-aligned manner with respect to the gate electrode. Similarly, the drain resistance is decreased and the fabricated transistor&apos;s characteristics are more stabilized since the medium concentration drain region is self-aligned with respect to the gate electrode. The fabricated transistor&apos;s characteristics are further stabilized since the channel well region is self-aligned with respect to the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present disclosure to provide a bipolar transistor device having an LDMOS structure capable of preventing the breakdown of gate oxide layers; whereby, stable operational characteristics are acquired with as desirable current amplification factor linearity despite reduced base width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The bipolar transistor device includes at least a collector, comprising a diffusion layer of a first conductivity type, formed within a semiconductor substrate; a gate dielectric layer provided on the semiconductor substrate; a gate electrode provided on the gate dielectric layer; a base, comprising a diffusion layer of a second conductivity type opposite to the first conductivity type, formed in the collector having a partial overlap with the gate electrode; an emitter, made of a diffusion layer of a first conductivity type, formed in near one side of the gate electrode in the base; a high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the base, comprising a diffusion layer of a second conductivity type, opposite to the first conductivity type, formed in the base which is spatially separated from the emitter; and a high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the collector, comprising a diffusion layer of a first conductivity type, formed in the collector on an opposite side of the gate electrode, in which a wiring is formed to connect the gate electrode with the base, such that they are equipotential to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment, the bipolar transistor can be fabricated in an analogous manner as described above, with the exception that the wiring is formed to connect the gate electrode with the emitter, such that they are equipotential to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In either exemplary embodiment of a bipolar transistor: (1) the gate electrode and the base are equipotential to each other, or (2) the gate electrode and the emitter are equipotential to each other, assuming that the emitter and base are first brought to be equipotential to each other and then the transistor is turned off. If a potential difference is created between the collector (corresponding to the drain of DMOS) and the base (corresponding to the channel of DMOS), a depleted region is created at an interface between the collector and base. Alternatively, a depleted region can be created in the interface region on both sides of the collector and the base, in a similar manner to the off-state of the LDMOS transistor; whereby, high withstand voltages then can be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> However, if the emitter and base are not brought to be equipotential to each other again, in either embodiments of (1) or (2) with the transistor turned on, the potential between the base and emitter becomes forward-biased, which is in contrast to DMOS (double-diffused MOS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the first exemplary embodiment (1), with the bipolar transistor turned on, when a potential is applied to the emitter and gate electrode, the voltage created between the base and the emitter is only a forward-biased voltage. A high voltage does not appear at the gate electrode of the transistor. Accordingly, the breakdown of the gate dielectric layer can be prevented even when a high voltage (i.e., the source potential) is applied. Therefore, stable operational characteristics is obtained for a bipolar transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the second exemplary embodiment (2), with the bipolar transistor turned on, when a potential is applied to the base and gate electrode, the potential applied becomes forward-biased because of the forward-biased voltage that exists between the base and emitter. As a result, a forward-biased voltage is applied to the gate electrode. Accordingly, breakdown of the gate dielectric layer can be prevented even when a high voltage (i.e., the source potential) is applied. Therefore, stable operational characteristics is also obtained for a bipolar transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the emitter and high concentration ohmic diffusion layer (both are high concentration diffusion layers) are in close proximity to each other in the base, a junction leak between emitter and base can increase in either exemplary embodiments (1) or (2). Therefore, the emitter and high concentration ohmic diffusion layer (which connects the base) are spatially formed separate from each other in the fabricated transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In addition, the fabricated structures with respective wiring as illustrated in exemplary embodiments (1) and (2), the function of the transistor depends on the lateral bipolar structure in the region directly below the gate oxide layer. This lateral structure enables formation of a concentration gradient through the collector, base, and emitter layers in the transistor, thereby decreasing the base width. Accordingly, bipolar transistors can be fabricated with reduced chip areas a having high efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, a method for fabricating a bipolar transistor is disclosed which comprises the steps of forming a collector, comprising a diffusion layer of a first conductivity type within a semiconductor substrate; providing a gate dielectric layer contiguously above the surface of the collector; providing a gate electrode contiguously above the gate dielectric layer; providing a base, comprising a diffusion layer of a second conductivity type opposite to the first conductivity type, within the collector contiguous to one side of the gate electrode, self-aligned with respect to the gate electrode; first by implantation of impurity ions of a second conductivity type into the region and then thermally diffusing the impurity ions; forming a high concentration ohmic diffusion layer that connects the collector of a first conductivity type in the base, which is in close proximity to the gate electrode on the other side of the gate electrode with respect to the base, self-aligned with respect to the gate electrode, by implantation of impurity ions of a first conductivity type; forming an emitter, comprising a diffusion layer of a first conductivity type in the base, a self-aligned with respect to the gate electrode; forming a high concentration ohmic diffusion layer to connect the base of a second conductivity type, in the base spatially separated from the emitter, by implantation of impurity ions of a second conductivity type; and forming a wiring to connect the gate electrode with the base such that they are equipotential to each another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment, a bipolar transistor can be fabricated in an analogous manner, as described above, with the exception that the wiring is formed to connect the gate electrode with the emitter, such that they are equipotential to each other. This step is in lieu of forming a wiring to connect the gate electrode with the base, such that they are equipotential to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> According to the varying embodiments, a bipolar transistor can be fabricated with the gate electrode and the base connected, such that they are equipotential to each other, or a bipolar transistor can be fabricated with the gate electrode and the emitter connected, such that they are equipotential to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In addition, the base and emitter are formed self-aligned to the gate electrode. This enables one to determine the current amplification factor of the bipolar transistor with the lateral bipolar transistor structure, and also the base width as small as predetermined, through which most of the current flow exists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, by forming the base and emitter self-aligned to the gate electrode, the dispersion in alignment of the base width during photolithographic processing steps can be made small enough so that it is disregarded. Accordingly, a bipolar transistor with high-efficiency formed with a reduced chip area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The features and advantages thereof of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description and appended claims when read in conjunction with the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the detailed description which follows, specific embodiments on a semiconductor device incorporating either an LDMOS transistor or a bipolar transistor, and methods for fabricating such semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> It is understood, however, that the present disclosure is not limited to these embodiments, and it is appreciated that the device and the method disclosed herein may also be adaptable to any form of semiconductor devices. Other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In addition, the first half of the following description relates semiconductor devices incorporating LDMOS and MOS transistors, while the second half relates bipolar transistors primarily having the LDMOS structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In an LDMOS semiconductor incorporated into a semiconductor device disclosed herein, as will be detailed herein below, the LDMOS semiconductor is formed in a semiconductor substrate, including at least a medium concentration drain region formed preferably having an impurity concentration smaller than that of a channel well region. As a result, an undue decrease in the effective channel length can be obviated, which may be caused during thermal diffusion process steps for forming both medium concentration drain region and channel well region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Also in the semiconductor device, the semiconductor substrate is of P conductivity type and the LDMOS transistor also of P-channel type. Further included are conventional P-channel type, and N-channel type MOS transistors, in which two regions for forming therein the P-channel type LDMOS transistor and the P-channel type MOS transistor, respectively, are preferably formed simultaneously in an N-type isolation well region in the semiconductor substrate, and a P-type drain well region for forming the P-channel type LDMOS transistor and a P-type well region for forming a conventional N-channel type MOS transistor are formed simultaneously in the N-type isolation well region. As a result, process steps can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the case of another semiconductor device, the semiconductor substrate is of P conductivity type and the LDMOS transistor is of N-channel type. Further included is a conventional P-channel type MOS transistor, in which an N-type drain well region for forming the N-channel type LDMOS transistor and an N-type well region for forming the conventional P-channel type MOS transistor are formed simultaneously in the semiconductor substrate. As a result, process steps can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Although P conductivity type of semiconductor substrates are utilized for forming the above semiconductor devices, N conductivity type of substrates may alternatively be used to form semiconductor devices including components of the opposite conductivity type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> When both LDMOS transistor and conventional N-channel type MOS transistor are incorporated into the semiconductor device, the gate oxide layer formed contiguously under the LDMOS transistor has a thickness smaller than that of the conventional MOS transistor. This facilitates to decrease on resistance for the LDMOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor devices disclosed herein may suitably be incorporated into several circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> For example, there provided is a power source unit with a circuit capable of outputting a constant voltage by performing, comparison operations between an output voltage and a reference voltage, and feedback operations based on comparison results. By incorporating the LDMOS transistor disclosed herein, the area for output driver can be reduced because of decreased on resistance values of the transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As another example, a charge pump type DC/DC converter may be provided for outputting a persistent current flow by charging and discharging a capacitor performed by repeated switching operations with a plurality of integrated switches. By utilizing the LDMOS transistor disclosed herein as at least one of the switches, the chip area required for resistors in practical products can be reduced, since decreased on resistance values facilitate to increase current supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In the methods for fabricating a semiconductor device disclosed herein, the step of thermally diffusing impurity ions during the formation of the medium concentration drain region is preferably carried out after ion implantation steps. This gives rise to an increase in the region of the medium concentration drain compared with the region formed without thermal diffusion, to thereby result in an increase in the number of ions possibly introduced in the region. As a result, the resistance of the medium concentration drain region can be decreased along with a decrease in drain resistance yet maintaining high threshold voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Also, in the methods for fabricating the semiconductor device, the step of thermally diffusing impurity ions for forming the medium concentration drain region is preferably carried out simultaneously with the step of thermally diffusing impurity ions for forming the channel well region. As a result, the medium concentration drain region can be increased without adding any further thermal diffusion step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the method for fabricating the semiconductor device, the number of impurity ions implanted for forming the channel well region is preferably greater than that for forming the medium concentration drain region. As a result, an undue decrease in the effective channel length can be obviated, which may be caused during thermal diffusion process steps for forming both medium concentration drain region and channel well region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> When both LDMOS transistor and conventional MOS transistor are incorporated into the semiconductor device, respective polysilicon gate electrodes of these two transistors are formed simultaneously in order to reduce the process steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In addition, in order to fully develop the characteristics of the LDMOS transistor, the channel well region thereof has to be formed in the self-aligned manner with respect to the gate electrode. The sequence of process steps, therefore, begins with channel doping steps for determining a threshold of the conventional type MOS transistors, which are followed by thermal diffusing steps at high temperatures for forming the channel well region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Since the impurity layer in a buried channel type transistor, which contains impurity ions of conductivity type opposite to that of the substrate, becomes deeper by the thermal diffusion steps, and the gate electric field becomes ineffective to the entire region of the channel. In order to suppress concomitant undue leakage, the threshold value has to be increased in order to decrease the above mentioned depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The threshold may reach 1.2 V or higher in such a case, which is larger than operation voltages for the practical products. This may thus result in a considerable difficulty. As long as utilizing previous process steps, therefore, all transistors have to be formed with those of the surface channel type to alleviate the above noted difficulty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Also, in the above noted process steps, the introduction of P-type impurity ions into the P-type polysilicon gate electrode of the conventional P-channel type MOS transistor is required prior to thermal diffusion steps for forming the channel well region. (The conventional P-channel type MOS transistor is hereinafter referred to as PchMOS.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> However, when the thermal diffusion steps are carried out under previously known conditions of 1100&deg; C. for 120 to 240 min, for example, boron ions previously contained in the polysilicon gate electrode diffuse out therefrom into the channel region through the underlying gate oxide layer, i.e., &lsquo;punch-through effect&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> This may also cause the difficulty, i.e., the decrease in the threshold voltage. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, this effect is enhanced with the increase in the gate length and the concentration of boron ions in the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when threshold values are decreased in the PchMOS transistor and P-channel type LDMOS transistor provided with respective P-type polysilicon gates, a thin layer is formed in the surface area of the N-type substrate, having a reduced concentration of N-type impurities caused by the compensation with punched-through boron ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Since this may cause a leakage in the channel surface region with relative ease even in thus fabricated surface channel type transistors, there persists the difficulty in decreasing the threshold values in these P-channel type transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it has become requisite for the present inventors to find the optimum concentration of P-type impurities in P-type polysilicon gate electrodes in the PchMOS transistors, which will be described herein below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In another aspect on the method for fabricating the semiconductor device disclosed herein, there provided are a PchMOS formed in the semiconductor substrate, provided with a P-type polysilicon gate electrode doped with P-type impurity ions formed contiguously above a gate oxide layer; and an LDMOS transistor provided with a channel well region formed, by thermal diffusion steps, contiguously under a gate electrode having a partial overlap with the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In addition, the P-type polysilicon gate electrode is made of polysilicon layer having a thickness of at least 500 nm and a concentration of the P-type impurity ions ranging from 2.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>to 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>, and thermal diffusion process steps following an ion implantation for forming the channel well region are carried out at a temperature ranging from 1050 to 1100&deg; C. for a period of time ranging from 100 to 500 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> By bringing the P-type impurity concentration of the P-type polysilicon gate electrode to be the above-mentioned range, and by carrying out the thermal diffusion steps also under the above mentioned conditions, it has been found the resultant impurity concentration following the process steps remains within the range, in which the decrease in PchMOS threshold values and the leakage in channel surface region can effectively be obviated, since it is assured by the above P-type impurity concentration that no effect on the substrate impurity concentration is caused even taking the punch-through effect into consideration. It may be added that boron ions are used as the P-type impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect, the method for fabricating the semiconductor device may preferably include a further step for forming the P-type polysilicon gate electrode by first forming a polysilicon layer without including impurity ions on the gate oxide, second forming a silicon oxide layer on the polysilicon layer to a thickness ranging from 25 to 50 nm, and subsequently doping P-type impurity ions by implanting through the silicon oxide layer such that an impurity concentration in the polysilicon layer reach the above noted concentration ranging from 2.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>to 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As a result, the punch-through by P-type ions through the gate oxide layer can be prevented during ion implantation for forming P-type polysilicon gate electrode, which is caused by channeling through grain boundaries, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As the conventional MOS transistors described herein above in this disclosure, there may alternatively be used are those having either the LDD (double doped drain) structure or LOCOS structure including a thick oxide layer at the gate edge portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The bipolar semiconductor having the LDMOS structure disclosed herein will now be detailed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The bipolar transistor includes at least a semiconductor substrate, a collector formed in the substrate, a gate dielectric layer formed on the substrate, a gate electrode formed further thereon, a base formed in the collector having a partial overlap with the gate electrode, an emitter formed in close proximity to one side of the gate electrode in the base, a high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the base, formed in the base spatially separated from the emitter, and a high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the collector, formed in the collector on the other side of the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In addition, a wiring in the transistor is formed for connecting either the gate electrode with the base to be equipotential one another, or the gate electrode with the emitter again to be equipotential one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In the bipolar transistor, since the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the collector and the gate electrode are preferably formed spatially separated one another in the transistor, the gate modulation effect can be suppressed and threshold voltages are increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> For forming the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the collector and the gate electrode spatially separated one another, as mentioned above, a medium concentration collector is preferably formed in the collector in intermediate between the gate electrode and the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting collector, which is made of a diffusion layer of the first conductivity type having an impurity concentration larger than the collector, and smaller than the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting collector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> As a result, a collector resistance between the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the collector and gate electrode can be reduced, and the current amplification factor can be increased in the high current range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The bipolar transistors disclosed herein may suitably be incorporated into several circuits. For example, a power source unit may be provided being capable of outputting a constant voltage by performing comparison operations between an output voltage and a reference voltage, and feedback operations based on comparison results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> By incorporating preferably the bipolar transistor disclosed herein as the output driver for the power source unit, the area for output driver can be reduced yet maintaining high threshold voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As another example, a charge pump type DC/DC converter may be provided for outputting a persistent current flow by charging and discharging a capacitor performed by repeated switching operations of a plurality of internal switches. By utilizing the bipolar transistor disclosed herein as at least one of its internal switches, the chip area required for resistors in practical products can be decreased yet maintaining high threshold voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In the methods for fabricating a semiconductor device disclosed herein, the step of forming the medium concentration collector is preferably carried out immediately after the step of forming the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In addition, the medium concentration collector, made of a diffusion layer of the first conductivity type, is herein formed in the collector on the other side of the gate electrode from the base in the self-aligned manner with respect to the gate electrode by implanting impurity ions of the first conductivity type, and the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the collector is formed, at the step of forming the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the collector, spatially separated from the gate electrode in close proximity to the medium concentration collector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The position of the medium concentration collector is therefore determined by the edge of the gate electrode. As a result, the dispersion in alignment of the distance between the medium concentration collector and the base during photolithographic process steps can be made small enough to be disregarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Having generally described the present disclosure, the following examples are provided further to illustrate preferred embodiments. This is intended to be illustrative but not to be limiting to the materials, devices or methods described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In addition, the first half of the following section relates semiconductor devices incorporating LDMOS and MOS transistors, while the second half primarily relates bipolar transistors having LDMOS structure. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view illustrating an NchLDMOS transistor according one embodiment disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an N-type drain well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed in a P-type substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In the N-type drain well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is subsequently formed, a portion of which serves as a channel region. In addition, an N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>is formed in the P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Also formed in the N-type well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is spatially separated from the P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> having a concentration of N-type impurities such as, for example, phosphorous ions higher than that of the N-type well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an N-type drain <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is formed in the medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having another concentration of N-type impurities such as, for example, phosphorous ions higher than that of the medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> An N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, made of polysilicon, is formed with an underlying gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ox </italic></highlight>interposed between the gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and the well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. This gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is disposed in intermediate between N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>and N-type drain <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>above N-type well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, overlying the spatial portion between the P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and spatially separated from the N-type drain <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The distance between the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and the N-type drain <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is 1.5 &mgr;m, for example, and the thickness of the gate oxide <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ox </italic></highlight>is approximately 30 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> As a result, the surface of the P-type channel well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> under the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is operative as a channel region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is doped by either implanting or thermally diffusing with N-type impurities such as, for example, phosphorus ions to a concentration typically of 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>. The N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>, the P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and the medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are formed in the self-aligned manner with respect to the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Into the P-type channel well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, P-type impurities such as, for example, boron ions are implanted to a concentration of 6.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>16 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>. Also, phosphorus ions are implanted as N-type impurities into the N-type drain well region <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to have a concentration of 6.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>in the region between N-type drain <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and P-type channel well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (drain <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). In the NchMOS <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, therefore, the drain <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has an impurity concentration smaller than that of the channel region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> With the device structure disclosed herein above, the impurity concentration in drain surface region at the edge portion of the N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (i.e., in the medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) is retained in the same order as that in the device previously disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 10-335663, even after implanting into the medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with a dose ranging two or three times of the previous level. As a result, no reduction in the gate modulated withstand voltage is assured for the device with the present structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be formed having a larger diffusion depth, the resistance can be considerably reduced in this region. Furthermore, since the N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>and the medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are formed in the self-aligned manner with respect to the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>as indicated earlier, the stability of the device characteristics can be increased over the previous device of the application &apos;663. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> As a result, drain currents Id in relatively high range of gate voltage Vg can be larger than those obtained with the previous devices disclosed in the applications, &apos;663 and &apos;903, thereby leading to smaller on-resistance values with increased gate voltages, as evidenced by the results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. In addition, another improvement is achieved in thermal characteristics during parasitic bipolar operations, in which the drain withstand voltage (drain voltage Vd) of the order of 35 V is obtained even for drain current Id as much as 15 mA, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C, thereby indicating an increase in the drain withstand voltage over previous devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In order to implement the formation of the N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>, the P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and the medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the self-aligned manner with respect to the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, phosphorus and boron ions have to be introduced into the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>during the process steps for forming the N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>, P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> It is noted herein with respect to the impurity concentration that no appreciable effect on transistor characteristics is found such as, for example, threshold voltage, on resistance, and withstand voltage, since the phosphorus concentration for determining the polarity of the N-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is over ten times as large as that implanted into the N-type source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>, the P-type well region <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and the medium concentration N-type drain region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view illustrating a semiconductor device according to another embodiment disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The structure includes a low voltage CMOS region consisting of a conventional N-channel MOS transistor (NchMOS) and a conventional P-channel MOS transistor (PchMOS), and a high voltage CMOS region consisting of a P-channel LDMOS transistor (PchLDMOS) and an N-channel LDMOS transistor (NchLDMOS), in which LDMOS transistors disclosed herein are utilized in the present structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> low voltage CMOS region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a high voltage CMOS region <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed in a P-type semiconductor substrate (P-type substrate) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a resistance of approximately 20 &square;cm. In the low voltage CMOS region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a PchMOS <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and an NchMOS <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are formed. The voltage applied to either PchMOS <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or NchMOS <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is approximately 5 V, for example. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> In contrast, on transmitting a negative voltage from the oscillator OSC <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, the transistors PchLDMOS <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and NchMOS <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> are turned off, while other NchMOS transistors <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> are turned on.

Appropriate wirings, <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, are then formed on the interlayer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> Subsequently electrically connected are the emitter <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> to the ground potential <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> by way of an emitter wiring <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, the high concentration N-type ohmic diffusion layer for collector <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> to source potential <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> by way of a collector wiring <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, and the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for base <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> to the input terminal <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> by way of a base wiring <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and a gate wiring <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> By the method described herein above, the NPN bipolar transistor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> can suitably be fabricated. In addition, the base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and emitter <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are formed in the self-aligned manner with respect to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, this facilitates to determine appropriately the current amplification factor of the present transistor with the lateral bipolar transistor structure, and also to determine the width of the base as small as predetermined, through which most of the current flow exists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, by forming the base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and emitter <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> again in the self-aligned manner with respect to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, as mentioned above, the dispersion in alignment of the base width during photolithographic process steps can be made small enough to be disregarded. As a result, the NPN bipolar transistor with high-efficiency can be formed with a reduced ship area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> When the NPN bipolar transistor according to the present embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is turned off, a gate voltage at the gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, a base voltage at the base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and an emitter voltage at the emitter <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> becomes equal with each other, i.e., the ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> In the off-state of the transistor in a similar manner to that of DMOS (double-diffused metal-oxide transistor), a positive collector voltage (source voltage) is applied to the collector <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> (corresponding to the drain of the DMOS) by way of collector wiring <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and high concentration N-type ohmic diffusion layer for collector <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> As a result, a depleted region is created at an interface between the collector <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> (corresponding to the channel of DMOS), or in the interface region on the both sides of the collector <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, whereby high withstand voltages can be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is prepared to illustrate withstand voltage characteristics of the NPN bipolar transistor at off-state, which plots the collector current (A), vertically, versus the voltage between collector and emitter (V), horizontally, for the transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the collector current is as small as several hundreds of pA in the range between 0 to 30 V, which is indicative of being similar in the withstand voltage characteristics to those of the LDMOS transistor in off-state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the NPN bipolar transistor is turned on, a source voltage is applied to the base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> by way of the base wiring <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for base <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, and the source voltage is applied also to the gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> by way of the gate wiring <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> Although both source and channel are at the same potential in the DMOS, the potential difference between the base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and the emitter <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> in the NPN bipolar transistor becomes forward-biased, since the base and the emitter thereof correspond to the channel and the source of the DMOS, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> This results in the application of a positive potential to the base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. As a result, a high voltage does not appear at the gate electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> of the NPN transistor, which will be detailed herein below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the gate voltage V<highlight><subscript>G</subscript></highlight>, which is at the same potential as the base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, is maintained at a voltage ranging approximately from 0.8 to 0.9 V, without applying a high voltage at the gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. As a result, the breakdown of the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> can be prevented, whereby the operation characteristics of the bipolar transistor are stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> By enabling the current limiting feature with the power source for supplying to the base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and gate electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> in the bipolar transistor disclosed herein, the source and ground potentials are effectively utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> As a result, it becomes unnecessary to incorporate an additional device for lowering the source voltage such as, for example, an integrated stepdown circuit, which has been necessary for previous devices.

<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> With the above features of the present bipolar transistor, another effect can be noted over previous bipolar transistors, in that the current amplification factor is improved especially in the low current range. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> It may be added in this context, in the range of large collector currents I<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, the current amplification factor linearity characteristics for the NPN bipolar transistor have been obtained comparable with those of previously bipolar transistors. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> This can be achieved by comparing the reference voltage from the voltage reference circuit V ref with a feedback voltage from the dividing resistors, R <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, by means of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The junction between NPN bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> and ground terminal GND <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is connected to the ground potential <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> In addition, NPN bipolar transistors <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> are provided in order between the ground potential <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and output terminal <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The charge capacity negative terminal <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is connected between the NPN bipolar transistors <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> An oscillator OSC <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> is also provided to transmit two voltages by turns, one being the same voltage as that of the input terminal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (V in voltage) and the other the same as that of the ground terminal <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>(GND voltage), after comparing with the reference voltage output from a voltage reference circuit V ref <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0470" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0470&rsqb;</number> An output terminal of the oscillator OSC <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> is connected, to respective bases of NPN bipolar transistors <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> directly, to the gate electrode of NPN bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> by way of an inverter <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, and to the base of PNP bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> by way of inverters <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> This inverting type charge pump DC/DC converter operates so as to exert the switching operations of the four transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> by applying voltages from the oscillator <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to respective bases of these transistors, to generate the current by charging and discharging the capacitor connected between the charge capacity positive terminal <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> and the charge capacity negative terminal <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, and to output to the output terminal <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> the voltage generated by inverting the voltage input from the input terminal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0472" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0472&rsqb;</number> At least one of the bipolar transistors disclosed herein is thus used as the component transistors such as the PNP <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, and the NPN bipolar transistors, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, incorporated into the present voltage stabilizer. This facilitates to decrease the size of an output driver and miniaturize the chip area yet attaining high withstand voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0473" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0473&rsqb;</number> Upon transmitting the GND voltage from the oscillator OSC <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, the PNP bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and the NPN bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> are turned on, while the NPN bipolar transistors, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, are turned off. During this period, the charge is accumulated in the capacitor connected between the charge capacity positive terminal CP&plus; <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> and the charge capacity negative terminal CP&minus; <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0474" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0474&rsqb;</number> In contrast, on transmitting the V in voltage from the oscillator OSC <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, the PNP bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and the NPN bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> are turned off, while the NPN bipolar transistors, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, are turned on. The capacitor then dissipates the charge previously accumulated. Since the potential of the output terminal V out <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is kept lower than the ground terminal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a voltage is now obtained, which is inverted from the voltage generated by the previously accumulated charge, and then output to the output terminal <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0475" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0475&rsqb;</number> By repeating the above steps, therefore, the current flow can be maintained with the voltage inverted from the voltage input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0476" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0476&rsqb;</number> While the bipolar transistors disclosed herein are used as the components for forming the circuits such as the voltage stabilizer and DC/DC converter according to the embodiments in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</cross-reference>, the circuit is not limited to those described above, but may also be adapted to any circuits incorporating bipolar transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0477" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0477&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor device fabrication and process steps set forth in the present description may therefore be implemented using suitable host computers and terminals incorporating appropriate processors programmed according to the teachings disclosed herein, as will be appreciated to those skilled in the relevant arts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0478" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0478&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the present disclosure also includes a computer-based product which may be hosted on a storage medium and include instructions which can be used to program a processor to perform a process in accordance with the present disclosure. The storage medium can include, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMS, magneto-optical disks, ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMS, flash memory, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0479" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0479&rsqb;</number> It is apparent from the above description including the examples, the devices and methods disclosed herein have several advantages over similar devices and methods previously known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0480" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0480&rsqb;</number> Although these advantages are described earlier in this disclosure, they are summarized as follows with respect to the MOS structures disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0481" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0481&rsqb;</number> (1) Since the drain of the LDMOS transistor is formed in the drain well region, having a partial overlap with one of the sides of the gate electrode, an appropriate drain threshold and also low on resistance can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0482" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0482&rsqb;</number> (2) The LDMOS semiconductor is formed in a semiconductor substrate, including at least a medium concentration drain region having an impurity concentration smaller than that of a channel well region. As a result, an undue decrease in the effective channel length can be obviated, which may be caused during thermal diffusion process steps for forming both medium concentration drain region and channel well region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0483" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0483&rsqb;</number> (3) Two regions for forming the P-channel type LDMOS transistor and the P-channel type MOS transistor, respectively, are preferably formed simultaneously in an N-type isolation well region in the semiconductor substrate. Also, a P-type drain well region for forming the P-channel type LDMOS transistor and a P-type well region for forming a conventional N-channel type MOS transistor are formed simultaneously in the N-type isolation well region. As a result, process steps can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0484" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0484&rsqb;</number> (4) The semiconductor device incorporating N-type LDMOS transistor and a conventional P-channel type MOS transistor is fabricated, in which an N-type drain well region for forming the N-channel type LDMOS transistor and an N-type well region for forming the conventional P-channel type MOS transistor are formed simultaneously in P conductivity type substrate. As a result, process steps can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0485" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0485&rsqb;</number> (5) Although P conductivity type of semiconductor substrates are utilized for forming the above semiconductor devices, N conductivity type of substrates may alternatively be used to form semiconductor devices including components of the opposite conductivity type. As a result, process steps can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0486" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0486&rsqb;</number> (6) When both LDMOS transistor and conventional N-channel type MOS transistor are incorporated into the semiconductor device, the gate oxide layer formed contiguously under the LDMOS transistor has a thickness smaller than that of the conventional MOS transistor. This facilitates to decrease the on resistance for the LDMOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0487" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0487&rsqb;</number> (7) In the power source unit incorporating the LDMOS transistor disclosed herein, the area for output driver can be decreased because of reduced on resistance values of the transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0488" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0488&rsqb;</number> (8) In the charge pump type DC/DC converter incorporating the LDMOS transistor disclosed herein as at least one of the integrated switches, the chip area required for resistors in practical products can be decreased, since reduced on resistance values facilitate to increase current supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0489" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0489&rsqb;</number> (9) Since the drain of the LDMOS transistor is formed spatially separated from the gate electrode having a depth smaller than that of medium concentration drain region or channel well region, an appropriate drain threshold and also low on resistance can be obtained. Since the source is self-aligned with respect to the gate electrode, source resistance values can be reduced and transistor characteristics are stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0490" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0490&rsqb;</number> In addition, the medium concentration drain region is formed in the self-aligned manner with respect to the gate electrode. As a result, the drain resistance values can be reduced and transistor characteristics are stabilized. Furthermore, since the channel well region is formed in the self-aligned manner with respect to the gate electrode, transistor characteristics of the LDMOS transistor can be stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0491" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0491&rsqb;</number> (10) In the methods for fabricating the semiconductor device, the step of thermally diffusing impurity ions during the formation of the medium concentration drain region is carried out following ion implantation steps. This gives rise to an increase in the region of the medium concentration drain compared with the region formed without thermal diffusion, to thereby result in an increase in the number of ions possibly introduced in the region. As a result, the resistance of the medium concentration drain region can be decreased along with a decrease in drain resistance yet maintaining high withstand voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0492" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0492&rsqb;</number> (11) In the methods for fabricating the semiconductor device, the step of thermally diffusing impurity ions for forming the medium concentration drain region is carried out simultaneously with the step of thermally diffusing impurity ions for forming the channel well region. As a result, the medium concentration drain region can be increased without including any additional thermal diffusion step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0493" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0493&rsqb;</number> (12) Also, in the method for fabricating the semiconductor device, the number of impurity ions implanted for forming the channel well region is greater than that for forming the medium concentration drain region. As a result, an undue decrease in the effective channel length can be obviated, which may be caused during thermal diffusion process steps for forming both medium concentration drain region and channel well region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0494" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0494&rsqb;</number> (13) When both LDMOS and PchMOS transistors are incorporated into the semiconductor device, the P-type polysilicon gate electrode is made of polysilicon layer having a thickness of at least 500 nm and a concentration of the P-type impurity ions ranging from 2.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>to 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>, and thermal diffusion process steps following the ion implantation for forming the channel well region are carried out at a temperature ranging from 1050 to 1100&deg; C. for a period of time ranging from 100 to 500 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0495" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0495&rsqb;</number> As a result, the punch-through of P-type impurities through the gate oxide layer can be prevented, and the decrease in PchMOS withstand voltage values can be obviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0496" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0496&rsqb;</number> (14) The method for fabricating the semiconductor device may include a further step for forming the P-type polysilicon gate electrode by first forming a polysilicon layer without including impurity ions on the gate oxide, forming the silicon oxide layer on the polysilicon layer to a thickness ranging from 25 to 50 nm, and subsequently doping P-type impurity ions by implanting through the silicon oxide layer such that an impurity concentration in the polysilicon layer reach the above noted concentration ranging from 2.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>to 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0497" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0497&rsqb;</number> As a result, the punch-through of P-type ions through the gate oxide layer can be prevented and the impurity concentration in the resultant polysilicon gate electrode can be determined accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0498" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0498&rsqb;</number> Although several advantages are described earlier with respect to the bipolar transistors disclosed herein, they are summarized as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0499" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0499&rsqb;</number> (1) The bipolar transistor structure is further provided with the wiring for connecting the gate electrode with the base to be equipotential one another, to thereby be able to decrease the base width. In addition, since a forward-biased voltage results between the base and emitter, as indicated earlier, a high voltage does not appear at the gate electrode of the transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0500" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0500&rsqb;</number> As a result, the breakdown of the gate dielectric layer can be prevented even when a high voltage such as, for example, the source potential is applied, whereby stable operation characteristics are achieved for the bipolar transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0501" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0501&rsqb;</number> (2) The bipolar transistor structure is alternatively provided with the wiring for connecting the gate electrode with the emitter to be equipotential one another, to thereby be able to decrease the base width. In addition, since a forward-biased voltage results between the base and gate electrode, a forward-biased voltage is applied to the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0502" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0502&rsqb;</number> The breakdown of the gate dielectric layer, therefore, can be prevented even when a high voltage such as, for example, the source potential is applied, whereby stable operation characteristics are achieved for the bipolar transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0503" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0503&rsqb;</number> (3) The high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for collector and the gate electrode are preferably formed spatially separated one another in the transistor. This facilitates to suppress the gate modulation effect, and to further increase threshold voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0504" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0504&rsqb;</number> (4) During the formation of the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the collector and the gate electrode spatially separated one another, a medium concentration collector is further provided in the collector in intermediate between the gate electrode and the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting collector, which is made of a diffusion layer of the first conductivity type having an impurity concentration larger than the collector, and smaller than the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting collector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0505" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0505&rsqb;</number> As a result, a collector resistance between the high concentration ohmic diffusion layer for connecting the collector and gate electrode can be reduced, and the current amplification factor can be increased in the high current range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0506" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0506&rsqb;</number> (5) Since the bipolar transistor disclosed herein is utilized in the power source unit for outputting a constant voltage through voltage comparison and feedback operations, the area for output driver can be reduced yet maintaining high threshold voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0507" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0507&rsqb;</number> (6) Since the bipolar transistor disclosed herein is utilized as at least one of its internal switches in the charge pump type DC/DC converter capable of outputting a persistent current flow, the chip area required for resistors in practical products can be decreased yet maintaining high threshold voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0508" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0508&rsqb;</number> (7) In the methods for fabricating the bipolar transistor herein disclosed, the base and emitter are formed in the self-aligned manner with respect to the gate electrode. This facilitates to determine the current amplification factor of the transistor with the lateral bipolar transistor structure, and also the base width as small as predetermined, through which most of the current flow exists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0509" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0509&rsqb;</number> In addition, the dispersion in alignment of the base width during photolithographic process steps can be made small enough to be disregarded. The bipolar transistor with high-efficiency can therefore be formed with a reduced ship area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0510" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0510&rsqb;</number> (9) Also, in the methods for fabricating the bipolar transistor herein, the medium concentration collector is formed in the collector in the self-aligned manner with respect to the gate electrode on the other side of the gate electrode from the base. The position of the medium concentration collector is therefore determined by the edge of the gate electrode. As a result, the dispersion, in alignment during photolithographic process steps, of the distance between the medium concentration collector and the base can be made small enough to be disregarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0511" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0511&rsqb;</number> Obviously, additional modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0512" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0512&rsqb;</number> This document claims priority and contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Applications No. 2001-195380 and 2001-219446, filed with the Japanese Patent Office on Jun. 27, 2001 and Jul. 19, 2001, respectively, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
