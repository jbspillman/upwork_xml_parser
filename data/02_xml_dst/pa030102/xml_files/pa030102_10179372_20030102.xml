<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In an LED, when electric power is supplied to a blue light-emitting element through a pair of leads, light is emitted upward from an upper surface of the blue light-emitting element and, at the same time, light is radiated from side and lower surfaces of the blue light-emitting element so that a fluorescent substance is irradiated with the light. The latter light is reflected by a front surface of the fluorescent substance or by a concave reflecting mirror serving as a highly reflective material, so that the reflected light is radiated upward as excitation light (fluorescence) or as irradiation light. Because a radiating surface of a convex lens is formed above the concave reflecting mirror, the excitation light and irradiation light emitted thus are condensed by the convex lens and radiated externally with high external radiation efficiency. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-195961, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a light-emitting diode (hereinafter abbreviated to &ldquo;LED&rdquo;) in which a fluorescent material generates fluorescence when excited by light emitted from a light-emitting element. In this specification, an LED chip itself is called a &ldquo;light-emitting element&rdquo; and a light-emitting device including the LED chip mounted thereon, and an optical device such as a package resin or a lens system is called a &ldquo;light-emitting diode&rdquo; or an &ldquo;LED&rdquo; as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the related art, there is known a light-emitting diode in which a light-emitting element emitting blue light is covered with a fluorescent substance or a fluorescent substance-containing resin which generates yellow light when excited by the blue light emitted from the light-emitting element. In this light-emitting diode, the blue light emitted from the light-emitting element and the yellow light generated from the fluorescent substance excited by the blue light are mixed with each other, so that the mixed light viewed as white light can be radiated to the outside. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows such a specific example of the light-emitting diode. That is, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a longitudinal sectional view showing the overall configuration of the related-art light-emitting diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The light-emitting diode <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> has a blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, a pair of silver-plated leads <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for supplying electric power to the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and a cup <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>provided in an upper end portion of one <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the leads. The blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is mounted on a bottom surface of the cup <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Two electrodes on a surface of the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are bonded and electrically connected to the pair of leads <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by two wires <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>respectively. The cup <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is filled with a fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> so that the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is covered with the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. The fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> generates yellow light when excited by blue light. The blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, and so on, are sealed with a transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. At the same time, a radiating surface of a convex lens <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is molded of the transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, when blue light is radiated from the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, a part of the blue light directly passing through the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, and yellow light generated from the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> excited by the remaining blue light are mixed with each other in the transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The mixed light is radiated externally so as to be viewed as white light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The configuration is, however, inferior in the efficiency of externally radiating the blue light emitted from the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and the yellow light generated when the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is excited. That is, only a part of blue light transmitted through the layer of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is radiated to the outside. Because scattering of light occurs in the fluorescent substance layer <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, the average optical path to the outside is so long that absorption loss in the fluorescent substance layer <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> becomes large. Although a part of the scattered light in the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> enters the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> again, absorption loss in the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is, however, large because the refractive index of the material constituting the light-emitting element is so high that the light is hardly radiated externally and easily absorbed to the material of the light-emitting element. On the other hand, yellow excitation light is generated in the whole of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> when the blue light passes through the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. The quantity of the generated yellow excitation light is, however, large in the proximity of the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which is high in density of blue light. For this reason, absorption loss of the yellow light is large in the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and in the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> like absorption loss of the blue light. As described above, in a structure in which light emitted from the light-emitting element and transmitted through the fluorescent substance layer, and light generated by excitation of the fluorescent substance layer are radiated externally, there is a problem that absorption loss is large. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to provide a light-emitting diode in which the efficiency of externally radiating both light emitted from a light-emitting element and light generated by excitation (fluorescence) can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (1) According to the invention, there is provided a light-emitting diode including: a light-emitting element; and a fluorescent face made of a fluorescent substance containing at least one of inorganic or organic fluorescent materials, the fluorescent substance being formed by application on a highly reflective material; wherein light is extracted externally from a side of the fluorescent face irradiated with light emitted from the light-emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the LED configured as described above, light emitted from the light-emitting element is radiated externally after the light is reflected by a front or rear surface of the fluorescent face. Generally, both reflection of the light emitted from the light-emitting element for performing irradiation (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;irradiation light&rdquo;), and generation of fluorescence caused by excitation of the fluorescent material (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;excitation light&rdquo;) occur most frequently in the front surface of the fluorescent face and its vicinity, the excitation of the fluorescent material being carried out when the light emitted from the light-emitting element is absorbed to the fluorescent material. Therefore, the irradiation light reflected by the front surface of the fluorescent face and the excitation light can be radiated to the outside efficiently without being absorbed to the fluorescent substance. On the other hand, a part of light reflected by the highly reflective material after the light hits the rear surface of the fluorescent face passes through the fluorescent material while the light makes a reciprocating motion in the fluorescent material. Therefore, a large part of the excitation light is mixed with the part of the irradiation light, so that the mixed light is radiated externally. In this manner, the light reflected by the front surface of the fluorescent face and the light reflected by the rear surface of the fluorescent face are combined with each other. Hence, the external radiation efficiency is improved greatly compared with the related art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, light emitted from the light-emitting element is radiated externally after the light is reflected by the front or rear surface of the fluorescent face. As a result, there can be provided a light-emitting diode enhanced in the efficiency in externally radiating both light emitted from the light-emitting element and excitation light (fluorescence). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (2) According to the invention, there is provided a light-emitting diode having the configuration defined in (1), wherein the fluorescent face formed on the highly reflective material is disposed to surround side surfaces of the light-emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When the fluorescent face formed on the highly reflective material is provided to surround the side surfaces of the light-emitting element as described above, light emitted from the side surfaces of the light-emitting element can be also reflected by the fluorescent face so as to be radiated externally as excitation light and irradiation light. Hence, the external radiation efficiency can be improved more greatly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (3) According to the invention, there is provided a light-emitting diode having the configuration defined in (1) or (2), wherein the fluorescent face is provided opposite to the light-emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the LED configured as described above, a large part of light emitted from a light-emitting surface of the light-emitting element is reflected by the fluorescent face. Hence, the quantity of light reflected by the front and rear surfaces of the fluorescent face is increased remarkably. The light is radiated externally as excitation light and irradiation light. Hence, the external radiation efficiency can be improved greatly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When the fluorescent face formed on the highly reflective material is provided opposite to the light-emitting element as described above, there can be provided a light-emitting diode greatly improved in the efficiency of externally radiating the excitation light and the irradiation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (4) According to the invention, there is provided a light-emitting diode having the configuration defined in any of (1) through (3), wherein the fluorescent face is formed in a paraboloid of revolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (5) According to the invention, there is provided a light-emitting diode having the configuration defined in any one of (1) to (3), wherein the light-emitting element emits ultraviolet light for performing irradiation; and the fluorescent substance is made of at least one of inorganic and organic fluorescent materials and formed by applying the at least one fluorescent material on the highly reflective material so that the fluorescent material emits light when irradiated with the ultraviolet light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Fluorescent materials emitting light when irradiated with ultraviolet light may generate fluorescence in various colors. Hence, light in any color selected from various colors can be radiated externally from the fluorescent face. Moreover, there is no fear that the problem in color separation between irradiation light and excitation light occurs because irradiation with ultraviolet light invisible to human eyes is used for generating fluorescence. Further, among fluorescent materials which emit light when irradiated with ultraviolet light, some fluorescent materials emit light intensively in the three primary colors, that is, red, green and blue. Hence, when these fluorescent materials are mixed in optimal mixture proportions to form a fluorescent substance, an LED emitting bright white light can be fabricated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In this manner, when a light-emitting element emitting ultraviolet light is combined with fluorescent materials emitting light when irradiated with such ultraviolet light, a light-emitting diode emitting light in a color selected from various colors can be fabricated without causing any problem in color separation and, further, a light-emitting diode emitting bright white light can be fabricated.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> First, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, Embodiment 1 of the invention will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a longitudinal sectional view showing the overall configuration of a light-emitting diode according to Embodiment 1 of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a longitudinal sectional view showing the overall configuration of a modified example of the light-emitting diode according to Embodiment 1 of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an LED <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to Embodiment 1 has a blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a pair of silver-plated leads <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for supplying electric power to the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>provided in an upper end portion of one <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the leads, and a fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> containing a fluorescent material and applied on a concave surface of the concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to have a uniform thickness. The blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is mounted on a bottom portion of the concave surface of the concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>through transparent paste. The blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is bonded and electrically connected to the pair of leads <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>respectively. The blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, forward end portions of the pair of leads <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the wires <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are sealed with a transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. At the same time, a radiating surface of a convex lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is molded of the transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the LED <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> configured as described above, when electric power is supplied to the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the pair of leads <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, light is emitted upward from an upper surface of the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, light is radiated also from side and lower surfaces of the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is irradiated with the light radiated from the side and lower surfaces. Both reflection of light emitted from the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for performing irradiation, and generation of fluorescence caused by excitation of the fluorescent material occur most frequently in surfaces of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and their vicinity, the excitation of the fluorescent material being carried out when the light emitted from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is absorbed into the fluorescent material. Accordingly, blue light and yellow light reflected by these surfaces are radiated upward without being absorbed to the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Because the radiating surface of the convex lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed above the concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the blue light and yellow light emitted thus are mixed with each other in the transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so as to be condensed as white light and radiated externally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, yellow excitation light is generated over the whole optical path of the blue light, until the blue light returns to the surfaces of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> after the blue light passes through the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and is reflected by the concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>serving as a highly reflective material. Absorption loss in the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is, however, reduced because of the presence of the concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as a highly reflective material. The blue light and a considerable part of yellow light can be radiated upward from the inside of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. On this occasion, light reflected by the concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>serving as a highly reflective material passes through the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> while the light makes a reciprocating motion in the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the thickness of the fluorescent substance can be reduced to a half of the thickness required in a related-art transmission type LED. Hence, a large part of excitation light and a part of irradiation light are mixed with each other, so that the mixed light is radiated externally. In addition, because the light passes through the fluorescent material while the light makes a reciprocating motion in the fluorescent material, the coating thickness of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at the time of the formation of the fluorescent face can be reduced to thereby attain reduction in cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, this embodiment is different from the related-art example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that a large part of blue light emitted from the upper surface of the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is condensed directly by the convex lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and then radiated externally without being transmitted through the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In addition, as for the blue light emitted from the side and lower surfaces of the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and hitting the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, both reflection of the blue light and generation of yellow light by excitation of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> absorbing the blue light occur most frequently in surfaces of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and their vicinity. The blue light and the yellow light reflected by the surfaces of the fluorescent substance are radiated upward without being absorbed to the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so as to be condensed by the convex lens <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and then radiated externally. In addition, the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> generates yellow light when excited by the blue light entering the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Some part of the yellow light is scattered so as to go out of the surfaces of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. That is, a part of the yellow light reaches the concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>serving as a highly reflective material and is then absorbed to the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> while the light is reflected by the concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and passes through the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the other part of the yellow light reaches the surfaces of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and is radiated externally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the LED <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to Embodiment 1, light emitted from the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is reflected by the front surface or the rear surface (concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. When the reflected light to be radiated externally is combined, the efficiency of externally radiating both the blue light emitted from the light-emitting element and the excitation light (yellow light) can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> modified example of Embodiment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described below. Incidentally, parts the same as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are referenced correspondingly and the description of these parts will be omitted. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an LED <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as a modified example of Embodiment 1 is different from the LED <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in that a diffusing agent <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> mixed with the transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disposed above the concave reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. As a result, irradiation light emitted from the blue light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and yellow light generated from the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> excited by the irradiation light are diffused by the diffusing agent <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so as to be mixed with each other well. Hence, it is possible to greatly reduce the phenomenon of color separation in which blue light and yellow light are not mixed with each other as white light but separated from each other individually as they are. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, in the LED <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a modified example of Embodiment 1, when the diffusing agent <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is mixed in the transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the radiation light and the excitation light are mixed with each other well so that the phenomenon of color separation is reduced greatly with the result that light in a desired color can be radiated externally. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, Embodiment 2 of the invention will be described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a longitudinal sectional view showing the overall configuration of a light-emitting diode according to Embodiment 2 of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a longitudinal sectional view showing the overall configuration of a modified example of the light-emitting diode according to Embodiment 2 of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in an LED <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> according to Embodiment 2, a light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is mounted on a disk-like white substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (corresponding to reflecting substrate) provided with a circuit pattern formed thereon. A donut-like white reflecting frame <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> disposed to surround the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fixed on the white substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> containing a fluorescent material is applied on the whole surfaces of the white substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the white reflecting frame <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which surround the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, a fluorescent face having a uniform thickness is formed. A hollow portion provided in the inside of the fluorescent face is filled with a transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. At the same time, a radiating surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed as an upper surface of the resin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Of light emitted from the upper surface of the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, some part passes through the transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and then radiated directly to the outside from the radiating surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, while the other part hits the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in a side surface portion of the fluorescent face and is reflected by the front surface of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or reflected by the white reflecting frame <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> disposed as a highly reflective material on the rear surface of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The other part reflected thus excites the fluorescent material to be converted into excitation light and radiated from the radiating surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In this LED <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, light is converted into excitation light at a high rate because the fluorescent face makes a large solid angle with respect to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Further, light reflected by an interface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> between the epoxy resin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having a refractive index n&equals;1.5 and air having a refractive index n&equals;1.0 reaches the fluorescent face again, so that the light is converted into excitation light and then radiated. On the other hand, light emitted from the side surface of the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> hits the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the side or bottom surface of the fluorescent face. The light excites the fluorescent material to generate light as excitation light. The excitation light is moved upward while reflected between portions of the fluorescent face. Finally, the light is radiated externally from the radiating surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the LED <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> according to Embodiment 2, the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is applied on both the white substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the white reflecting frame <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which serve as highly reflective materials to thereby form a fluorescent face. Irradiation light emitted from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and excitation light generated from the fluorescent material excited by a part of the irradiation light reflected by the front and rear surfaces of the fluorescent face are mixed with each other, so that the mixed light is radiated externally from the radiating surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> provided as an upper surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> modified example of Embodiment 2 will be described below. Incidentally, parts the same as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are referenced correspondingly and the description of these parts will be omitted. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an LED <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as a modified example of Embodiment 2 is different from the LED <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in that the cylindrical filler portion made of the transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is cut into a conical shape on the radiating surface side. As a result, the radiating surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is shaped like a convex cone. Hence, all light directly radiated from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the radiating surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is reflected by the radiating surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> so that the fluorescent face around the transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is irradiated with the reflected light. Hence, all light emitted from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> irradiates the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> only once. As a result, all light radiated externally from the radiating surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is a uniform mixture of irradiation light and excitation light. The LED can be produced as an LED free from color separation. </paragraph>

An upper surface of a white reflecting substrate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is shaped like a paraboloid of revolution with the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as its focal point so that the upper surface of the white reflecting substrate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is disposed opposite to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is applied on the paraboloid of revolution to thereby form a fluorescent face having a uniform thickness. A hollow portion between the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is filled with a transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. With this configuration, in the LED <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, almost all light emitted from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is radiated onto the fluorescent face. On this occasion, light emitted from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is not radiated to the outside directly but is always radiated to the outside after the light hits the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> once. In addition, because the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed on the white reflecting substrate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is a highly reflective material, the thickness of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be reduced to a half of the thickness required in the related-art transmission type LED. </paragraph>

The metal plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of aluminum is shaped like a paraboloid of revolution with the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as its focal point in the same manner as in Embodiment 3. A fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> containing a fluorescent material is applied on an upper surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to thereby form a fluorescent face having a uniform thickness.

A space following the silver thin film <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is filled with a transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the LED <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> fabricated thus, the silver thin film <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> disposed as a highly reflective material opposite to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is shaped like a paraboloid of revolution. A fluorescent face made of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is formed on the silver thin film <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The fluorescent face is wholly sealed with the transparent epoxy resins <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. At the same time, a radiating surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is formed as an upper surface. As a result, the LED <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> has a similar configuration to the LED <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> according to Embodiment 4. Hence, almost the whole part of light emitted from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is radiated onto the fluorescent face. On this occasion, light emitted from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is not radiated to the outside directly but is always radiated to the outside after the light hits the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> once.

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in an LED <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> according to Embodiment 5, a metal plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is disposed as a highly reflective material opposite to the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> mounted on a lower surface of a white substrate <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The metal plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is shaped like a paraboloid of revolution with the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as its focal point. A fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> containing a fluorescent material is applied on an upper surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to thereby form a fluorescent face having a uniform thickness. The light-emitting element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, a forward end portion of the white substrate <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, the metal plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are sealed with a transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. At the same time, a radiating surface <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> formed as an upward convex lens is made of the transparent epoxy resin <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, almost the whole part of light emitted from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is reflected by the fluorescent face and moves upward in a state in which irradiation light and excitation light are mixed with each other. On this occasion, light emitted from the light-emitting element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is not radiated to the outside directly but is always radiated after the light hits the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> once. In addition, because the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is formed on the metal plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which is a highly reflective material, the thickness of the fluorescent substance <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> can be reduced to a half of the thickness required in the related-art transmission type LED. Then, the light is condensed by the radiating surface <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of the convex lens and radiated externally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, in the LED <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> according to Embodiment 5, all reflected light is radiated in one direction in a state in which irradiation light and excitation light are mixed with each other. Hence, there is no fear of occurrence of the problem in color separation. Moreover, external radiation efficiency is enhanced so that the quantity of light can be increased. In addition, because the radiating surface <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of the convex lens is provided, light can be condensed by the radiating surface <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and radiated externally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the respective embodiments, the surface of the fluorescent substance on the highly reflective material has a large solid angle with respect to the light-emitting element. Therefore, most of light emitted by the light-emitting element can be covered for wavelength conversion within the fluorescent substance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The respective embodiments have been described upon the case where a light-emitting element emitting visible light is used in combination with a fluorescent substance containing a fluorescent material which generates fluorescence as visible light when excited by the visible light. As an example of the case, a combination of a blue light-emitting element and a fluorescent material generating yellow fluorescence when irradiated with blue light emitted from the blue light-emitting element has been described. The invention may be applied also to the case where a light-emitting element emitting ultraviolet light is used in combination with a fluorescent substance which contains a fluorescent material and which generates fluorescent as visible light when excited by irradiation with the ultraviolet light. Some fluorescent materials generating light when irradiated with ultraviolet light generate fluorescence in various colors. Accordingly, light in a color selected from various colors can be radiated externally from the fluorescent face. In this case, there is no fear of occurrence of the problem in color separation between irradiation light and excitation light because the fluorescent material is irradiated with ultraviolet light invisible to human eyes to thereby generate fluorescence. In addition, some fluorescent materials generating fluorescence by irradiation with the ultraviolet light can intensively generate light in three primary colors, that is, red, green and blue. Hence, when these fluorescent materials are mixed in optimal mixture proportions to forma fluorescent substance, an LED emitting bright white light can be fabricated. Incidentally, in this case, the lead frames, the metal plate and the thin film need to be made of aluminum exhibiting high reflectance even in the ultraviolet region because silver exhibits low reflectance in the ultraviolet region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Although the respective embodiments have been described upon the case where a transparent epoxy resin is used as a sealing material, any sealing material may be used if it can satisfy conditions such as fluidity and filling characteristic before curing, and transparency and strength after curing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Although the respective embodiments have been described upon the case where the light-emitting element and the fluorescent substance are sealed with a resin, the invention may be applied also to the case where they are not sealed with a resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The configuration, shape, quantity, material, size and connection relation of the other portions in the light-emitting diode are not limited to the respective embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the invention, there is provided a light-emitting diode including: a light-emitting element; and a fluorescent face made of a fluorescent substance containing at least one of inorganic or organic fluorescent materials, the fluorescent substance being formed by application on a highly reflective material; wherein light is extracted externally from a side of the fluorescent face irradiated with light emitted from the light-emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the LED configured as described above, light emitted from the light-emitting element is radiated externally after the light is reflected by a front or rear surface of the fluorescent face. Generally, both reflection of the light emitted from the light-emitting element for performing irradiation, and generation of fluorescence caused by excitation of the fluorescent material occur most frequently in the front surface of the fluorescent face and its vicinity, the excitation of the fluorescent material being carried out when the light emitted from the light-emitting element is absorbed to the fluorescent material. Therefore, the irradiation light reflected by the front surface of the fluorescent face and the excitation light can be radiated to the outside efficiently without being absorbed to the fluorescent substance. On the other hand, a part of light reflected by the highly reflective material after the light hits the rear surface of the fluorescent face passes through the fluorescent material while the light makes a reciprocating motion in the fluorescent material. Therefore, a large part of the excitation light is mixed with the part of the irradiation light, so that the mixed light is radiated externally. In this manner, the light reflected by the front surface of the fluorescent face and the light reflected by the rear surface of the fluorescent face are combined with each other. Hence, the external radiation efficiency is improved greatly compared with the related art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, light emitted from the light-emitting element is radiated externally after the light is reflected by the front or rear surface of the fluorescent face. As a result, there can be provided a light-emitting diode enhanced in the efficiency in externally radiating both light emitted from the light-emitting element and excitation light (fluorescence). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the fluorescent face formed on the highly reflective material may be disposed to surround side surfaces of the light-emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When the fluorescent face formed on the highly reflective material is provided to surround the side surfaces of the light-emitting element as described above, light emitted from the side surfaces of the light-emitting element can be also reflected by the fluorescent face so as to be radiated externally as excitation light and irradiation light. Hence, the external radiation efficiency can be improved more greatly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the fluorescent face may be provided opposite to the light-emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the LED configured as described above, a large part of light emitted from a light-emitting surface of the light-emitting element is reflected by the fluorescent face. Hence, the quantity of light reflected by the front and rear surfaces of the fluorescent face is increased remarkably. The light is radiated externally as excitation light and irradiation light. Hence, the external radiation efficiency can be improved greatly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> When the fluorescent face formed on the highly reflective material is provided opposite to the light-emitting element as described above, there can be provided a light-emitting diode greatly improved in the efficiency of externally radiating the excitation light and the irradiation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, there is provided a light-emitting diode having a configuration as described above, wherein the light-emitting element emits ultraviolet light for performing irradiation; and the fluorescent substance is made of at least one of inorganic or organic fluorescent materials and formed by applying the at least one fluorescent material on the highly reflective material so that the fluorescent material emits light when irradiated with the ultraviolet light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Fluorescent materials emitting light when irradiated with ultraviolet light may generate fluorescence in various colors. Hence, light in any color selected from various colors can be radiated externally from the fluorescent face. Moreover, there is no fear that the problem in color separation between irradiation light and excitation light occurs because irradiation with ultraviolet light invisible to human eyes is used for generating fluorescence. Further, among fluorescent materials which emit light when irradiated with ultraviolet light, some fluorescent materials emit light intensively in the three primary colors, that is, red, green and blue. Hence, when these fluorescent materials are mixed in optimal mixture proportions to form a fluorescent substance, an LED emitting bright white light can be fabricated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In this manner, when a light-emitting element emitting ultraviolet light is combined with fluorescent materials emitting light when irradiated with such ultraviolet light, a light-emitting diode emitting light in a color selected from various colors can be fabricated without causing any problem in color separation and, further, a light-emitting diode emitting bright white light can be fabricated. </paragraph>
