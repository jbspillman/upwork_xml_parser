<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an image obtaining method and apparatus for an endoscope, and in particular to an image obtaining method and apparatus, which employs a solid state image obtaining element having charge multiplying type shift resistor utilizing an impact ionization phenomenon, for an endoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, the noise component included in an image signal obtained by the read out of a signal charge from a solid state image obtaining element such as a CCD or the like is formed of read noise and dark noise. In a case, for example, wherein, utilizing an endoscope, a living tissue (hereinafter referred to as a target subject) within a body cavity is to be observed as a motion picture at a frame rate of 60 frames/second, an image formed of extremely weak light is detected by a solid state image obtaining element and obtained thereby as a signal charge, and the observation image signal formed based on the image signal obtained by the read out of the aforementioned signal charge from the solid state image obtaining element is used as the aforementioned motion picture that is to be observed; however, there are cases in which the aforementioned noise component deteriorates the quality of the observation image signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, charge multiplying type solid state image obtaining elements utilizing an impact ionization phenomenon to amplify the charge (hereinafter referred to as charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining elements) have been developed. It is known that if a charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element is used, the photoelectrically converted signal charge can be amplified without incurring an increase in the read noise. Investigations as to whether or not the read noise can be reduced and the S/N ratio of the obtained image signal can be improved by utilizing an endoscope provided with a charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element in the obtainment of the motion picture of the target subject within a body cavity by use of, are progressing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Note that the charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element is an image obtaining element provided with a shift resistor having a charge multiplying function, which is disposed between the horizontal readout resistor of a CCD and a output amplifier; the photoelectrically converted signal charge is amplified by the impact ionization effect occurring within the aforementioned shift resistor. The principle by which the shift resistor provided with a charge multiplying function multiplies the signal charge employs an impact ionization phenomenon (the phenomenon whereby positive holes are formed when electrons collide with the silicon elements forming the shift resistor), wherein secondary electrons are produced when a signal charge is transmitted into a deep potential formed by an ample intensity. By transmitting, by use of multi-step shift resistors each of which have a deep potential, the signal charge that has been transmitted from the horizontal shift resistor, the aforementioned two-dimensional electrons can be produced repeatedly, and the signal charge can be amplified without incurring an amplification of the read noise. A detailed description of this type of charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element may be found in the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 5,337,340. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element described above exhibits the same performance characteristics with respect to dark noise as the conventional solid state image obtaining element, and if configured so as to suppress the generation of read noise, the problem of the dark noise included in the image signal obtained by the read out of the signal charge obtained by the charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element becomes conspicuous. In particular, with regard to an endoscope apparatus that is required to have a performance level enabling the accurate observation of an image formed of extremely faint light composed of a few photons such as is the case in which the fluorescent light emitted from a target subject within a body cavity is obtained as an image, it is even more desirable that the dark noise that becomes mixed with the observation image signal is suppressed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been developed in consideration of the forgoing circumstances, and it is an objective of the present invention to provide an image obtaining method and apparatus for an endoscope, wherein the S/N ratio of an observation image signal formed from the image signal obtained by a charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element can be improved in comparison to the S/N ratio of an observation image signal formed from the image signal obtained by a conventional solid state image obtaining elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The image obtaining method, which is for application in an endoscope, according to the present invention comprises performing the steps of: obtaining, by use of a charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element, an image formed of the light emitted or reflected from a target subject upon the irradiation thereof by a light, and a signal charge representing the obtained image; reading out, by use of a readout means, said signal charge and outputting an image signal based on the read out signal charge; and obtaining an observation image signal based on the outputted image signal; wherein, the dark noise image signal component representing the dark noise included within the image signal read out by the readout means is subtracted from said image signal to obtain the observation image signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The image obtaining apparatus according to the present invention comprises: an illuminating means for projecting a light onto a target subject; a charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element for obtaining an image formed of the light emitted or reflected from a target subject upon the irradiation thereof by the aforementioned light, and a signal charge representing the obtained image; and a readout means for reading out said signal charge from the charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element and outputting an image signal based on the read out signal charge; further comprising a subtracting means for subtracting the dark noise image signal component representing the dark noise included within the image signal read out by the readout means from said image signal to obtain a subtraction image signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The dark noise image signal component may be the image signal read out from the charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element by the readout means when the light is not being emitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The dark noise image signal component may be obtained in advance and prerecorded in the subtraction means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The image obtaining apparatus for an endoscope may further comprise an addition averaging means for adding and averaging (hereinafter referred to as addition averaging) a plurality of subtraction image signals successively outputted from the subtraction means to obtain an addition averaged subtraction image signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The readout means can be a readout means that reads out the signal charge at a frame rate greater than 60 frames/sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The expression &ldquo;light emitted from the target subject&rdquo; refers to the autofluorescence light or the like emitted from the target subject upon the irradiation thereof by a light having a wavelength on the shorter wavelength side of the visible wavelength range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The referents of &ldquo;light reflected from the target subject&rdquo; include, the light reflected from the target subject upon the irradiation thereof by a reference light referred to in order to determine the intensity of the light projected onto the target subject such as a near-infrared light, the light reflected from the target subject upon the irradiation thereof by an observation light for performing standard observation such as white light, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The referents of &ldquo;observation image signal&rdquo; include the signal representing a visible rendition of the target subject, a signal representing the results of an analysis of an image signal, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the image obtaining method and apparatus of the present invention: in obtaining an observation image signal based on the obtainment of an image of the target subject by the charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element, because the dark noise image signal component representing the dark noise included in the image signal read out by the readout means has been subtracted from said read out image signal to obtain a subtraction image based upon which the observation image signal is formed, the quantity of dark noise contained in the subtraction image is reduced, and the S/N ratio of the observation image signal formed based on said subtraction image can be improved in comparison to that obtained by conventional means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further, if the dark noise image signal component is the image signal read out from the charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element by the readout means when the light is not being emitted, and is obtained in advance and prerecorded in the subtraction means, the dark noise image signal component can be more accurately subtracted from the image signal, and the S/N ratio of the observation image signal formed based on said subtraction image can be improved in comparison to that obtained by conventional means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Still further, if an addition averaging means for adding and averaging a plurality of subtraction image signals successively outputted from the subtraction means to obtain an addition averaged subtraction image is provided, the margin of error of the dark noise image signal component can be averaged, and the S/N ratio of the observation image signal formed based on said subtraction image can be improved in comparison to that obtained by conventional means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In addition, if the readout means is a readout means that reads out the signal charge at a frame rate greater than 60 frames/sec, the signal charge can be read out at a faster speed than that read out from a charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element at the conventional 60 frames/sec frame rate, and the quantity of the dark noise component included in the image signal obtained by reading out the aforementioned signal charge can be reduced in comparison to that obtained by conventional means. This is due to the fact that as the signal charge readout speed of a solid state image obtaining element (i.e., conventional solid state image obtaining elements and charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining elements generally available on the consumer market) becomes faster, the quantity of dark noise accumulated thereon is reduced.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The illuminating means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises: a light source apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provided with a Gallium nitride type pulse drive semiconductor laser (GaN-LD) for projecting a first light, which is a pulse type excitation light of a wavelength near 410 nm, onto the target subject <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to cause the emission of fluorescent light therefrom, and a pulse drive laser for projecting a second light, which is a pulse type infrared light that serves as a reference light, onto the target subject <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; and a light guide <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for guiding the excitation light and the near infrared light emitted from the light source apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the distal end portion G of the endoscope. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the above-described embodiment will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The pulse type excitation light emitted from the light source apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> passes through the light guide <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is projected onto the target subject <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As shown in the timing chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fluorescent light emitted from the target subject <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> upon the irradiation thereof by the pulse type excitation light P passes through the fluorescent light focusing lens <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and is focused onto the light detecting surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the charge multiplying shift resistor equipped solid state image obtaining element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as a DZS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). Note that an excitation light cutoff filter <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is disposed between the focusing lens <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the light detecting surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>; wherein, the excitation light directed toward the light detecting surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> together with the fluorescent light is cutoff by said excitation light cutoff filter <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The DZS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> detects the fluorescent image focused on the light detecting surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and obtains a signal charge representing said fluorescent image. The fluorescent image signal charge obtained by the DZS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is read out by the readout means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at a frame rate of 120 frames/sec, converted to a fluorescent image signal formed of digital values, outputted, and recorded in the subtraction means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Note that the frame rate at which the aforementioned signal charge is read out is represented by a value 1/(image exposure time&plus;readout time of the exposed image). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Continuing, as shown in the timing chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an image of the target subject <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> not irradiated by the excitation light is obtained by the DZS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while the excitation light is not being emitted, that is, the dark noise signal charge component is obtained {fraction (1/120)} seconds after the fluorescent image is obtained. The dark noise image signal charge obtained by the DZS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is read out by the readout means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the same frame rate of 120 frames/sec, converted to a dark noise image signal component representing the dark noise, outputted, and recorded in the subtraction means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Here, the readout time of the reading out of the signal charge from the DZS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the readout means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in the timing chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the readout time K of the fluorescent image signal charge obtained by the DZS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the readout time D of the dark noise signal charge component representing an image of the target subject <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> obtained by the DZS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when said target subject <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not being irradiated by the excitation light are both set at {fraction (1/120)} seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The subtraction means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, in which the fluorescent image signal and the dark noise image signal component have been recorded, subtracts the dark noise image signal component from the fluorescent image signal to obtain a subtraction image signal, and outputs said subtraction image signal. The subtraction image signal, which is an observation image signal, outputted from the subtracting means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is converted to a visible image signal and displayed on the display <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> at a frame rate of 60 frames/sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Note that because the obtainment by the DZS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the image when the excitation light is not being emitted from the light source apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as described above is performed within the body cavity of the patient, the dark noise signal charge component obtained by the DZS <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as the signal charge that represents dark noise, generated when the external light is shielded. </paragraph>
