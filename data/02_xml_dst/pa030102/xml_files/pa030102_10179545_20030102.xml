<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to computer systems and methods for trading, which expression includes brokerage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a continuous double auction marketplace, for a given item sellers provide offer prices and buyers provide bid prices for a given item. The item may be a physical item or a service. As is well known economic theory, if there is an excess supply, the equilibrium price (P<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>), at which supply and demand curves intersect, falls, while if there is an excess demand P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>rises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, in a fluid marketplace there is always a delay, which can vary enormously, between the change in supply and demand altering P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and the current trading price for the item (P<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>) reaching P<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention aim to provide an improved computer system and method for trading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention in a first aspect there is provided a computer system for trading, the system comprising a trading locale for establishing a marketplace, a bid receiver, an offer receiver, a current trading price monitor, an equilibrium price calculator for determining whether there is a difference between the equilibrium price and current trading price and a trading unit for selling if the equilibrium price is less than the current price or for buying of the equilibrium price is greater than the current price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Suitably, the equilibrium price calculator calculates the equilibrium price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Suitably, the trading unit is activated only if the difference between the equilibrium price and the current trading price is greater than a predetermined amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention in a second aspect, there is provided a trading method comprising establishing a marketplace, receiving bids and offers, determining whether an equilibrium price differs from a current trading price, selling if the equilibrium prices is less than the current trading price or buying if the equilibrium price is greater than the current trading price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Suitably, the trading method comprises the additional step of calculating the equilibrium price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Suitably, in the trading method the buying or selling takes place only if the difference between the equilibrium price and the current trading price is greater than a predetermined amount.</paragraph>

<brief-description-of-drawings>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the drawings that follow; in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a systematic functional diagram of a computer system according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a more detailed view of the computer system in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> are graphical representations of the supply and demand curves in a continuous double auction marketplace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a functional flow diagram illustrating operation of an embodiment of the present invention.</paragraph>
</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings that follow there is shown a computer system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> configured to receive bids to purchase items from buyers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and offers for sale from sellers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Typically the computer system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the buyers and sellers across a distributed electronic network such as the internet, a wide area network or local area network. Each buyer and seller comprises an entity communicating with the computer system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a computer node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Although a limited number of buyers and sellers are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> it will be appreciated that a multiplicity of buyers and a multiplicity of sellers may be involved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Computer system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> establishes a continuous double auction marketplace for the buying and selling of items. That is a locale is provided at which buyers and sellers can trade on a double auction basis. These items may be property, e.g. physical property, land, stocks, shares etc or services to be traded between buyers and sellers. The owner of the marketplace acts as a broker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of the drawings that follow, the computer system is described in terms of functional units and is shown to comprise a bid receiver <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an offer receiver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an equilibrium price calculator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> a current trading price determiner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a trading unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Bid receiver <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives purchase offer bids from buyers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Offer receiver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receives sale offers from sellers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Equilibrium price calculator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> determines the equilibrium price based on received bids and offers via the bid receiver <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and offer receiver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> By way of example, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the drawings that follow, to take a simplistic example <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is a graph representing, on the Y axis price and on the X axis quantity of items in relation to buy offers received. The graph shows the case in which three buy offers have been received as follows: buy 3 at 1.00, buy 1 at 1.10 and buy 2 at 0.95. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is referred to as the &ldquo;demand curve&rdquo; (with sufficient bids the stepped graph becomes graphically a smoother curve but for simplicity is represented here with only three bids). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B, a</cross-reference> &ldquo;supply curve&rdquo; is shown with price on the Y axis and quantity on the X axis for the following sell offers: sell 4 at 1.00, sell 1 at 1.30, sell 1 at 1.20, sell 2 at 1.10 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The price at which the demand curve and supply curve intersect (here 1.00) determines, according to economic theory, the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>at which the item should be traded which is determined in real time by the equilibrium price calculator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Typically the equilibrium price calculator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will comprise a maths processor for calculating the equilibrium price as quickly as possible dependent upon received bids and offers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Current trading price determiner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> monitors the current price in the market at which an item is being sold. This is determined by observation of the trades being made between the buyers and sellers in the marketplace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Trading unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> receives the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and the current price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>from equilibrium price calculator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and current price monitor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, respectively. Trading unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> then sells units into the marketplace i.e. offering items for a price below the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>if the equilibrium price is below P<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>. The trading unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> offers units for sale at a price between the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>and the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, generally as little below the current trading price as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the case in which the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is greater than the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>the trading unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> purchases units by making bids above the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>. The bids will be between the current trading price and the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and, preferably, as little above the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Bids, and offers, both from third parties and the trading unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, are made privately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By the computer system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> selling or buying as appropriate depends on the difference between the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>and equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, the current trading price tends towards the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>faster than in the existing markets and as such communicates this information more rapidly to the buyers and sellers (and potential buyers and sellers) monitoring the marketplace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further, it is possible for the owner of the computer system to provide the marketplace on a commission free basis to participants (buyers and sellers) because the owner of the market can, based on its knowledge of the sale offers and purchase bids buy and sell items ahead of the market fluctuations to obtain income therefrom. Other participants (or potential participants) in the marketplace may be monitoring the prices in the marketplace but can only respond to price fluctuations, not to bid and offer information as can the computer system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of the drawings that follow the method of trading of the present embodiment is described in more detail by a functional flow diagram. The steps referred to in the diagram need not be sequential in the order described. In practice all of the operations will occur substantially simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> bids for purchases are submitted by potential buyers to the marketplace indicated schematically at <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> established by the system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> offers for sale are submitted by potential sellers to the marketplace <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> established by the system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>Of the marketplace <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is monitored as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>of the marketplace <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is calculated. The equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is calculated, so far as is practical, in real time with as much accuracy as possible. However, the present invention can still operate if the equilibrium price is not known precisely, so long as it is known whether, within the margin of error of calculation of the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and monitored current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>, there is a difference between them and the direction of that difference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> it is determined whether the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is greater than the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>(i.e. a rising market), in which case at step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> the item is purchased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is not greater than the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>then at step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> it is determined whether the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is less than the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>(i.e. a falling market), in which case the item is sold at step <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The amount to be bought or sold is somewhat arbitrary. To maximise the effect on the market, as much as possible can be bought or sold. In the case of buying, the maximum amount is limited by the amount of funds of the purchaser and of the item available. In the case of selling, the maximum is the amount of the item held at that time available for sale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Another option is for the marketplace controller to agree with the marketplace participants that its buy and sell activities will be restricted to certain volumes and/or amounts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Following a purchase (step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) or sale (step <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>), the method returns to its monitoring of current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>and calculation of equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, i.e. return to step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the case in which the equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>equals the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>, no action is taken (step <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>) and the method returns to step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, in effect to await market fluctuations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> To allow for margins of error in the values of the current trading price P<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>and equilibrium price P<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, the buy and sell operations may be set to only take place in the event of there being a predetermined difference between the two values. The predetermined difference may vary over time and between sell and purchase operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention enable faster communication of marketplace equilibrium price fluctuations to marketplace participants by accelerating the movement of the marketplace to the equilibrium price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The reader&apos;s attention is directed to all papers and documents which are filed concurrently with or previous to this specification in connection with this application and which are open to public inspection with this specification, and the contents of all such papers and documents are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> All of the features disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), and/or all of the steps of any method or process so disclosed, may be combined in any combination, except combinations where at least some of such features and/or steps are mutually exclusive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Each feature disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), may be replaced by alternative features serving the same, equivalent or similar purpose, unless expressly stated otherwise. Thus, unless expressly stated otherwise, each feature disclosed is one example only of a generic series of equivalent or similar features. </paragraph>

The invention extends to any novel one, or any novel combination, of the features disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), or to any novel one, or any novel combination, of the steps of any method or process so disclosed. </paragraph>
