<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a blow-off nozzle type bathtub with illumination, and in more details, to a blow-off nozzle type bathtub with illumination which can enhance a mental relaxation effect by illuminating the inside of a bathtub and also can enhance a physical fatigue recovery effect by applying a blow-off fluid to hot water in the bathtub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As a conventional bathtub, there has been generally known a bathtub <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as a perspective view and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as a Y-Y cross-sectional view. That is, the bathtub <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is constituted such that a rectangular bathtub container <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is embedded into a floor surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a semicircular chair portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on which a bather sits is formed on a bottom surface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, handles <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which the bather grips are mounted on both sides of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and a headrest <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> made of rubber or the like with which a head portion of the bather is brought into contact is mounted on one end portion of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Hot water or water is supplied into the inside of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from a spout <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Here, with respect to a western-style bathtub having a relatively shallow bottom, to enable a bather to take a relaxed bathing posture, there has been also known a bathtub which forms a slanted surface inclined from an upper portion to a lower portion, that is, a backrest on an inner surface of a bathtub body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, the bathtubs having such general structures lacks in ideas or fail to give the high-grade feeling to a bather and hence, they have been unsuccessful to give a highly effective fatigue recovery effect and a mental relaxation effect to the bather. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, recently, there has been proposed a bathtub which is rich in ideas by directly illuminating the inside of the bathtub using a light source. That is, for example, a bathtub having an underwater illumination (so as called as &ldquo;water light&rdquo;) having a cross section shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> has been proposed. In such a bathtub <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, opening portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are formed in the bathtub <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by cutting out portions of side walls <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> or a bottom wall <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> of a bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> for enabling the transmission of light, transparent members <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> such as lens are adhered to inner surfaces of opening portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and light emitting members <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> such as lamps which are turned on by a switch not shown in the drawing are mounted in the opening portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> whereby the inside of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is illuminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, with respect to the bathtub <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with underwater illumination which forms the opening portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for transmitting light in the bathtub wall, there exists a fear that hot water or water leaks from these opening portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or electricity leaks due to this leaking of water when the light emitting members <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are formed of lamps. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide sealing members <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> on a back surface of the vessel as shown in the drawing besides mounting the transparent members <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> on an inner surface of the vessel and hence, the structure becomes complicated and pushes up a cost. Further, even when such means is provided, there still remains a possibility of leaking of water or leaking of electricity due to the fatigue generated as time lapses and hence, it is necessary to confirm the safety by always performing the maintenance and the checking. Still further, since the lamps provide the direct illumination, it gives rise to the fatigue on eyes of a bather and hence, there have been drawbacks such as the reduction of a relaxed feeling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, recently, for enhancing a warming effect or a massaging effect, there has been known a jet bath (or blow-off bath) which blows off hot water mixing air bubbles therein to hot water in the inside of a bathtub or a blower bath (or air-bubble bath) which generates bubbles in hot water in the inside of a bathtub by forcedly supplying air using a blower or the like. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an example of the jet bath. As shown in the drawing, in a bathtub <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, a hot water intake portion <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and jet discharging portions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are formed in a peripheral wall <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of a bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> as through holes. When a circulating pump <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is driven by a switch <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, hot water in the inside of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is suck from the hot water intake portion <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> through an intake pipe <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, is supplied to the jet discharging portions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> through a supply pipe <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, and is discharged into the inside of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Here, the blower bath is a bath which uses a blower, a compressor or the like in place of the circulation pump <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> and blows off air into hot water in the inside of a bathtub vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The jet-bath type bathtub <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> or the blower-bath type bathtub provided with such a dedicated blow-off piping structure can surely generates an warming effect or a massaging effect so that they are effective in recovering the physical fatigue. However, it is impossible for these bathtubs to enhance a mental relaxation effect. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances and it is an object of the present invention to provide a blow-off nozzle type bathtub with illumination which can simultaneously satisfy a physical fatigue recovery effect and a mental relaxation effect which cannot be achieved by conventional bathtubs and can obtain a high-grade feeling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a blow-off nozzle type bathtub with illumination and the above-mentioned object of the present invention can be achieved by mounting units each of which comprises a cap having a plurality of nozzles for blowing off a fluid and for irradiating an illumination light in a head portion thereof and having an inside thereof formed in a hollow shape, a fluid supply member having a distal end opening portion thereof connected to the hollow inside of the cap and a proximal end opening portion thereof connected to a fluid supply source which is subjected to a drive control, a light guide member which has an end surface of a distal end portion thereof directed to the hollow inside of the cap and an end surface of a proximal end portion thereof directed to an illumination light source which is subjected to a drive control, a fixing member for fixing and supporting the fluid supply member and the light guide member on a bottom wall of a bathtub vessel on a plurality of nozzles which are formed in the bottom wall of the bathtub vessel as through holes.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Since the bathtub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constituted in the above-mentioned manner, when hot water is stored in the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the switch <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is disposed in the inside of a bathroom is turned on, by way of the control device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the halogen lamp <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the light source device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> emits light and, at the same time, the motor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is driven to rotate the color filter disc <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the light which passes through respective color filters is changed sequentially (for example, in the order of red, blue, green, yellow) and is irradiated to the end surface of the proximal end portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the fiber cable <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. This light is guided to the distal end portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the group of optical fibers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through the group of optical fibers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and then is irradiated to the hot water in the inside of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the hollow portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through the nozzles <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. When the hot water is irradiated in this manner, the color of the hot water is changed one after the other and respective colors shine brightly so that the bather perceives a feeling as if he is bathing in the world of fantasy so that the bather can enjoy bathing with an extremely relaxed feeling. Accordingly, with the use of this bathtub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the mental relaxation can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Further, when the switch <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is turned on, the blower <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is driven by means of the control device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, the valve <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is opened to forcibly supply air into the air supply pipes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Air forcibly supplied into the air supply pipes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is, as indicated by the dotted line and an arrow F, introduced into the hollow portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the cavity portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the foot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by way of the air introduction passage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the drum portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B of the body <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the air nozzles <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the head portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>H of the body <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Then, air passes through the nozzles <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the head portion of the cap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and is blown off into the hot water in the inside of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this manner, when air is blown off from the bottom wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, bubbles rise toward a liquid level and soon extinguishes on the liquid level. Minus ions are generated due to such generation and extinction of the bubbles and the minus ions act on the bather so that an advantageous effect that the bather can activate his body is obtained. Further, along with the generation of bubbles, a liquid flow is generated in the bathtub so that the energy of this flow provides a gentle stimulus to the bather which is different from a stimulus obtained by a jet bath. Accordingly, the bather can receive the massaging effect together with the warming effect so that the circulation of blood is promoted whereby the bather can recover from the physical fatigue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In this manner, according to the bathtub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the mental relaxation effect and the physical fatigue recovery effect can be simultaneously obtained and, further, it is possible to obtain an outstanding advantageous effect that the hot water shines brightly and beautifully so that a high-grade feeling is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Further, in the bathtub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the head portions of the caps <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for blowing off a fluid and irradiating illumination light which are mounted on the bottom wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed in a spherical shape. Accordingly, air blown off from the nozzles <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the illumination light irradiated from the nozzles <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are spread in all directions in the inside of the bathtub so that it is possible to make the bubbles generated in the whole hot water in the inside of the bathtub and to make the illumination light shine brightly in the whole hot water in the inside of the bathtub. Further, when the caps <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are mounted on the bottom surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, it is possible to prevent the bather from slipping and turning down in the inside of the bathtub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> When the bather turns off the switch <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> after bathing, the valve <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is closed by means of the control device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, the driving of the blower <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the light source device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is stopped. When the supply of air is stopped in this manner, the hot water in the inside of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> backflows in the air supply passage indicated by an arrow F in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and flows into and is stored at a level of the valve <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> provided to the air supply pipes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This stored hot water is, however, returned to the inside of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by turning on the switch <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> again thus opening the valve <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, restarting the blower <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Further, when all bathings in the day are completed, the residual water treatment is performed such that the drain opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is formed in the bottom wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is opened so as to remove the residual hot water in the inside of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the outside of the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, the switch <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is turned on so as to discharge the residual hot water remaining in the air supply passage into the bathtub vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and to discharge the residual water from the drain opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The content of the present invention has been explained in conjunction with one embodiment of the present invention. However, the present invention is not always limited to this embodiment and following various modifications can be made with resect to the constitution of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> First of all, although the above-mentioned embodiment relates to the blower-bath type bathtub which blows off air into the hot water in the inside of the bathtub, it is possible to change this bathtub to a jet-bath type bathtub which blows off hot water in place of air in a known manner using a circulation pump or the like. Here, in the jet-bath type bathtub, the stimulus given to the human body is strong and hence, it is preferable to use the blower-bath type bathtub which provides the gentle stimulus in the bathtub with illumination according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With respect to the shape of the head portion of the cap for blowing off a fluid and for irradiating illumination light, the shape is not limited to a spherical shape and may be a cone shape or a saddle shape. Further, it is needless to say that the number and the size of the nozzles which are formed in the head portion as through holes can be changed in a various manner when necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The light source in the light source device for illumination is not limited to the halogen lamp and various kinds of lamps including an LED (Light Emitting Diode), a fluorescent lamp and the like can be used as the light source. Further, the size and the number of the optical fibers which constitute the light guide members can be arbitrarily changed depending on the necessity. Further, colors of the light source which are used for illumination can be changed into given colors by arranging kinds of color filters. Still further, the rotational speed of the disc provided with these color filters can be controlled to an arbitrary speed depending on the necessity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As has been described heretofore, the blow-off nozzle type bathtub with illumination according to the present invention can be manufactured by the simple operation which only mounts the simple units each of which is simply constituted of the cap having a plurality of nozzles for blowing off a fluid and irradiating illumination light and members which supply a fluid to the nozzles and guide the illumination light to the nozzles on the nozzles formed in the bottom wall of the bathtub vessel as through holes. According to the bathtub which is manufactured in such a manner, the mental relaxation effect can be obtained together with the physical fatigue recovery effect and, further, it is possible to obtain a practically excellent effect that the hot water shines brightly and beautifully so that the high-grade feeling is achieved. </paragraph>
