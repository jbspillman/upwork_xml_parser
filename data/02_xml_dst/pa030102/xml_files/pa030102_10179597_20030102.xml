<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a fastener product made of a synthetic resin, which product is excellent in resistance to moist heat and resistance to hydrolysis. More particularly, the present invention relates to recyclable fastener products of synthetic resin such as slide fasteners of synthetic resin, separable fasteners or surface fasteners of synthetic resin and snap tapes (tapes with snap buttons) of synthetic resin, which products are excellent in durability against wet heat and capable of maintaining the stable state of engagement without producing deterioration of strength even when repeatedly left under a high-temperature and high-humidity atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Most of the clothes such as working clothes heretofore used in a clean room of a pharmaceutical factory and those used in a hospital, medical service sites, nursing facilities, and the like are disposable. Since these clothes are disposed of by incineration as industrial waste after use, the desirability of reusing the clothes has come to find enthusiastic recognition year after year from the viewpoints of environmental pollution and saving of resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to reuse these products in the above-mentioned working places, the clothes must be washed and subjected to autoclaving (120-130&deg; C.&times;30 minutes) with high-temperature and high-pressure steam as a sterilization treatment every day. Therefore, the products using the conventional polyester long fibers easily suffered hydrolysis by repeated processing and resulted in deterioration of strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In recent years, polyester fibers excelling in resistance to hydrolysis have been developed. As a result, the durability of the textile of a woven and/or knitted product against wet heat has been improved considerably, and under the present situation it is possible to provide the clothes which can be reused under the above conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the above problems will also hold for the fastener products to be attached to the clothes. For example, a slide fastener made of a synthetic resin will be deteriorated by about 50 rounds of autoclaving due to hydrolysis and thus cannot be used any longer. Specifically, in the case of coupling elements of polyester, for example, the deterioration thereof due to hydrolysis with high-temperature steam proceeds during repeated use thereof for a relatively short period and autoclaving. Consequently, cracks, flaws, the fracturing phenomena into the shape of fiber and the like may occur in the engagement portions (heads) of the coupling elements, thereby causing deterioration of strength thereof. Eventually, the state of engagement of coupling elements will come off and the product will no longer function as a fastener. On the other hand, in the case of coupling elements made of nylon, although they have an advantage of hardly causing deterioration of the strength, they poses the problem of suffering discoloration in brown with the high temperature steam. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is therefore a fundamental object of the present invention is to provide a fastener product made of a synthetic resin such as a slide fastener of synthetic resin, a separable fastener of synthetic resin and a snap tape (a tape with a snap button) of synthetic resin, which product exhibits excellent durability against wet heat and is capable of maintaining the stable state of engagement without producing deterioration of strength, discoloration, etc. even when repeatedly left under the high-temperature and high-humidity atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a recyclable fastener product made of a synthetic resin such as a slide fastener of synthetic resin, a separable fastener of synthetic resin and a snap tape of synthetic resin, which product is excellent in both the resistance to moist heat and resistance to hydrolysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the objects mentioned above, the fundamental mode of the present invention provides an engagement member made of a synthetic resin comprising an attachment part and an engagement part, which member is characterized by the fact that at least the engagement part mentioned above is made of a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin. The term &ldquo;attachment part&rdquo; as used herein refers to a part to which an engagement part is attached or a part to be utilized for attachment to the other products, such as a fastener tape of a slide fastener, a base portion or base fabric of a separable fastener or surface fastener, and a tape of a snap tape or snap fastener. And the term &ldquo;engagement part&rdquo; as used herein refers to such parts as coupling elements of a slide fastener, hocks or loops of a separable fastener, and male and/or female detachably fitting parts of a snap tape or snap fastener. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material mentioned above is polyester having a carbodiimide-based hydrolytic stabilizing agent incorporated therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a more concrete first embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a slide fastener made of a synthetic resin having a pair of fastener tapes and coupling elements fixed to the edges of the fastener tapes and characterized by the fact that the fastener tapes and the coupling elements mentioned above are made of a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> When the slide fastener comprises sewing threads for the fixation of the coupling elements to the fastener tapes and/or core cords extended as inserted through the individual coupling elements in the longitudinal direction thereof, the sewing threads and/or the core cords may be made of a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Further, in the slide fastener of the type having upper and lower stop members provided respectively at the upper and lower ends of the rows of coupling elements, the upper and lower stop members may be made of a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material as in the case of the other component parts mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the open-link type slide fastener which has a pin-and-box separator and a pair of reinforcing sheet-like members formed integrally or not integrally with the pin-and-box separator (lacking a lower stop member), which have fixed to the lower end portions of the fastener tapes, the pin-and-box separator and the reinforcing sheet-like members mentioned above may be made of a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material as in the case of the other component parts mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, in any of the cases mentioned above a slide fastener has substantially all the component parts thereof made of the same chemical type or system of material. Incidentally, the slider itself may be manufactured from a metallic material etc. and it has no problem in terms of resistance to hydrolysis. When the recycling use is taken into consideration, however, the slider may be made of the same chemical type of synthetic resin material as the other component parts mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a more concrete second embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a separable fastener made of a synthetic resin comprising a base part and an engagement part composed of a multiplicity of engaging elements formed on the obverse side of the base part and characterized by the fact that the base part and the engagement part mentioned above are made of a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a more concrete third embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a snap tape or a snap fastener made of a synthetic resin comprising a tape and an engagement part composed of male and/or female detachably fitting parts formed on the tape and characterized by the fact that the tape and the engagement part mentioned above are made of a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Since the fastener products of synthetic resin of the present invention, such as a slide fastener of synthetic resin, a separable fastener of synthetic resin and a snap tape of synthetic resin, are made of a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin, particularly polyester having a carbodiimide-based hydrolytic stabilizing agent incorporated therein, they exhibit excellent durability against wet heat and are capable of maintaining the stable state of engagement for a long period without producing deterioration of strength and degradation of the material due to hydrolysis, particularly change in the form of engagement part, and securing the stable state of the tape or base part to which the engagement part is attached, even when repeatedly left under the high-temperature and high-humidity atmosphere. Further, when the sewing threads are also manufactured from a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material, it is possible to provide a fastener product of synthetic resin which hardly incurs breakage of the sewing threads. In the case of a slide fastener, when the core cords are also manufactured from a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material, the attached state of coupling elements becomes more stable. Accordingly, they can be advantageously used as fastener products to be attached to clothes such as working clothes to be used in a clean room of a pharmaceutical factory and those used in a hospital, medical service sites, nursing facilities, and the like which are repeatedly subjected to a sterilization treatment with high-temperature and high-pressure steam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When all the component parts of the fastener products are manufactured from an essentially identical hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material, they are recyclable and contribute greatly to the conservation of the earth&apos;s environment and the effective utilization of resources. Further, since the raw materials for the component parts are unified, it is relatively easy to recover the discarded fastener products and the discarded plastic materials.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The present inventors, after pursuing a diligent study on the use of the fastener products of synthetic resin such as a slide fastener of synthetic resin, a separable fastener of synthetic resin and a snap tape of synthetic resin under the high temperature and high humidity atmosphere, have found that the fastener products as mentioned above made of a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin, particularly polyester having a carbodiimide-based hydrolytic stabilizing agent incorporated therein exhibit excellent durability against wet heat, are capable of maintaining the stable state of engagement without producing such defects as deterioration of strength and discoloration even when repeatedly left under the high-temperature and high-humidity atmosphere, fulfill such characteristics as mechanical properties, resistance to wear and durability to withstand the friction due to the sliding motion which are expected of any fastener products for a long period, and are recyclable as well. The present invention has been perfected as a result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> To be specific, the fundamental technical idea of the present invention consists in manufacturing the component parts of fastener products with a synthetic resin material which exhibits excellent resistance to moist heat and to hydrolysis. It is provided, however, that there are times when the slider itself should be manufactured from other synthetic resin or a metal, depending on the function or construction which is expected from the slide fastener. In this case, the slider can be manufactured from the material which is so needed. In the case of the slide fastener using the slider of this description, it is relatively easy to recover the slider selectively from the discarded slide fastener and the discarded plastic materials emanating from the production line can be wholly reclaimed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Since the fastener products of synthetic resin of the present invention exhibit excellent durability against wet heat, they are capable of maintaining the stable state of engagement for a long period without producing degradation of the material due to hydrolysis, particularly change in the form of engagement parts such as coupling elements, snap buttons and engagement elements, and securing the stable state of the tape or base part to which the engagement parts such as coupling elements are attached, even when repeatedly subjected to washing and autoclaving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When the individual component parts of the fastener product are manufactured from the same chemical type of synthetic resin material, it is possible to provide recyclable fastener products of synthetic resin. Further when the cloths of clothing on which the fastener products are fitted are manufactured from the same chemical type synthetic resins as those of the fastener products, it is made possible to recycle the whole clothing having the fastener products attached thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material used in the present invention means a synthetic resin having a hydrolytic stabilizing agent incorporated therein. As the synthetic resin, various synthetic resin materials such as polyester, polycarbonate, a polymer blend of polycarbonate/polyester, and nylon may be used. Since polyester is commonly used as the raw material for the hydrolysis-resistant cloths of clothing, polyester such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) is more preferable in terms of recycle use and such characteristics as mechanical properties, durability to withstand the friction due to the sliding motion and resistance to wear which are expected of any fastener products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As hydrolytic stabilizing agents, carbodiimides, preferably bis-carbodiimides represented by the formulas R&mdash;N&boxH;C&boxH;N&mdash;R and R&mdash;N&boxH;C&boxH;N&mdash;R&prime; may be advantageously used. In the above formulas, R and R&prime; represent C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>substituted or unsubstituted alkyl groups, substituted or unsubstituted aryl groups, wherein substitutions being halogen atom, nitro group, amino group, sulfonyl group, hydroxyl group, alkyl group, or aryl group, and wherein R and R&prime; may or may not be the same. As concrete examples of such compounds, 2,2&prime;,6,6&prime;-tetraisopropyldiphenyl carbodiimide; a bis-carbodiimide produced by Rhein-Chemie GmbH of Germany and marketed under the trademark designation of STABAXOL, and aromatic polycarbodiimides such as 2,4-diisocyanate-1,3,5-tris(1-methylethyl) copolymer with 2,6-diisopropyldiisocyanate and benzene-2,4-diisocyanato-1,3,5-tris(1-methylethyl) homopolymer may be cited. Properly, a hydrolytic stabilizing agent may be added to the synthetic resin material in an amount of about 1 to 5% by weight, preferably 1.5 to 2.5% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The hydrolytic stabilizing agent mentioned above is generally produced as a masterbatch made of a career resin and a hydrolytic stabilizing agent. For instance, the masterbatch may comprise about 70 to 98% by weight of a career resin and about 2 to 30% by weight of a hydrolytic stabilizing agent. The most preferable proportion is 15% by weight of the hydrolytic stabilizing agent to 85% by weight of the career resin. The career resin is preferred to be the same chemical type as a synthetic resin material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Monofilaments or multifilaments may be produced by kneading such hydrolytic stabilizing agent-containing masterbatch chips and synthetic resin pellets and melt-extruding the resultant blend. They are used for weaving and/or knitting a fastener tape of a slide fastener, manufacturing sewing threads and core cords, weaving and/or knitting a base fabric and engagement elements of a separable fastener and a tape of a snap tape according to the present invention. Coiled coupling elements of a slide fastener may be manufactured from the monofilament. Further, coupling elements, separable fasteners, snap buttons, etc. may be formed by injection molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Now, the modes of embodying the present invention in the component parts of the fastener products will be specifically described below with reference to various fastener products which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

The fastener tapes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are formed by weaving and/or knitting hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin fibers, manufactured from a non-woven fabric, or made of a sheet of hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin. The coupling elements <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are known in various forms such as, for example, those of the type obtained by injection molding the individual coupling elements and simultaneously attaching them fast to the edges of the fastener tapes, the continuous coupling elements such as the coiled coupling elements obtained by winding a monofilament of hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin in the shape of a coil and the so-called zigzag coupling elements obtained by alternately connecting vertically in a zigzagging pattern in the longitudinal direction the portions bent in the shape of a letter U in the lateral direction in a plane, and the extrusion molded coupling elements obtained by attaching the opposite end portions of the individual coupling elements by means of extrusion molding to the two separate connecting cords (core cords) laid parallel to each other in the longitudinal direction thereby forming a composite resembling a ladder and bending the composite in the shape of a letter U around the longitudinal center line thereof. These examples of various coupling elements will be described afterward with reference to the relevant drawings. Then, the coiled coupling elements which include a core cord and a sewing thread among the component parts thereof will be also described afterward with reference to the relevant drawings. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> denotes a slider which is slidable along the opposed rows of coupling elements for making and breaking engagement of the coupling elements. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> denotes a core cord which is inserted in the longitudinal direction through the empty space inside the spiral of the coiled coupling element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the reference numeral <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> denotes a sewing thread sewing the core cord <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the coiled coupling element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>along the longitudinal edge of the fastener tape <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The pin-and-box separator does not need to be limited to what is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The slide fastener of hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin according to the present invention can be applied not only to the slide fasteners of the types illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> but also to various fastener products. It can be applied, for example, to a railed fastener product, i.e. a fastener of the type having a groove formed along the edge of one of paired opposed sheet members of a container bag and a ridge matched to the groove and formed similarly on the other sheet member such that the bag is closed by bringing the groove and the ridge into mutual engagement. Likewise in this type of slide fastener, a slider adapted to slide along the opposed edges of the bag for the purpose of closure is utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The selection of the type of slide fastener product for proper application of the material depends also on the kind of synthetic resin to be used for the product.

The polyester resins are suitable for both the slide fasteners and the railed fasteners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Then, some embodiments of applying the present invention to the separable fasteners will be specifically described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a partial perspective view of a male fastener member illustrating a structural example of typical hook-like engaging elements of the molded (injected) type, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a partially cross-sectioned side view representing the state before engagement with loop-like engaging elements of the opposite female fastener member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The component parts of these male fastener member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and female fastener member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are manufactured from the hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin material mentioned above according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the male fastener member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17, a</cross-reference> hook-like engaging element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> raised from a base part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has a stem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which has a rear surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>rising obliquely in a smooth curve from the base part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a front surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>rising upwardly from the base part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a hook-like engaging portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> extending forwardly and curving downwardly from a distal end of the stem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The stem <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has on one side surface a first reinforcing rib <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> perpendicularly rising from the base part and on both sides thereof second reinforcing ribs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> raised from the base part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The first reinforcing rib <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> projects upwardly with respect to the rear surface of the hook-like engaging portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to a predetermined extent and terminates in an arcuate upper end to assume an equilateral triangle. The height of the apex O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of the first reinforcing rib <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is defined to be smaller than the height of an apex O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the hook-like engaging portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The apex O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of the first reinforcing rib <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is set at the height above a tangent line which touches the hook-like engaging portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> at the lowest tip O<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of hooked leading end and which is substantially parallel to the upper surface of the flat base part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated example, the second reinforcing ribs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are set at the height lower than that of the first reinforcing rib <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and has a mount-like shape with its arcuate top surface and skirt parts enlarging downwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The function of the hook structure of the male fastener member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> constructed as mentioned above will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. The presence of the reinforcing ribs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> prevents the hook-like engaging elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from falling down. Further, when the hook-like engaging elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are depressed by the base part <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the opposite female fastener member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a multiplicity of loop-like engaging elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, although the hook-like engaging portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is initially inclined slightly forwardly by the pressing force until the base part <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the apex O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>of the first reinforcing rib <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the first reinforcing rib <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> bears the base part <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to prevent the hook-like engaging portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> from further inclination, thereby maintaining the poses of the hook-like engaging elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> engaged with the loop-like engaging elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Since the hook-like engaging portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> as slightly forwardly inclined becomes smaller in radius of curvature of the crooked shape, the loop-like engaging elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> once engaged with the hook-like engaging elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be retained more reliably than usual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> illustrate an embodiment of applying the present invention to a woven separable fastener, i.e. a separable fastener which is manufactured by preparing monofilaments or multifilements of the hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin according to the present invention and interweaving them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In a female fastener member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, pile yarns formed of hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin filaments are interwoven in a pile pattern into a base part (base fabric) <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> produced by plain weaving hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin filaments so as to give rise to pile loops (loop-like engaging elements) <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which protrude from the obverse side of the base part. A male fastener member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is identical in structure with the female fastener member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> mentioned above except that the pile loops protruding from the obverse side of the base part <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are partially cut to form hook-like engaging elements <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, coating layers <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of synthetic rubber or synthetic resin are applied to the reverse sides of the base parts (base fabrics) <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> respectively, for the purpose of preventing the loop-like and hook-like engaging elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> from being left out and to impart the shape retention property to the bas parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Then, some embodiments of applying the present invention to the knitted separable fasteners will be described below with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a view schematically illustrating a warp-knitted base fabric <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for a separable fastener which functions as a female fastener member to be attached to a breathable product. The warp-knitted base fabric <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for a separable fastener is manufactured by knitting a base texture out of pile knitting yarns and ground yarns to form on wales <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> a multiplicity of pile loops (loop-like engaging elements) <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> serving as engagement elements of a separable fastener and passing insertion yarns in the wales direction and the course direction according to the marquisette texture so that a multiplicity of stitches <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the substantially rectangular shape serving as breather portions are formed between wales <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The upper side parts of the pile loops <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of this warp-knitted base fabric <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for a separable fastener is cut to form hooks and the resultant fabric is used as a male fastener member. Incidentally, such a warp-knitted base fabric <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for a separable fastener has pile knitting parts and the selvage parts on both sides thereof. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain simultaneously several warp-knitted tapes for separable fasteners by severing the base fabric along the center of this selvage by a slitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> illustrates an example of the texture of the pile knitted part of the warp-knitted base fabric <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (strip tape before severing) for separable fasteners. The pile knitted part is composed of the pile formation threads <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which forms the pile loops <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the two needle stitching threads <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and lateral insertion threads <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which form the ground. The pile formation thread <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> consists of a multifilament and is used for forming pile loops <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> by a sinker by overfeeding more positively than other threads. The pile formation thread <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is used to form the pile loops <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> every other course while lapping with an adjoining knitting needle and, as shown by the structural diagram of the pile knitted part in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, it is knitted so as to be arranged in the longitudinal direction in a zigzag pattern. Therefore, the pile loops <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be engaged with the hooks of the opposite male fastener member always with high engagement probability, no matter what direction the hooks are directed, and the performance of the separable fastener is greatly improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In case open stitches are formed in the warp-knitted base fabric <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for separable fasteners as mentioned above, a coating material such as synthetic rubber and synthetic resin is applied to the reverse side of the base fabric to stabilize a ground texture and engaging elements. However, such coating is not necessary when closed stitches are formed in the pile loops which constitute engaging elements and the chain yarns which form the ground texture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As the knitting yarns which form the pile loops mentioned above, monofilament threads or multi-filament threads are used when knitting the base fabric of a female fastener member, and monofilament threads are used when knitting the base fabric of a male fastener member. These knitting yarns and the threads which constitute the ground texture are manufactured from the hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> illustrates an example of application of the present invention to a snap tape, i.e. snap buttons integrally attached to a tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the manufacture of this snap tape <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, a plurality of fitting holes <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are formed in a long tape <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> at predetermined intervals in advance, this tape is fed into a metal mold for molding, and ring-like base materials <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> that are components member for forming female fitting parts <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and/or male fitting parts <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> are integrally injection-molded with the tape on both the obverse and reverse sides thereof so as to nip the peripheral edges of the fitting holes <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> mentioned above. Then, a plurality of base materials <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> having the same form and integrally molded on one and the same tape <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction thereof at predetermined intervals as mentioned above are alternately formed into female engaging parts (hole parts) <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and male engaging parts (protruding parts) <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> to form a product having female fitting parts <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and male fitting parts <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> alternately and integrally fixed to one and the same tape <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The engagement is performed by snap-in fitting the male engaging part <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> into the female engaging part <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Although in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> the base materials <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> are alternately formed into the female engaging parts <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and the male engaging parts <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction of the tape <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> at predetermined intervals, the female engaging parts (hole parts) <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be formed in one tape and the male engaging parts (protruding parts) <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> may be formed in other tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The tape <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the engagement parts composed of female fitting parts <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and/or male fitting parts <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> mentioned above are manufactured from a hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When the synthetic resin material is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), basically the PET can be used for all the component parts of fastener products. In the case of a slide fastener, however, preferably the slider which is required to possess high mechanical strength is made of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) instead, with the PBT in the body portion of the slider reinforced with such reinforcing fibers as glass fibers. In recycling the slide fastener of polyester answering this description, it is preferable to remove the slider from the slide fastener discarded as no longer useful and utilize the remainder of the slide fastener exclusively for the sake of reclamation. When the used slide fastener is wholly recovered and put to reclamation, the material that is obtained at all is in the form of a PET/PBT polymer blend. In the case of such an open-link type slide fastener as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the pin-and-box separator is preferred to be made of PBT likewise on account of mechanical strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In any of the cases mentioned above, however, the component parts of the fastener products can be simultaneously dyed in the same hue by piece dyeing because the materials for the component parts are invariably polyester. Though various dyes are usable for the piece dyeing, a disperse dye is used preferably. The disperse dye that can be used herein is known in various types such as, for example, quinone type disperse dyes, azo type disperse dyes, and anthraquinone type disperse dyes. Various dyeing assistants in popular use such as leveling agents and dye fastness promotors can be additionally incorporated in a dye bath as is usually practiced. While various methods are available for the dyeing under discussion, the method of beam dyeing proves to be advantageous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In setting the used polyester fastener products to the process of recycle, the reclaimed polyester may be used for manufacturing the fastener products such as slide fasteners, separable fasteners, and snap tapes again or for manufacturing other textile products and molded articles such as binding bands for packages and containers. When the reclaimed polyester is used as the raw material for other molded articles, it may incorporate therein a varying filler like such reinforcing fibers as glass fibers, carbon fibers, or aramid fibers or it may be blended with such other thermoplastic resin as PBT. In manufacturing a slide fastener by using reclaimed PET, the slider, pin-and-box separator, coupling elements, and sewing thread which require high mechanical strength are preferred to use virgin PET or a blend of virgin PET with reclaimed PET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> When the synthetic resin material is a polyamide, all the component parts of fastener products except a slider of a slide fastener, i.e. fastener tapes, coupling elements, a pin-and-box separator, reinforcing sheet-like members, upper and lower stop members, sewing threads, and core cords of a slide fastener, a base part and engaging elements of a separable fastener, and a tape and engagement parts of a snap tape can be made of the polyamide. The slider in a slide fastener can be made of the PBT mentioned above or a metal. When the slide fastener of polyamide answering this description is used in the recycling path, the slider is removed from the used slide fastener and the remainder of slide fastener is recycled. As concrete examples of the use found for the reclaimed polyamide, the component parts of a slide fastener excepting a slider, separable fasteners, snap tapes and other similar fastener products, textile products, and molded articles may be cited. In the case of the fastener products made of polyamide, similarly to the fastener products made of polyester mentioned above, the component parts made of polyamide can be simultaneously dyed in the same hue by piece dyeing. As concrete examples of the polyamide which is advantageously used herein, nylon <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, nylon <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and copolymerized nylon may be cited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> When the cloths, such auxiliary materials as lining cloths, core cloths, and sewing threads, and such resinous accessories as buttons and snaps for garments on which the recyclable fastener product made of a synthetic resin according to the present invention is fitted are made of the same or homologous hydrolysis-resistant synthetic resin as that of the fastener product, it is made possible to recover the used products wholly and utilize them for reclamation without requiring the individual component parts thereof to be separated and selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The regeneration of the slide fastener from a discarded PET material is advantageously attained by granulating the recovered PET to strand-like chips, subjecting the chips to drying under a vacuum and, as occasion demands, to solid-phase polymerization, and extrusion molding the resultant polymer into a monofilament. Otherwise, the polymer may be molded into a sewing thread or multifilaments of a minute diameter. Alternatively, the polymer may be injection molded to form other component parts. In the case of a slide fastener, subsequently, the extrusion molded monofilament is drawn, formed in the shape of a coil, sewn to the edges of fastener tapes obtained by weaving and/or knitting PET fibers with the sewing thread, then heat set, and thereafter dyed to a desired color by piece dyeing. What is important in this operation is that the water content of the dry chips be repressed to the lowest possible extent and the decline of the intrinsic viscosity (I.V.) or limiting viscosity number before and after the work of monofilament extrusion be restrained for ensuring manufacture of fastener stringers of prescribed quality. The decline of the intrinsic viscosity before and after the work of monofilament extrusion is considered to originate in the hydrolysis of the resinous material caused by the water contained in the chips and is liable to induce breakage of the monofilament during the course of drawing. The water content of the dry chips, therefore, should be restrained 50 ppm (0.005%) and less, preferably 30 ppm and less, and more preferably 20 ppm and less. Particularly, in the manufacture of such products as sewing threads and multifilaments which have minute diameters, the water content should be kept 20 ppm and less, preferably 10 ppm and less, and more preferably 5 ppm and less in consideration of the possibility of breakage thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Now, the present invention will be described specifically below with reference to working example. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Monofilaments manufactured from a mixture of PET and masterbatch chips (STABAXOL&reg; KE9291 of Rhein-Chemie GmbH, consisting of a carrier resin PET (containing 5% of PE) containing 15% by weight of aromatic polycarbodiimide (STABAXOL&reg; P100)) in a weight ratio of 7:1 were formed into coiled coupling elements. Fastener tapes were prepared by weaving PET high-tenacity yarn (BRABER&reg; of Asahi Kasei Kogyo K.K., containing no hydrolytic stabilizing agent) and sewing threads and core cords were also manufactured from the same PET high-tenacity yarn. A slide fastener as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> was produced by using these component members. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Comparative Example </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A slide fastener was produced by following the procedure of Example except that only PET was used as a raw material for coiled elements. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Test Example </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Each of the slide fasteners prepared in Example and Comparative Example mentioned above was repeatedly subjected to autoclaving (126&deg; C.&times;30 minutes) and then tested for lateral tensile strength of a fastener stringer and for resistance to sliding motion when opening and closing a slide fastener in accordance with the methods described in JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) S 3015. The measurement results of the lateral tensile strength are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the measurement results of the resistance to sliding motion when opening the slide fastener in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, and the measurement results of the resistance to sliding motion when closing the slide fastener in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The guarantee value specified as the lateral tensile strength of a fastener stringer is 60 kg and over. Although the slide fasteners prepared in Example and Comparative Example satisfied this requirement even after 50 rounds of autoclaving, the slide fastener prepared in Comparative Example by using coiled elements manufactured from PET only had poor strength so as to cause breakages of coupling elements and sewing threads used for sewing coupling elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The guarantee value specified as the resistance to sliding motion in opening (when opening the slide fastener with a slider) and closing (when closing the slide fastener with a slider) is 700 g and under, respectively. Although the slide fastener prepared in Example satisfied this requirement even after about 100 rounds of autoclaving, the slide fastener prepared in Comparative Example had a value far from this guarantee value and its coupling elements had coarse surfaces containing a plenty of cracks with hangnails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Further, when fastener tapes, sewing threads and core cords all manufactured from hydrolytic stabilizing agent-containing polyester fibers were used to prepare a slide fastener, the durability of the slide fastener against autoclaving has been further improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> While certain specific embodiments and working example have been disclosed herein, the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The described embodiments and example are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are, therefore, intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The disclosure in Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-194563 of Jun. 27, 2001 is incorporated here by reference. This Japanese Patent Application describes the invention described hereinabove and claimed in the claims appended hereinbelow and provides the basis for a claim of priority for the instant invention under 35 U.S.C. 119. </paragraph>
