<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An improved support is provided for locating a lamp filament axially within a lamp sleeve. The illustrated support is a spiral coil that includes a small diameter center portion that makes contact with the filament. On either side of the filament-contacting portion, the coil opens up to larger diameters for contacting the inner wall of the quartz sleeve within which the filament is housed. The support thus appears H-shaped when viewed from the side. A lamp filament is also provided with expansion compensation sections at either end of a central section. The filament wire in the compensation sections is wound into coils having a greater diameter and also a greater spacing between windings, as compared to coil in the central section. The expansion compensation sections are preferably capable of compressing and thereby absorbing thermal expansion of the filament during operation, without shorting the filament across adjacent windings. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to lamp filaments generally and, more particularly, to improving support and design of filaments for high energy, radiantly heated semiconductor processing reactors. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a very well known process in the semiconductor industry for forming thin films of materials on substrates and silicon wafers. In a CVD process, gaseous molecules of the material to be deposited are supplied to wafers to form a thin film of that material on wafers by chemical reaction. Such formed thin films may be polycrystalline, amorphous or epitaxial. Typically, CVD processes are conducted at elevated temperatures to accelerate a chemical reaction and to produce high quality films. Some processes, such as epitaxial silicon deposition, are conducted at extremely high temperatures (&gt;900&deg; C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Substrates (e.g., silicon wafers) can be heated using resistance heating, induction heating or radiant heating. Among these, radiant heating is the most efficient technique and, hence, is the currently favored method for certain types of CVD. Radiant heating involves positioning infrared lamps within high-temperature ovens, called reactors. Typically these lamps comprise metal filaments within a quartz or other transparent sleeve. A quartz wall also separates the reaction chamber from the lamps. A susceptor within the reaction chamber typically supports a single substrate and also absorbs the radiant energy to help uniformly heat the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One arrangement of a radiantly heated reactor is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,561, issued Dec. 4, 1990 to Robinson et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In that disclosure, linear infrared lamps are arranged in a pair of crossing arrays, with one orientation above the lamps and an orthogonal orientation below the susceptor. The grid resulting from the crossing array configuration facilitates some control over the temperature uniformity of the wafer by adjusting the power that is delivered to any particular lamp or group of lamps. Additional spot lamps are also employed in the disclosed system of the &apos;561 patent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> During a CVD process, one or more substrates are placed on a wafer support inside a chamber formed within the reactor (i.e., the reaction chamber). Both the wafer and the support are radiantly heated to a desired temperature, while the radiant energy passes through the quartz sleeve and quartz chamber walls such that they remain relatively cool. Accordingly, the reactor is called a &ldquo;cold-wall&rdquo; reactor. Only the wafer (and some supporting elements like the susceptor) are heated to the temperature sufficient to activate the reaction gases. In a typical wafer treatment step, reactant gases are passed over the heated wafer, causing the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of a thin layer of the desired material on the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Radiant heat can likewise be employed for any of a number of other processes in semiconductor fabrication, including, without limitation, etching, dopant diffusion, dopant activation, oxidation, nitridation, silicidation, reorientation anneals, oxide or metal reflow, etc. Furthermore, the heating system of the &apos;561 patent is exemplary only; many other radiant heating systems are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One problem with currently available radiant heating elements is that the lifespan of the lamps is short, causing significant downtime for frequent replacement. Extended use of such lamps, typically including repeated cycling as wafers are sequentially loaded, processed at high temperature and unloaded, leads to lamp failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a need exists for a system for improving lamp lifespan. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a lamp filament support is provided with a filament-contacting portion and at least two sleeve-contacting portions. In the illustrated embodiment, the filament-contacting portion is provided between two sleeve-contacting portions, resembling an H-shaped element in side view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a lamp filament is provided with expansion compensation sections at either end of the central section. The compensation sections have a greater diameter about the filament axis, as compared to the central section, and also have greater spacing between windings. The compensation sections are preferably capable of compressing and absorbing thermal expansion of the filament during operation, without shorting the filament across adjacent windings.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrate sections of lamps for purposes of describing problems and solutions with respect to filament support. FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> illustrate lamps for purposes of describing problems and solutions with respect to filament expansion and contraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The material of a lamp filament used in radiant heating applications is typically tungsten wire, which does not maintain its stiffness at high temperatures. Conventionally, additional spiral support wires, each having a spiral or conical shape, are added around the filament periodically along the filament length to help support the filament, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a quartz lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as might be typically found in a reactor. The quartz lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, spiral filament support <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and quartz sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The support <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> contacts the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at an inner part of its spiral, and buttresses against the quartz sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at an outer part of the spiral. Thus, the support <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is intended to hold the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> away from the quartz sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Unfortunately, this support has been found to tip under operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a side view of a typical lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> illustrating the problem of shorting caused by rotation of the support <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and sagging of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As electricity passes through the resistive filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it begins to glow, and generate heat and light. As the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> nears the melting point of the material of which it is made, the hot filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> begins to sag under gravity. This sagging creates a moment load that tends to tip or rotate the support <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such that it no longer functions to hold up the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sags, adjacent coils of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> grow closer together on the inside curves of the deformed filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and eventually create electrical shorts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> along the filament. These shorts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in turn allow increased electricity to flow through the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, causing its temperature to increase, and exacerbating the filament sagging problem. Eventually, as the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> nears the quartz sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the heat generated by the filament begins to blister or melt the quartz, creating a deformation, blister or hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. At this point, the integrity of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is compromised, and it typically fails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> One proposed solution to this problem has been to &ldquo;trap&rdquo; the filament support <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by providing dimples <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the inner quartz surface into which the support extends, making it more difficult for the support to rotate out of position. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, however, the support <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> still tends to rotate, even with the dimples <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the dimples <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are costly to introduce onto the otherwise smooth quartz sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and also tend to obscure the otherwise clear quartz, possibly affecting radiant heat transmission as well as visual inspection of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of contact portions laterally spaced from one another. In the illustrated embodiment, each support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprises two conical spirals, joined at their apexes. The support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprises one large diameter ring at either end, which contacts the quartz sleeve at two sleeve-contacting portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and a series of smaller diameter rings which support the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at a filament-contacting portion <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. In the side view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> resembles the letter &ldquo;H.&rdquo; However, one skilled in the art will understand that numerous embodiments may be employed. For example, a support resembling the letter &ldquo;X&rdquo; in the side view may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The preferred support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprises tungsten wire having about the same thickness (e.g., within about &plusmn;50% of the thickness) as the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. While the radially-inward filament-contacting portion <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may get hot during operation, the radially-outward sleeve-contacting portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> tend to be cool enough to avoid damage to the quartz sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It will be understood, however, that other materials can also be employed in the construction of the support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> nears the melting point of the material of which it is made, the hot filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> begins to sag under gravity. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in the prior art, this sagging creates a moment load that tends to tip or rotate the support <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such that it no longer functions to hold up the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. However, in the preferred embodiment, the improved support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> does not tip or rotate under the moment. Advantageously, this prevents the filament from excessive sagging, thereby avoiding shorting and melting the quartz sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and consequently extending the working life of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is designed to allow for CVD or other processes typically conducted within a reactor. In particular, the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a 1 kW capacity, more preferably a 3 kW capacity, even more preferably a 6 kW capacity and most preferably a 10 kW capacity. In addition, the reactor (not shown) is preferably capable of achieving a temperature greater than about 500&deg; C., more preferably greater than about 700&deg; C. and most preferably greater than about 900&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown with a plurality of filament supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are spaced along the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thereby holding it within and away from the quartz sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts a schematic side view of a lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, illustrating the effect of thermal expansion upon the lamp filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Conventionally, the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is rigidly connected to electrode contacts at the lateral ends of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is turned on, the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> becomes very hot and expands in accordance with its coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). As the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> heats up, it tends to expand the most in its center portion, marked &ldquo;thermal expansion&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The rigid connections at the lateral ends of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> cause expansion to be absorbed between the closely spaced filament coils and either end of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In particular, the closely spaced coils within the lateral end zones, marked &ldquo;compression&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, can become close enough to short out, as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The shorted coils then exhibit lower resistance and larger current travels through the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, leading to increased heat and further filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expansion. When the power to the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is switched off, the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> cools in place and without commensurate contraction. Consequently, through repeated heating and cooling cycles the problem is exacerbated until the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> melts and the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> fails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a schematic side view of an improved lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provided with a thermal compensation section of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. While illustrated with the novel H-shaped supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> described above, it will be understood that the description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> is applicable to filaments supported by any of a variety of mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> supported within a transparent sleeve, preferably comprising quartz. The filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a wire formed of suitable material, and comprises tungsten in the illustrated embodiment. In a central portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the wire is densely coiled. This dense coiling causes the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to heat up and expand in the central section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. At either end of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is an expansion compensation section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. These expansion compensation sections <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are configured to serve as &ldquo;springs&rdquo; in the sense that they compress more readily without shorting, as compared to the central section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In particular, the expansion compensation sections <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> preferably are formed by coils having a larger diameter and larger spacing (increased pitch) as compared to the central section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the diameter of the expansion compensation sections <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is greater than about 1.5 times, and more preferably greater than about 2.0 times, that of the coil in the central section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the spacing between windings in the expansion compensation section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is preferably greater than about 1.5 times, and more preferably greater than about 2.0 times, that of the coil in the central section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary lamp, the central section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a coil diameter of about 3 mm to 4 mm and coil spacing of about 0.2 mm; however, the skilled artisan can readily apply the teachings herein to filaments of other dimensions. As best seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the length of the expansion compensation section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, as measured along the filament axis, is small compared to the length of the central section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, preferably representing less than about one tenth of the central section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, but each expansion compensation section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> preferably includes at least 2.5 turns or windings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The illustrated expansion compensation section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> comprises integral coils formed from the same wire as the main heater coils in the central section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, no additional parts are required to implement the expansion sections <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>; the formation of windings is simply adapted to include coils of a larger diameter and lower pitch (greater spacing) at the lateral ends of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The skilled artisan will readily appreciate in view of the present disclosure, however, that similar functionality can be obtained with separately formed elements bonded to either end of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, such elements need not necessarily comprise coils but can comprise other devices capable of readily compressing in response to thermal expansion of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and also capable of carrying current to the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Other examples of expansion compensation devices include leaf springs, memory metals in readily compressible configurations, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates the operation of the preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention. As current passes through the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the central portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands (marked &ldquo;thermal expansion&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Preferably, as measured lengthwise, the central portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> comprises at least 70% of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, more preferably, 80% of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and most preferably, 90% of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The expansion of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> causes the expansion compensation sections <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on either end of the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be compressed, as is illustrated in the section marked &ldquo;compression.&rdquo;Advantageously, the expansion compensation sections <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> allow the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to expand while heating, and contract while cooling, thereby allowing the filament <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to retain its original shape. Preferably, after repeated cycling (at least 2,000 cycles), the filament returns to less than 101.5% of its original length, more preferably, 101% of its original length, and most preferably, 100.5% of its original length. Advantageously, the coils of the filament are prevented from shorting, and lamp life is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. Such modifications and changes are intended to fall within the scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
