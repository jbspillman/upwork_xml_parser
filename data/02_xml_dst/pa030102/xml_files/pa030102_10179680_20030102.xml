<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a golf ball placement device for placing golf balls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Golf is a popular sport throughout the world and continues to grow in popularity. Golf is also a demanding sport which requires regular practice in order to maintain and improve the skills of a golfer. In addition to playing rounds of golf on a golf course, golfers often practice regularly by hitting balls at a practicing facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When practicing their driving at a driving range, the golfers must place a golf ball for a shot. Manually placing a golf ball on a tee requires bending of a golfer&apos;s back. This repeated bending to place the ball is tiresome and even potentially hazardous, especially for elderly golfers or golfers with back or weight problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A golf ball placement device provides an efficient and less tiresome method for placing golf balls. Another benefit of the golf ball placement device is that the golfer can maintain his stance and grip in the same position when hitting successive balls. The ability to maintain stance and grip improves concentration and provides a repetitive stroke capability which is often beneficial in a practice session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A number of golf ball placement devices have been developed to assist the golfer in placement up the golf ball during a practice session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,391,446 to Eberle discloses a dispenser with a movable arm maintained in spring tension. The arm pivots in a horizontal plane and includes a dispensing head at the fixed end of the dispenser tube to limit the flow of golf balls into the tube. A golfer must rotate the arm with a club and then tilt or rock the dispensing head forward to release the first ball and then rearward to position the ball on the tee and block the other balls. The golf balls have a tendency to jam up in the hopper and the dispensing head is difficult to coordinate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,318 to Jennings discloses a golf ball storage, dispensing and placement device containing a swing tube which can be pulled down by the golfer through a hook on the swing tube using his golf club head. The golf ball is released because of gravity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A motor driven placement device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,732,391 to Karr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This placement device requires a motor and complex gear assembly to position the arm mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,957,296 and 5,071,131 to Turnidge et al. also disclose a vertical arm for dispensing golf balls. The device includes an operating pedestal and pulley system which moves the arm from an upright position to dispense a golf ball. The device includes an upper and lower golf ball stop to prevent more than one ball at a time from entering the guide track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,995,614 to Tange discloses a vertical arm with a return spring. Tange describes the frequent problem of golf ball jams in the storage hopper of a golf ball placement device. The golf ball dispenser shown in Tange includes internal baffles with a zigzag vertically rising single column to eliminate the possibility of balls jamming in the storage hopper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another golf ball placement device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,326,107 to Park. The arm is motorized and moves only in a horizontal direction. A guide wire is used to maintain the ball on the arm until the ball is positioned above the tee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,325 to Smith discloses a movable channel arm which the golfer must push down to dispense a golf ball. Smith also discloses an agitator, which moves every time a golf ball is dispensed, to prevent golf balls from jamming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Although a number of golf ball placement devices are known, a multitude of mechanisms and installation requirements result in complex operations. The devices are expensive and difficult to maintain such that few golf ball placement device have achieved success in the market place. Many of them are also too heavy and bulky to be portable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an objective of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide a golf ball placement device that is lightweight and portable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is another object of certain embodiments of the invention to provide a golf ball placement device which can position one golf ball at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Another object of certain embodiments of the present invention is to provide a golf ball placement device which can dispense a number of balls from a golf ball container without jamming the balls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A further object of certain embodiments of the present invention is to provide a golf ball placement device which requires a minimum amount of force to be actuated to dispense a golf ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the summary and detailed description of the invention which follow. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a golf ball placement device which contains a housing; a golf ball container located in the housing; a tube for dispensing golf balls attached to the housing, an actuator, and a transmission linkage that links the actuator and the tube. In the device, the actuator is actuated by a golfer using its club head. Due to the transmission linkage, the tube is rotated to place a golf ball. When the actuator is released, the actuator returns to its rest position and consequently the tube also returns to its rest position. The tube then recharges itself with another golf ball from the golf ball container. The transmission linkage that links the tube and the actuator is properly balanced so that it takes a minimum force to actuate the actuator in order to rotate the tube and place a golf ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, a golf ball placement device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings illustrates a fully assembled golf ball placement device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the present invention in the rest position. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, placement device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> attached to the housing, a golf ball container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> located in housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, an actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and other components that are not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of an agitator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (not shown) located in slot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a bottom as well as a tee height adjuster <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows golf ball placement device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with multiple golf balls in its golf ball container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the golf ball placement device during placement of a golf ball when actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is actuated. An important feature of this embodiment of the device of the present invention is that it requires a minimum force, such as the weight of a golf club, to actuate actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a golf ball outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> used for passage of golf balls from container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> show two cross-sectional views of this device. Actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is rigidly linked to one end of lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) via nuts assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Optionally, actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can also be welded to one end of lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> without using nuts assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. When the welding linkage is used to link actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can optionally rotate around shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> without being rigidly linked to shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> inserts its two ends into housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and may or may not be able to rotate freely against housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is pressed down, lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> move around shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by arrow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Another end of lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pivotally linked to one end of an extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The other end of extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pivotally linked with one end of lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The other end of lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rigidly link to shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Both ends of shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are inserted into housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is substantially parallel to shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can rotate against housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. When actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is pressed down by a minimum force, lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> moves in the direction shown by arrow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in turn push lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the same direction to rotate shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rigidly attached to shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. When shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> rotates counter clockwise, tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates with shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to a substantially horizontal position so that a golf ball being hold inside tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will roll out of open end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> onto a golf tee (shown in the dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) due to gravity of the golf ball to complete the placement process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When the force on actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is removed, due to proper weight balancing of tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> all rotate back to their rest positions before actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is pressed down by the minimum force. In the mean time, actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> returns to its rest position before its being pressed down and tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates back to its substantially vertical position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. After rotating to its substantially vertical position, tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which now does not contain a golf ball inside, can accept another golf ball from golf ball container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Due to gravity, another golf ball will roll into the now empty tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through a golf ball outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in golf ball container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and through a ball blocker <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> having an aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 16</cross-reference>) attached on arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> matches outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> when tube is in its substantially vertical position. Only one golf ball will roll into tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> due to the size of tube <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the size of aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Ball blocker <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is closed to additional golf balls from golf ball container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in its substantially horizontal position. Once the golf ball rolls into tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, tube is ready to place the golf ball onto a tee by repeating the above process. During this process of placing a golf ball, only a minimum force is required to press down actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to place a golf ball due to the proper weight balancing of tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are elements of an embodiment of a transmission linkage of the present invention, which is, therefore, properly balanced as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Preferably, extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a proper weight. Extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is further linked to shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through at least one spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at point <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. When actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is pressed down, shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates and lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> moves in the direction shown by arrow <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in turn push lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the same direction to rotate shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. At same time spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> relaxes to counter the weight of extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> because the elongation of spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> decreases during this movement. The retraction force during relaxation of spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is properly adjusted to balance the weight of extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in such a way that a minimum force is required to press down actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in order to rotate shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Preferably, tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a weight component <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), which can optionally be an element of an embodiment of a transmission linkage of the present invention. The weight of the weight component <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> can be adjusted so that a minimum force is required to press down actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The method to adjust the weight of weight component <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> so that a minimum force is required to press down the actuator to dispense a golf ball is well known to a person skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Preferably, tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may have a detachable head <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The dimension of head <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> can be adjusted to suit different driving range dimension, tee height, personal preference or to give a tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a different length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the device of the present invention further includes a tee height adjuster <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), which can adjust the degree of the rotation of tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> based on the height of the tee being used by a golfer. Adjuster <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be a hand adjustable screw with a long shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Adjuster <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has external screw thread on its shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The head of screw <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is screwed into a rotation stopper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is pivotally linked to housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> at one end of rotation stopper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Rotation stopper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has an internal screw thread, which fits the external screw thread on shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Adjuster <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also passes through housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and can rotate freely against housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. When adjuster <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is turned by hand against housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, due to the screw threads on shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and in rotation stopper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can pull or push rotation stopper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to a certain position. The position of rotation stopper <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can limit the movement of extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by block the movement pathway of extension arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at a proper position, therefore, to control the degree of rotation of both shafts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The controlled degree of rotation of shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in turn controls the degree of rotation of tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The height of open end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the end of the rotation of tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thus controlled. Therefore, a golf ball can be properly placed at a controlled height to a golf tee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It is a further embodiment of the present invention that external surface of housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is flat. Therefore, an advertisement can be easily attached to the housing of the device of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a device of the present invention with a place <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> for an advertisement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Preferably the golf ball placement device of the present invention further includes a golf ball agitator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) having a head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and a narrow end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which is described in detail below, pivotally attached to the housing to reduce or prevent golf balls from jamming. During the actuator&apos;s being pressed down process, the actuator also actuates the golf ball agitator to agitate the golf balls in the golf ball container so that the movement of the agitator can reduce or eliminate the chance of ball jamming in this device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Preferably, ball container of the golf ball placement device of the present invention has a slot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> at its bottom so that head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of agitator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can penetrate through slot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect, the present invention relates to a golf ball agitation system which can be used in a golf ball placement device to prevent golf balls from jamming.

Head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of golf ball agitator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is partially inserted through slot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> at the bottom of golf ball container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and can move partially against the container when agitator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is actuated indirectly by actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through the transmission linkage of the present invention. Narrow end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of ball agitator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is pivotally linked to housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> using a nut-bolt assembly <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or other equivalent devices. Head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of ball agitator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be pushed upward by lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates to a certain degree because of the downward movement of actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> returns to its rest position, lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will rotate back to its rest position and head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of ball agitator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will drop back to its rest position. During its being pushed upward and dropping back to its rest position, head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of ball agitator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> moves against ball container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through slot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to agitate the golf balls in golf ball container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to loose the golf balls and prevent the balls from jamming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is a feature of the present invention that the slot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is at the bottom of ball container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which makes the agitation more efficient. Therefore, when agitator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> moves up and down through slot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> at the bottom of ball container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a majority of the golf balls in container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are agitated efficiently.
