<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a fuel system shut-off valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is conventional to use a so-called common rail storage injection system in connection with an internal combustion engine. In such a system, fuel under injection pressure is injected into a combustion chamber of the engine by controlling an injection valve. If the injection valve is defective, this enables the situation in which fuel may leak in uncontrolled fashion into the combustion chamber. To prevent this, the publications U.S. Pat. No. 3,780,716 and WO 95/17594 propose a shut-off valve for limiting the fuel flow volume. The shut-off valve has a cylinder space which contains a piston provided with a spring load acting against the fuel flow direction in an injection situation. In normal operation the fuel amount needed for each injection corresponds to the volume displaced by the piston movement. If for some reason the shut-off valve continues to leak, the piston moves to an extreme position in which it shuts the flow off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In publication GB 2317922 there has been disclosed another shut-off valve for limiting the flow volume. In the initial situation, the pressure acts upon a smaller surface area on the fuel admission side in which case, at a given pressure, the force is naturally smaller being in proportion to the surface area acted upon. However, a disadvantage of this solution is the absolute tightness requirement and consequently it is very sensitive in regard to the fuel quality. If the sealing surface of this smaller surface area leaks, the solution does not work and the pressure is applied to the entire surface area and the piston may move to an extreme position in which it closes the flow. Especially in a large power plant or marine engine the fuel can be such that the solution does not function reliably enough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Also, the prior art flow shut-off valves have generally problems related to situations in which the fuel viscosity is high, for example when heavy fuel oil is used and/or when the fuel temperature before starting the engine is lower than the normal operating temperature. Consequently, the equalization of the fuel pressure over the piston does not occur rapidly enough and the piston may move to an extreme position and close the injection connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a fuel system shut-off valve by which the prior art disadvantages are avoided. An objective of the present invention is especially to provide a shut-off valve by which the unintentional closure on starting phase can be avoided. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention there is provided a fuel system shut-off valve comprising a valve body bounding a fuel space, the valve body having an inlet opening and an outlet opening communicating with the fuel space, a piston assembly in the fuel space and including a main piston member that is movable relative to the valve body and an auxiliary piston member that is movable relative to the main piston member, the piston assembly either allowing or preventing fuel flow through the valve from the inlet opening towards the outlet opening depending on position of the auxiliary piston member, and a force member urging the piston assembly towards the inlet opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the main piston member and the auxiliary piston member have, on the inlet opening side, a first surface area and a second surface area, respectively, bordering the fuel space and the second surface area, formed by the auxiliary piston member, is smaller than the first surface area, formed by the main piston member. The auxiliary piston member is arranged to be movable for providing the closing and opening of the flow connection between the inlet and outlet openings. For this purpose the auxiliary piston member is provided with a sealing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the force member applies force to the auxiliary piston member and this influences the relative positions of the main piston member and the auxiliary piston member. Accordingly, the two piston members are advantageously influenced by a common force member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The fuel space of the shut-off valve is preferably cylindrical and the diameter of the main piston member corresponds substantially to the fuel space diameter. The main piston member has a bore in the direction of its longitudinal axis, and the auxiliary piston member is movably arranged in the bore of the main piston member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The counter surface of the auxiliary piston member sealing surface may be arranged in connection with the outlet opening or in connection with the main piston member, depending on the way the shut-off valve is implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Several advantages are realized using the preferred embodiment of the invention. Firstly, the operation is reliable on starting of the engine. The operation pressure of the shut-off valve auxiliary piston member can easily be dimensioned as desired and, mainly, the operation of the shut-off valve depends only on the pressure. Further, the fuel qualities have only a slight effect on the operation and the presence of possible dirt particles in the fuel does not affect the starting operation.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown very schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the shut-off valve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be adapted to a common rail fuel storage injection system. The common rail storage injection system is conventional and is not described here in detail. The common rail storage injection system includes as its principal components a common rail storage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in which there is fuel under high pressure to be injected into the engine and with which the injection valves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (only one of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are in fluid flow connection for dosing fuel to the cylinders (not shown). From the common rail storage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> there is arranged a fuel channel ductwork <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; for the injection valve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A sufficient pressure is maintained in the common rail storage during the operation to provide an adequate injection pressure to the injection valves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Each injection valve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises control means (not shown) for controlling the injection independently. In the fuel channel ductwork <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; there is arranged a shut-off valve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the operation of which is explained in the following by referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The shut-off valve is shown in its initial state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The shut-off valve includes a body part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> defining a cylindrical fuel space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The fuel space has an inlet opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and an outlet opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for the fuel. In the fuel space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the body part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> there is fitted a piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> comprising an outer or main piston and an inner auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A narrow passage or throttle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> passes through the outer piston and connects the regions of the fuel space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on different sides of the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> with each other. Depending on the position of the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, fuel may either flow through the shut-off valve from the inlet opening to the outlet opening or the fuel flow may be prevented. The shut-off valve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> further comprises a spring <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which urges the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> against a shoulder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; of the body part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In normal running conditions between injections, the shut-off valve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is in the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When the injection valve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> starts the injection during the normal operation, a pressure difference develops over the shut-off valve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in other words between the inlet opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the outlet opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, in which case the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> moves upwards until the injection stops and the pressure difference equalizes. This situation is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In this situation the amount of the fuel to be injected is equivalent to the volume displaced by the movement of the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the fuel space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is movably arranged in connection with the main piston. The main piston has an area <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime; limiting the fuel space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the inlet opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> side of the fuel space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, whereupon the fuel space pressure acts and in normal operation the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> moves with the main piston without relative movement of these two members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the event that the injection valve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> leaks or does not close up for some reason after the injection, the common rail storage pressure pushes the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the extreme position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In this position of the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> the flow into the injection valve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is strongly restricted, because the entire flow goes via the throttle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The pressure difference across the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> increases and when it reaches a specific limit, the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> moves relative to the main piston and the sealing surfaces <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; close up and shut the flow off, which situation is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Here the counter surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sealing surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is arranged in connection with the outlet opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This mode of operation occurs because the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has an area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; bordering a space in the section on the fuel space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> inlet connection <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> side and this area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; is smaller than the corresponding area <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime; of the main piston, in which case primarily a common movement of the main piston and the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> takes place and only when the pressure difference has exceeded a certain limit, such that the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> reaches the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, does the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> move relative to the main piston. Consequently, the pressure moving the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is directed only at the area determined by its diameter and the movement requires a greater pressure than the pressure enabling the movement of the whole piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The shut-off valve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> operates on starting of the engine, for example in a heavy fuel application, as follows. When the fuel circulation is launched before the engine is started up, the pressure of the fuel system effects the inlet opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In this initial situation the outlet opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> side can be almost free of pressure or even full of air. In the next phase the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> moves to the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in other words to its second extreme position. It may be presumed, for example, that the pressure of the fuel system is around 7 bar. The shut-off valve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be dimensioned for example so that the pressure difference needed for moving the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is 25 bar. This means, in practice, that the shut-off valve <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> stays open and the region of the fuel space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the outlet opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> side and the ducting <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; downstream of the shut-off valve are filled from the common rail storage injection system. The pressure at the outlet opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> increases. When the pressures at the inlet opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the outlet opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are sufficiently equalized, the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the shut-off valve moves to the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and the engine can be started without problems. This way the throttle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be dimensioned only according to the desired return speed of the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (in the normal situation when the engine is running). If there is for example a pipe breakage on the outlet opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> side of the shut-off valve when the engine is operating, the shut-off valve closes up immediately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Another shut-off valve embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. This embodiment corresponds otherwise to the one represented in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, but the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been arranged differently to function with the main piston itself as flow closing means. In this embodiment the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> fitted in the bore of the main piston includes a threaded portion that is in threaded engagement with a spring retainer and a lock nut, whereby the auxiliary piston is fixed relative to the spring retainer. The auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also has an enlarged head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;. The channel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> passes through the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and opens at one end into the region of the fuel space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the outlet side of the main piston, and at the other end into the region of the fuel space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the inlet side of the main piston. Now, if the pressure difference across the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> exceeds a specific limit, the auxiliary piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> moves towards the outlet connection, in which case the sealing surfaces <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; end up against each other. Here the movement in question is just about to take place. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the counter surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the auxiliary piston sealing surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is arranged in connection with the piston assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
