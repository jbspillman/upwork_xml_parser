When the main power is turned ON, the power to both the receiver apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A and display apparatus is turned ON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The display apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>B is provided with; an interface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that receives signals from the receiver apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, a scramble cancellation unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that cancels the scramble process performed on the video signal, a panel drive unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that receives the output signal from the scramble cancellation unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a plasma display panel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that is driven by the panel drive unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and displays a specified display, a scramble cancellation control unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that controls the scramble cancellation unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and a sub control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that receives instructions from the main control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and controls the scramble cancellation control unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as well as all of the components of the display apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Also, the interface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the receiver apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A and the interface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for the display apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>B are connected together by a cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have a plurality of lines (for example 60 lines). The video signal that is output from the interface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is transmitted over the cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and input to the interface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be connected or disconnected by way of a connector on the receiver apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A side or display apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the video signal transmission unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of this embodiment will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The process from step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is performed by the main control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The process from step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is performed by the sub control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In steps S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the main control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> determines whether or not a main power-ON detection signal has been output from the power-ON detection unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>or an input change detection signal has output from the input change detection unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>When it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that no detection signal has been output, the process returns to step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and when it is determined that a detection signal has been output, the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the main control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> selects the scramble mode. In this embodiment, there are two modes that use different methods of assigning signals that are output from the output channels (there are six channels in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) of the scramble processing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the scramble processing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> outputs an A-phase signal and B-phase signal for each display color (R, G, B). For each display color, the color signal is provided with both an A-phase signal and B-phase signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For example, the A-phase signal contains data that correspond to the picture elements (R, G and B color picture elements) for the odd rows of the display screen, and the B-phase signal contains data that correspond to the picture elements (R, G and B color picture elements) for the even rows of the display screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The first scramble mode relates each of the signals with the channels based on the output signal from the scramble processing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such that the red (R) A phase, red (R) B phase, green (G) A phase, green (G) B phase, blue (B) A phase and blue (B) B phase are arranged in order from the top to the bottom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. On the other hand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the second scramble method relates each of the signals with the channels such that the display colors for the A phase and B phase are reversed, or in other words, the red (R) B phase, red (R) A phase, green (G) B phase, green (G) A phase, blue (B) B phase and blue (B) A phase are arranged in order from the top to the bottom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the video signal is input to the scramble cancellation unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with the relationship between signals and channels in the output stage of the scramble processing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the main control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> alternately selects the between the first scramble mode and second scramble mode. The previous scramble mode can be stored in a specified memory (for example, non-volatile memory), and in step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the main control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can select a scramble mode that is different than the scramble mode stored in memory. For example, when the first scramble mode is selected the previous time, this time the second scramble mode will be selected. The scramble modes is switched in this way each time the main power is turned ON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Next, in step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the main control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> notifies the sub-control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which scramble mode was selected in step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, then advances to step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the scramble mode that was selected in step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sent to the scramble control unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and then the process returns to step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. By the process of step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the scramble method that is used by the scramble processing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes the method that corresponds to the selected scramble mode (first scramble mode or second scramble mode). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the sub-control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the scramble mode has been sent from the main control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). When it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that the scramble mode has not been sent, the process returns to step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and when it is determined that the scramble mode has been sent, the process advances to step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the sub-control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sends the received scramble mode to the scramble cancellation control unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and then returns to step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. By the process of step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the cancellation method used by the scramble cancellation unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> becomes a method that corresponds to the selected scramble mode, (first scramble mode or second scramble mode). Therefore, it is possible to restore the video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the color signals of the video signal are divided into A-phase and B-phase components, and the channels assigned to the signals are changed, however, it is also possible to switch the upper-order bits and lower-order bits of the video signal and then change the channels assigned to those bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when transmitting data in parallel over eight signal lines for each channel in the case of 8-bit data, channels are assigned for the A phase in order from the top starting from the lowest-order bit, and channels are assigned for the B phase in order from the top starting from the highest-order bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to change the assignment of channels for each of the display color signals. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in the first scramble mode, the output signals from the scramble processing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be arranged in order from the top to bottom as red (R), green (G) and blue (B), and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in the second scramble mode, they can be arranged in order from the top to bottom as blue (B), green (G) and red (R). In other words, in the first scramble mode and second scramble mode, the channels for the red (R) and blue (B) signals are switched with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, two scramble modes were prepared, and the scramble modes were alternately switched each time the main power is turned ON, however, it is also possible to prepare three or more scramble modes and to switch among these scramble modes in order each time the power is turned ON. Also, instead of alternately switching between two scramble modes or switching in order among three or more scramble modes, it is also possible to switch the scramble modes in another pre-determined order. Furthermore, it is also possible to select the scramble mode randomly when the power is turned ON instead of specifying beforehand an order for selecting the scramble mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the scramble mode is changed when it is detected that the main power has been turned ON, however, it is also possible to have separate power supplies for the receiver apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A and display apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>B and to change the scramble mode when either one of the power supplies is turned ON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the case of using a display apparatus having a plasma display panel was explained, however, the present invention is not limited by the kind of apparatus for receiving the video signal, and can be widely applied to various apparatuses for transmitting video signals. Also, in the embodiment the case of using a receiver apparatus was explained, however, the invention is not limited by the kind of apparatus for transmitting video signals and can be widely applied to various apparatuses for transmitting video signals. </paragraph>
