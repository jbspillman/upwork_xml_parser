<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a method for the production on a substrate of gas- and liquid-impermeable layers, which have a relatively high elasticity. This elasticity is attained through the inclusion of carbon in a layer comprised of a metal or semiconductor oxide. In order to attain such an inclusion, a metal or semiconductor is ionized by means of an arc discharge. Subsequently, a reactive gas, for example O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, is introduced, with which the ionized metal or the ionized semiconductor forms an oxide. In addition, a carbon-containing gas is added, which releases its carbon such that on the substrate an oxide layer is formed, in which carbon is included. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method for the production of gas- and liquid-impermeable layers on a substrate. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As a rule, synthetic materials conventionally employed for packaging or as containers are not sufficiently diffusion-tight for volatile substances, such as carbon-based compounds or flavorings and fragrances, as well as for gases, such as hydrocarbons, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapor. This is especially disadvantageous in the case of thin-walled packaging, such as for example films/foils or packaging under gas pressure, which contain, for example, CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-containing refreshment beverages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is therefore known to provide packaging of synthetic material with diffusion barrier layers. Optically transparent barrier layers are produced in known manner by vapor deposition of metal oxides, most often Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or substoichiometric silicon oxide, SiO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, onto the substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, quartz-like SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layers are also produced by a plasma-enhanced chemical gas phase deposition process (PECVD) from an organosilicon compound with an excess of oxygen, such as is found in the publication J. T. Felts: &ldquo;Transparent Gas Barrier Technologies&rdquo;, Society of Vacuum Coaters 33rd Ann. Tech. Conf. Proc. (1990), pp. 184 to 193, and EP 0 299 754 B1. Compared to vapor-deposited SiO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>layers, the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layers produced by means of PECVD processes have a higher optical transparency and a markedly improved barrier effect as well as greater tensile strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The pure SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or SiO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>layers, however, present the disadvantage that they are rather brittle and tear easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It has therefore already been proposed to incorporate carbon into these layers by means of various methods (DE 44 04 690 A1, DE 44 38 359 A1, DE 198 02 506 A1, DE 198 02 333 A1), in order thereby to make the layers more elastic. Most processes, however, do not allow the rapid coating of large quantities, which is required, for example, when coating transparent synthetic material beverage bottles. This applies, for example, to the frequently employed PECVD process (WO 99/19229) and to the CVD process (U.S. Pat. No. 5,641, 559). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The listed processes, moreover, entail disadvantage that, due to the relatively high process gas pressures conventionally applied of 0.1 to 1 mbar, during the coating process high-level impurities are generated in the coating installation and in the vacuum installations. These impurities cause high purification and maintenance expenditures. It is furthermore disadvantageous that due to the process, complexly structured and highly cost-intensive educts must be employed, which after a &ldquo;crack process&rdquo; in a plasma must first be decomposed into the building blocks required for the layer generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition, a process for material coating is known in which the material to be coated is exposed in an underpressure chamber to material vapor, which is generated by means of an arc discharge (EP 0 158 972 B1). Herein the material to be vaporized is connected to the anode of a voltage source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention addresses the problem of producing carbon-containing coatings on substrates with the aid of an arc discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This problem is solved according to the method of the present invention. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention relates specifically to a method for the production of a layer and a layer system producible therewith in a plasma-enhanced gas-phase deposition process, wherein this layer contains an increased carbon fraction and exclusively, or in addition to, the known transparent barrier layers for synthetic films/foils and synthetic containers. The additional carbon originates from a carbon-containing medium, which is in the gaseous state during the plasma discharge in a vacuum and releases the carbon through, for example, ionization. The process can be carried out at relatively low pressures; very few impurities are generated thereby which would disturb the operation of the installation. Moreover, as the carbon carriers highly cost-effective short-chain silicon oils or short-chain hydrocarbon compounds can be employed, which permits the synthesis of the layer from simple and inexpensive starting materials. The additionally incorporated carbon effects primarily an improvement of the elasticity of the layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The advantage attained with the invention comprises in particular that rapid coating becomes possible and the impurities are markedly decreased. In addition, the method according to the invention inhibits the permeation of gaseous and/or liquid substances, in particular of hydrocarbons, oxygen, water vapor and of CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, through the coated substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the invention, in addition to the starting materials conventionally employed in the case of anodic arc vaporization, including the cathode materials, for the required carbon-containing and in gaseous form under pressure carrier medium of the carbon to be incorporated in the barrier layer a cost-effective educt, preferably short-chain silicon oils, for example HMDSO (hexamethyl disiloxane), TMDS (tetramethyl disiloxane) and their derivatives, or short-chain hydrocarbon compounds with single, double and triple bonds, for example methane, ethane, ethene or acetylene are employed. Through the use of these simple and not cost-intensive starting products, the production and the structure of the carbon-containing layer in the form of a synthesis, i.e. specific supply of the required components for the barrier layer to be generated as molecules and atoms from the primary components oxygen, silicon and carbon, can take place much more economically than has previously been possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention also improves significantly the effect of such barrier layers on hollow bodies of synthetic material, which are subjected to increased thermal loading cycles, for example higher temperatures and higher relative humidity, as well as also their resistance to abrasive wear-and-tear which has a favorable effect on durability, for example, in automatic bottling installations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention will be explained in conjunction with the drawings described in the following.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the principle of a coating installation is shown, with which the method according to the invention is carried out. This coating installation comprises a vacuum treatment chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in which is disposed a rotatable receiving device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for a hollow body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be coated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> This hollow body can be a bottle comprised of a transparent synthetic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Underneath this hollow body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is disposed a gas inlet tube <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, via which a carbon-containing gas and, if appropriate, a reactive gas is introduced into the vacuum treatment chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Underneath the horizontally extending portion of the gas inlet tube are disposed two electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which preferably are at the negative potential of a (not shown) voltage source. Underneath these electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which can be magnesium electrodes, is disposed a vaporization crucible <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which can be heated in a heater <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and in which is disposed a coating material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be vaporized. About the vaporization crucible <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the heater <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided a thermal insulation <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The coating distance is approximately 25 to 50 cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> If a DC voltage of, for example, 24 V is applied between electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; and vaporization crucible <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, with appropriate material in crucible <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and with appropriate distance between the electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; and the coating material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in crucible <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> an arc discharge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> forms. In order to attain reliable ignition of the arc discharge, at the beginning an ignition aid known per se, for example in the form of a &lsqb;spark gap&rsqb; ignition pin can also be employed, which is at positive potential, or by generating a plasma above the material to be vaporized with means known per se. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Through the arc discharge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the coating material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the vaporization crucible <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is vaporized and ionized. Consequently, above the vaporization crucible an ionized vaporization lobe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> develops. If the vaporized material is, for example, silicon and if, via the gas inlet tube <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a mixture of O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and HMDSO is introduced, the silicon combines with the oxygen and the HMDSO dissociates and releases carbon. Onto the rotating hollow body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> subsequently a mixture of carbon and SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or SiO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is transported and forms here a layer which is transparent and has strong adhesion properties. The adhesion is brought about by physical and/or chemical bonding forces between the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or SiO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>and the carbon. The inclusion of the carbon can lead to various matrices, depending on the type and quantity of material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the case of relatively large quantities of material in the vaporization crucible, it can occur that the arc discharge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> alone does not suffice to bring about vaporization. In this case the heater <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is connected as additional heating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts a substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, on which a high carbon-content layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was applied with the above described method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is depicted a substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with two layers, with the first layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> again being a high carbon-content layer and the second layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> a standard layer comprised of, for example, SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or SiO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>. The second layer can also be applied with the installation depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on which three layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are applied, wherein the first layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a conventional standard barrier layer, for example of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the second layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a high carbon-content layer and the third layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is a protective layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A base layer can additionally be introduced between the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the first layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The alternating coating with standard layer and high carbon-content layer can be repeated any number of times and each layer type can represent the beginning as the first layer on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is furthermore possible to apply optionally additionally a first base layer and/or as a terminal layer an upper cover layer with a different layer matrix in each instance. By matrix is herein understood a material which comprises another substance as an inclusion, for example SiO which includes C. The type of this inclusion can be different, and specifically as a function of the employed materials, their concentration and the distances between the vaporization crucible, the gas inlet tube and the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Although the method is preferably carried out with the aid of a DC arc discharge, it is also possible to utilize an AC arc discharge. </paragraph>
