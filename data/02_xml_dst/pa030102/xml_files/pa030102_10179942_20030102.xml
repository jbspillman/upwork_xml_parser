<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention provides a clutch connection method which controls the disconnection/connection of a wet friction clutch on the basis of a duty pulse outputted from an electronic control unit. When the clutch is connected, the electronic control unit initially outputs a start duty (Dst) for largely connecting the clutch as far as the vicinity of a torque point, and, thereafter, outputs, at prescribed time intervals (&Dgr;t), a gradual connection duty (Dk) for gradually connecting the clutch, and determines a gradual connection duty value on the basis of a clutch input/output side revolution difference &Dgr;N. Since the clutch is gradually connected while monitoring the clutch connection state, variations between connection times and connection shock, resulting from individual clutch differences or the like, can be eliminated, whereby it is possible to achieve a stable feel. Further, in control which connects the clutch in sync with completion of a transmission gear shift, a plurality of clutch connection modes (an engine plus mode, an in-shaft plus mode, and a synchro mode) are preset, and the clutch connection modes are selected in accordance with the size of clutch input-side and output-side revolution numbers upon completion of a gear shift. Clutch connection is performed which conforms to actual conditions since a clutch connection mode is selected in accordance with the size of clutch input/output side revolution numbers rather than with respect to a shift-up or a shift-down. </paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a clutch control method, and more particularly to a method for controlling the connection/disconnection of a wet friction clutch which is provided in a power transmission system of a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have newly developed a vehicle power transmission device, in which a fluid coupling capable of being locked up (including a torque converter) and a wet friction clutch are serially provided between the engine and transmission, and which automatically connects and disconnects the wet friction clutch during transmission. Here, if the vehicle is put into gear while stationary, the clutch is subsequently automatically connected, and creep is generated thereby. This point is similar to an ordinary AT (Automatic Transmission) vehicle. On the other hand, while the vehicle is traveling after starting off, the fluid coupling is locked up, and the clutch is automatically disconnected/connected at each transmission gear shift. This point is similar to an ordinary MT vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When connection of the clutch is too rapid, this produces a clutch connection shock (so-called &ldquo;garage shock&rdquo; or similar), and when the clutch connection is too slow, it takes time from the gear-in operation until the generation of creep, and the driver does not know when to step on the accelerator (large time lag). Therefore, for the purpose of achieving compatibility between clutch connection shock and a shortening of the connection time, control is performed such that the clutch is rapidly connected in an idle region up until when the clutch begins to connect, and is slowly connected by switching the connection speed once the clutch begins to connect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the working fluid pressure for driving the disconnection/connection of the clutch is changed in accordance with a duty pulse outputted from an electronic control unit, and, when connecting the clutch from a disconnected state, a prescribed start duty for largely connecting the clutch as far as the vicinity of the position in which the clutch begins to connect is initially outputted from the electronic control unit (this will be referred to as a single connection), and, thereafter, a prescribed gradual connection duty for gradually connecting the clutch is outputted from the electronic control unit at prescribed time intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The position in which the clutch begins to connect, i.e. the torque transmission start point at which it is initially possible to transmit a prescribed torque, is known as the &ldquo;torque point&rdquo;, and this torque point is utilized, for example, as a connection speed switching point, by making the control unit learn this torque point. This torque point is taken as a learning value since variations or individual differences exist between clutches which are caused by production errors or similar, and the torque point is different for each clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, at the start of development, clutch gradual connection control was open-loop control which outputted a gradual connection duty according to a predetermined schedule. However, as a result of individual differences, such as variations in the torque point learning value, in the clutch characteristics, or in the oil temperature, and the like, and/or deviations in the usage conditions, problems occurred such as the generation of clutch connection shock or a long connection time, which in turn resulted in the inconvenience of an unstable feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, with regard to clutch connection control at the time of a gear shift while the vehicle is traveling, at the start of development, shift-up and shift-down clutch connection modes were preset, and such modes were used properly according to whether a shift-up or a shift-down was actually performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, it was established that it is insufficient to simply modify the clutch connection method in terms of only a shift-up or a shift-down. For example, when shifting down from third gear to second gear, it is ordinarily sufficient to connect the clutch in accordance with a shift-down mode following a gear shift to second gear. However, when the clutch is connected by putting the vehicle into neutral from third gear, and then into second gear after coasting a short while until the vehicle speed has dropped sufficiently, there are also times when a better feel is afforded by connecting the clutch in accordance with a shift-up mode instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a method in which proper usage of clutch connection modes is made using only a judgement of a shift-up or a shift-down is limited in its conformance with a clutch connection feel in all conditions, and, depending on the conditions, there are cases where a clutch connection shock, a connection time lag, and the like, are produced. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention was therefore devised in view of the problems above, an object thereof being to achieve compatibility between connection shock and connection time during clutch gradual connection, and to thereby achieve a stable feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is a further object of the present invention to obtain, with regard to clutch connection control at the time of a gear shift, a suitable clutch connection feel under any conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a clutch control method for controlling connection/disconnection of a clutch by changing the working fluid pressure for driving the connection/disconnection of a wet friction clutch in accordance with a duty pulse outputted from an electronic control unit, according to which method, when connecting the clutch from a disconnected state, a prescribed start duty for largely connecting the clutch as far as the vicinity of a torque point is initially outputted from the electronic control unit, and, thereafter, a prescribed gradual connection duty for gradually connecting the clutch is outputted from the electronic control unit at prescribed time intervals, and a gradual connection duty value at each prescribed time interval is determined on the basis of a clutch input/output side revolution difference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, since the clutch can be gradually connected while continually monitoring the clutch connection state, variations between connection times and connection shock resulting from individual clutch differences or the like, can be eliminated, whereby it is possible to achieve a stable feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Here, the above-mentioned wet friction clutch is between the engine and the transmission and serially provided downstream of the fluid coupling capable of lockup, and the above-mentioned clutch input/output side revolution difference is preferably determined based on the engine revolution number when the fluid coupling is locked up, and the transmission input shaft revolution number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further, the above-mentioned clutch input/output side revolution difference is preferably a value produced by subtracting the input shaft revolution number from the engine revolution number for a shift-up case, and, by subtracting the engine revolution number from the input shaft revolution number for a shift-down case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The gradual connection duty value at prescribed time intervals mentioned above is calculated by adding or subtracting a step duty, determined on the basis of the above clutch input/output side revolution difference, with respect to the previous gradual connection duty value, and two types are preferably set for this step duty value at least for a shift-up case and for a shift-down case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The step duty value mentioned above is preferably selected from a map whose parameters are taken to be the transmission gear level and the clutch input/output side revolution difference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the course of the gradual connection duty output, if the clutch input/output side revolution difference reaches or becomes lower than a prescribed value, a duty corresponding to a complete connection of the clutch is preferably outputted by the above electronic control unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention is a clutch control method for controlling connection/disconnection of the clutch in accordance with a duty pulse which is outputted from an electronic control unit, in a vehicle power transmission device in which a wet friction clutch is provided midway along a power transmission path extending from the engine to the transmission, which method commences clutch connection control at the same time as the transmission is geared in to a next gear shift level during a gear shift while the vehicle is traveling; and, thereafter, during clutch gradual connection control, if the clutch input/output side revolution difference reaches or becomes lower than a prescribed value, a duty corresponding to a complete connection of the clutch is outputted from the above electronic control unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Here, a fluid coupling capable of lockup is provided upstream of the wet friction clutch in the power transmission path; the clutch input-side revolution number is the engine revolution number during lockup of the fluid coupling, and the clutch output-side revolution number is the transmission input shaft revolution number, and, the revolution difference is preferably a value produced by subtracting the input shaft revolution number from the engine revolution number for a shift-up case, and, by subtracting the engine revolution number from the input shaft revolution number for a shift-down case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a method, which, by means of an electronic control unit, disconnects a clutch in sync with the start of a transmission gear shift, and connects the clutch in sync with completion of the transmission gear shift, wherein, with regard to clutch connection control, a plurality of clutch connection modes are preset, and the clutch connection modes are selected in accordance with the size of a clutch input-side revolution number and output-side revolution number upon completion of a gear shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, clutch connection is performed which conforms to actual conditions since a clutch connection mode is selected in accordance with the size of clutch input/output side revolution numbers rather than for a shift-up or a shift-down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Here, it is preferable that the clutch should be provided serially downstream of a fluid coupling capable of lockup which is between the engine and the transmission; that the clutch input-side revolution number should be an engine revolution number upon lockup of the fluid coupling; and that the clutch output-side revolution number should be a transmission input shaft revolution number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is preferable that the plurality of clutch connection modes should comprise a first mode, which is applied when a revolution difference, which is obtained by subtracting the clutch output-side revolution number from the clutch input-side revolution number upon gear shift completion, is equal to or greater than a positive first prescribed value; a second mode, which is applied when the revolution difference is equal to or less than a negative second prescribed value; and a third mode, which is applied when the revolution difference is smaller than the positive first prescribed value and is greater than the negative second prescribed value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Further, it is preferable that the clutch should be controlled by being disconnected/connected in accordance with a duty pulse outputted from the electronic control unit; that, when performing clutch connection control, the electronic control unit should initially output a prescribed start duty for largely connecting the clutch as far as the vicinity of a torque point, and, thereafter, should output, at prescribed time intervals, a prescribed gradual connection duty for gradually connecting the clutch, and should determine a gradual connection duty value at each prescribed time interval on the basis of a clutch input/output side revolution difference; and that the start duty and the gradual connection duty should be determined in each respective clutch connection mode.</paragraph>

Also, upon spline-engaging the sleeve S/<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which has been spline-engaged with the hub H/<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> fixed to the output shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, with the dog D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the second main gear M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the output shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> rotates in sympathy with the second gear, and, upon spline-engaging the sleeve S/<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> with the dog D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the third main gear M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the output shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> rotates in sympathy with the third gear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Further, upon spline-engaging the sleeve S/<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, which has been spline-engaged with a hub H/<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which is fixed to the output shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, with the dog D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the fourth main gear M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the output shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> rotates in sympathy with the fourth gear, and, when the sleeve S/<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is spline-engaged with the dog D<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the input main gear <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the output shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> rotates in sympathy with (directly with) the fifth gear. Also, upon spline-engaging the sleeve S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which has been spline-engaged with a hub H<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which is fixed to the counter shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with the dog D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the sixth secondary gear C<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the output shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> rotates in sympathy with the sixth gear. Each of the sleeves above is manually operated using a shift lever inside the cab via a shift fork and shift rod not shown in the figure. In other words, transmission T/M is a manual type transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The wet multi-plate clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has an ordinary constitution. In other words, although not illustrated in the figures, each of a plurality of mutually different clutch plates are spline-engaged with the input and output sides within the clutch casing which is filled with oil, and the connection/disconnection of the clutch is performed by pressing together or releasing these clutch plates by means of a clutch piston. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the clutch piston <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is constantly biased toward the disconnection side by the clutch spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and when an oil pressure exceeding such biasing is applied to the clutch piston <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is linked. The clutch linkage force and the torque capacity of the clutch increase in accordance with the oil pressure applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Next, an oil pressure supply device for supplying a working oil pressure to the wet multi-plate clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the oil in an oil tank <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is drawn in and discharged by the oil pressure pump OP via a filter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the discharge pressure of the oil is adjusted using a relief valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in order to create a constant line pressure PL. The oil of this line pressure PL is fed to the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by controlling the pressure (depressurization), and, for this purpose, two valves, namely a clutch control valve CCV and a clutch solenoid valve CSV, are employed. In other words, a piloted oil pressure control system is adopted in which the clutch control valve CCV connected to the main oil pressure line is opened and closed in accordance with the piloted oil pressure Pp delivered from the clutch solenoid valve CSV. In addition, the size of the piloted oil pressure Pp is changed in accordance with the duty pulse outputted from the electronic control unit (termed ECU hereinafter) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In other words, the clutch solenoid valve CSV is an electromagnetic valve having an electromagnetic solenoid, and which, as well as being capable of opening/closing seamlessly, supplies the line pressure PL continually. Further, the clutch solenoid valve CSV receives the duty pulse outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and causes the valve to open by an amount corresponding to the corresponding duty (duty ratio) D. Thus, the clutch solenoid valve CSV then outputs the piloted oil pressure Pp in accordance with the duty D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The clutch control valve CCV is a spool valve capable of being controlled seamlessly on the basis of the piloted oil pressure Pp, and is itself not electronically controlled. In other words, an internal spool is stroked open in accordance with the size of the piloted oil pressure Pp, and the line pressure PL is thus suitably adjusted and delivered to the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a clutch pressure Pc. The oil pressure supplied to the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is consequently duty-controlled by means of the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Further, an accumulator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is provided midway along the path connecting the clutch solenoid valve CSV and the clutch control valve CCV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a characteristic line diagram for an oil pressure supply device. The horizontal axis represents the duty D of the duty pulse outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and more particularly is an ON duty that indicates a percentage of the solenoid ON time in the basic control cycle (20 msec in the present embodiment). In the present embodiment, the clutch is completely connected when the duty D is 0(%). This is so that the clutch is in a connected state and it is thus possible to maintain vehicle travel one way or another even when electricity no longer flows to the clutch solenoid valve CSV (so-called off stack state) due to faults with an electrical system, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in the diagram, the larger the duty D, the greater the disconnection, and the smaller the duty D, the greater the connection. The diagram shows a tendency according to which, as the value of the duty D becomes smaller, the value of the piloted oil pressure Pp, which is outputted from the clutch control valve CCV, increases proportionally, and, accordingly, the oil pressure, that is, the clutch pressure Pc supplied to the clutch, and the torque capacity Tc of the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> increase proportionally. Further, the valve opening degree V of the clutch control valve CCV is in three positions in the diagram, but, in reality, the spool valve makes a small stroke when opened completely or at an intermediate degree of opening other than when completely closed (the valve opening degree is 0 mm in the diagram), and the clutch pressure Pc can be continuously changed thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Though a control system for the lockup clutch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> also exists in the present embodiment, a description thereof is omitted here since such control system does not directly relate to the present invention. The constitution of this oil pressure control system is largely the same as that for the oil pressure control system of the wet multi-plate clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Next, an electronic control device for electronically controlling a power transmission device will be described using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In addition to the clutch solenoid valve CSV, a variety of switches and sensors, and the like, for electronically controlling the present device, are connected to the above-described ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. These include an engine revolution sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for detecting the engine revolution number; a turbine revolution sensor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for detecting the revolution number of the input side of the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, that is, the revolution number of the turbine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>; a transmission revolution sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for detecting the revolution number of the transmission T/M, and the revolution number of the input secondary gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> representatively; and a vehicle speed sensor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for detecting the vehicle speed. These sensors are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. More particularly, the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> calculates the revolution number of the input shaft <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from the output of the transmission revolution sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and from the gear ratio between the input main gear <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the input secondary gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and this is taken to be the revolution number on the output side of the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In other words, the means for detecting the revolution number on the clutch output side is the transmission revolution sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Further, a parking brake switch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for detecting whether or not the parking brake is being operated, a foot brake switch <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for detecting whether or not the foot brake is being operated, and a gear position sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for detecting the transmission gear position, are also connected to the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A knob switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is also connected to the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In other words, in the present-embodiment, in order to detect the start time of a gear shift operation by the driver, or to determine the timing for the start of clutch disconnection, a shift knob is attached so as to be capable of turning slightly in a gear shift direction with respect to the cab shift lever, and a knob switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is provided between this lever and shift knob. Further, when the shift knob turns before the movement of the lever at the time of a gear shift operation by the driver, the knob switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is turned ON, which is taken as a signal for the start of clutch disconnection. The specific constitution is like that shown in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H11-236931. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Also, a hill start auxiliary device (HSA; Hill Start Aid) of the kind illustrated in the same publication above is provided in the power transmission device of the present embodiment, and an HSA switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for manually turning this device ON/OFF is provided in the driver&apos;s cab, this HSA switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> being connected to the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation and control method of the power transmission device of the present embodiment will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> According to this power transmission device, the power of the engine E is transmitted in order to the fluid coupling <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the wet multi-plate clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the transmission T/M. In principle, the lockup clutch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is continually ON (connected) after the vehicle has started traveling and OFF (disconnected) when the vehicle is stationary and when the vehicle starts to travel. Consequently, the creep of the fluid coupling <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be utilized at the time the vehicle starts traveling as is the case for an AT vehicle, and, in comparison to performing electronic start-off control of the friction clutch, control is then simple, and it is possible to prevent loss produced by slippage since the fluid coupling <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is locked up while the vehicle is traveling. The wet multi-plate clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is disconnected each time a gear shift takes place. This is the same as for an ordinary MT vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Here, to describe the control of connection/disconnection of the lockup clutch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in detail, the lockup clutch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is connected at or higher than a prescribed speed (approximately 10 km/h in the present embodiment) which is a relatively low vehicle speed. More precisely, the connection of the lockup clutch is made in each gear level when the input shaft revolution number reaches or becomes higher than a prescribed revolution number (uniformly 900 rpm in the present embodiment). The vehicle starts traveling at a starting gear level (for example, second gear, which is widely used as a starting gear level), and, when the input shaft revolution number reaches the prescribed revolution number (900 rpm), the lockup clutch is connected, and, at such time, the vehicle speed is low (approximately 10 km/h). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> First, operation at the time the vehicle starts traveling will be described. Let us assume that, while the vehicle is stationary and in neutral, the driver operates the shift lever to a starting gear level to start traveling. Then, in the shift lever, as a result of the shift knob turning before the movement of the lever, the knob switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is turned ON, which is taken as a signal to segment the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Further, the transmission T/M is put into gear at a starting gear level as a result of the shift lever being operated subsequently, and the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected when this gear shift is detected by the gear position sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Since the turbine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is stopped from the drive wheel side as a result of this connection, the pump <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> slides against the turbine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and creep is generated thereby. Consequently, thereafter, upon releasing the brake or stepping on the accelerator, and so forth, the vehicle starts to move. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation at the time of a gear shift while the vehicle is traveling will be described. Let us assume that, when the vehicle is traveling with a prescribed gear level, the driver operates the shift lever to the next gear shift level to change gear. Then, the shift knob turns before the movement of the lever and the knob switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is turned ON, which is taken as a signal to segment the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The transmission T/M is geared in to the next gear shift level as a result of the shift lever being operated further, and the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected when this gear shift is detected by the gear position sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The gear shift is thus complete. The lockup clutch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> remains ON during the gear shift, and the engine power is transmitted to the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Next, the clutch control methods according to the present embodiments will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;First Control Method&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The clutch control method while the vehicle is traveling will now be described using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is for a shift-up case, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is for a shift-down case. A description will be provided first for a shift-up case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the clutch is completely disconnected as a result of the knob switch being ON (t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), and when the shift lever is operated for the next gear shift level, clutch connection commences (t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> First of all, single connection control is executed. In other words, a start duty (single connection duty) Dst for largely connecting the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as far as the vicinity of the torque point is outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The start duty Dst of the present embodiment is 10(%) when the temperature is normal and 60(%) when the temperature is low. An invalid stroke (idle stroke) of the clutch piston <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is present in the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the start of connection, but, by means of single connection control, a rapid connection is made for this invalid stroke, which in turn permits a shortening of the connection time. Here, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the start duty Dst&equals;10(%) when the temperature is normal is a value that corresponds to the complete connection of the clutch, but the output time interval for this start duty is minimal (0.1 sec in the present embodiment), and, conversely, when such an excessive duty is outputted for a short time, the clutch piston <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is made to move more rapidly, which permits further shortening of the connection time. After the start duty Dst of the value thus determined has been outputted for a fixed time interval, single connection control becomes open loop control. The clutch torque point is the learning value, and when the duty value has been obtained, same is stored in the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> duty D&equals;50(%), which indicates torque capacity Tcm&equals;approximately 200 (Nm), is the torque point learning value. When there is deviation in the torque capacity line diagram as shown by the broken line due to variations in the clutch or the like, the torque point learning value also changes accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, once the outputting of the start duty Dst ends, a transition is made to clutch gradual connection control(t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). In other words, a gradual connection duty Dk for gradually connecting the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at prescribed time intervals. The prescribed time interval as used here in the present embodiment is equal to a control cycle &Dgr;t&equals;20 msec, but may also be equal to control cycles n&Dgr;t equivalent to a plurality of cycles. Hereinbelow, this prescribed time interval is referred to as a gradual connection cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A characterizing feature of this gradual connection control is that the value of each gradual connection duty for each gradual connection cycle is determined on the basis of the clutch input/output revolution difference. The value of the engine revolution number detected by the engine revolution sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is employed as the clutch input side revolution number. This is because, while the vehicle is traveling, the lockup clutch is connected and it is considered that the clutch input-side revolution number&equals;the engine revolution number. As the clutch output-side revolution number, the value of the input shaft revolution number which is calculated from the output of the transmission revolution sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the gear ratio, as described hereinabove, is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Since a shift-up is made here, the engine revolution number Ne is higher than the input shaft revolution number Ni, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The revolution difference &Dgr;N is therefore calculated by subtracting the input shaft revolution number Ni from the engine revolution number Ne (&Dgr;N&equals;Ne&minus;Ni). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, for each transmission gear level, the value of the step duty Ds with respect to the revolution difference &Dgr;N is set using a map format. This step duty calculaton map is stored in the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The specific details of clutch gradual connection control are as provided hereinbelow. First, in the gradual connection cycle of time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> constituting an initial value is outputted. Then, the revolution difference &Dgr;N3 at this time is calculated, and a step duty Ds<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is determined according to the map in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> from the current gear level and the value of &Dgr;N3. Then, in the gradual connection cycle of time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is the next control cycle, a value produced by subtracting the step duty Ds<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the previous gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made the present gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and is outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, similarly, a revolution difference &Dgr;Nn is calculated in the gradual connection cycles of times tn (n&equals;4, 5, 6 . . . ), and a step duty Dsn is determined according to the map in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and in the gradual connection cycle of a time tn&plus;1, which is the next control cycle, the step duty Dsn is subtracted from the previous gradual connection duty Dkn and is made the present gradual connection duty Dkn&plus;1, and is outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. By repeating such control, the clutch is connected a little at a time, and the revolution difference &Dgr;N grows steadily smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The step duty Ds calculation cycle and the control cycle At need not necessarily be equal. At such time, each time the step duty Ds is calculated, the gradual connection duty Dk is updated, and this update cycle constitutes the gradual connection cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Thus, if prescribed gradual connection end conditions exist, the gradual connection control ends, and a transition is made to clutch rapid connection control. The gradual connection end conditions of the present embodiment are that the revolution difference &Dgr;N is a small value and equal to or less than 150 rpm, or that the duty outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> reaches a gradual connection end duty De which is a value for when the clutch is adequately connected. In clutch rapid connection control, the rapid connection duty&equals;0 and this is outputted for a prescribed time interval equal to 0.3 sec. Then, thereafter, clutch complete connection control is performed to thereby end the clutch connection control. Similarly in clutch complete connection control, the complete connection duty&equals;0, and this is outputted for a prescribed time interval equal to 1 sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A description follows using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</cross-reference> for a shift-down case. Clutch control is largely the same at the time of a shift-down and a shift-up. A point of difference is that, at the time of a shift-down, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, since the input shaft revolution number Ni is higher that the engine revolution number Ne, calculation of the revolution difference &Dgr;N is also reversed in that the revolution difference &Dgr;N is calculated by subtracting the engine revolution number Ne from the input shaft revolution number Ni (&Dgr;N&equals;Ni&minus;Ne). Another point of difference is that values for the step duty Ds are set separately from a shift-up case, more specifically, a shift-down step duty calculation map of the kind shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is prepared separately. In this map, values are suited to shift-down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Details of further clutch connection control are the same as provided above. In gradual connection control, the gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> constituting an initial value is outputted in the gradual connection cycle of time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the revolution difference &Dgr;N3 is calculated, and the step duty Ds<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is determined according to the map in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> from the present gear level and the value of &Dgr;N3. Then, in the gradual connection cycle of time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is the next control cycle, a value produced by subtracting the step duty Ds<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the previous gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made the present gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and is outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, by repeating such a process, the clutch is connected a little at a time. The subsequent clutch rapid connection control and clutch complete connection control are performed in the same way as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As described hereinabove, in the present embodiment, at the time of clutch gradual connection, since control, by which the clutch is connected while continually observing the actual connection status, that is, the clutch input/output revolution difference, is executed instead of performing open loop control by which a connection is made in accordance with a predetermined schedule, it is possible to suit the control to individual clutch differences such as variations in the torque point learning value, in the clutch characteristics, or in the oil temperature, and the like, and/or to deviations in the usage conditions, to thereby continually achieve compatibility between connection shock and connection time, such that variations in the feel caused by the above-mentioned variations can be resolved and it is possible to achieve a stable feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Also, since two types of step duty are set for a shift-up and a shift-down, clutch gradual connection can be performed to suit a shift-up and a shift-down respectively. In addition, since a step duty is set for each gear level, it is possible to perform a gradual connection of the clutch which is suited to each gear level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to or by the embodiment described hereinabove. In the embodiment above, the duty reduction direction was made the clutch connection direction, but the reverse direction is also possible. At such time, the present gradual connection duty is determined by adding the step duty to the previous gradual connection duty such that the gradual connection duty steadily increases. The wet friction clutch in the present invention is a multi-plate clutch in the above embodiment but may also be single-plate clutch, for example. Also, the fluid pressure in the present invention is an oil pressure in the above embodiment but may also be another fluid pressure such as an air pressure. The transmission in the present invention is an ordinary meshing manual transmission in the embodiment above, but may also be an ordinary meshing automatic transmission (equipped with an auto shifter) or a planet gear automatic transmission as in an AT vehicle, for example. Any engine type is possible, such as a diesel engine, kerosene engine, and so forth. The present invention can also be applied to a power transmission device without a concomitant fluid coupling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As described hereinabove, with the present invention, excellent effects are exhibited, namely that of permitting compatibility between connection time and connection shock during gradual connection of the clutch irrespective of individual differences between clutches and the like and/or of differences in the usage conditions, and that of making it possible to achieve a stable feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Second Control Method&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The clutch control method while the vehicle is traveling will now be described using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is a representative shift-up example, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is a representative shift-down example. A shift-up example will be described first. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the clutch is completely disconnected as a result of the knob switch being ON (t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), and when the shift lever is operated for the next gear shift level, clutch connection commences (t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). At the same time as the vehicle is put into gear, a comparison between the previous gear level and the current gear level is conducted and a judgement is made of a shift-up or a shift-down A shift-up is considered here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Further, clutch connection mode selection is performed separately at the same time as the vehicle is put into gear. This will be described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Single connection control is initially executed for the clutch connection. In other words, a start duty (single connection duty) Dst for largely connecting the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as far as the vicinity of the torque point is outputted for a fixed time interval (0.1 sec in the present embodiment) from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The start duty Dst of the present embodiment is 10(%) when the temperature is normal and 60(%) when the temperature is low. An invalid stroke (idle stroke) of the clutch piston <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is present in the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the start of connection, but, by means of single connection control, a rapid connection is made for this invalid stroke, which in turn permits a shortening of the connection time. Here, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the start duty Dst&equals;10(%) when the temperature is normal is a value that corresponds to the complete connection of the clutch, but the output time interval for this start duty is minimal (0.1 sec in the present embodiment), and, conversely, when such an excessive duty is outputted for a short time, the clutch piston <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is made to move more rapidly, which permits further shortening of the connection time. The clutch torque point is the learning value, and when the duty value has been obtained, same is stored in the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> duty D&equals;50(%), which indicates torque capacity Tcm&equals;approximately 200 (Nm), is the torque point learning value. When there is deviation in the torque capacity line diagram as shown by the broken line due to variations in the clutch or the like, the torque point learning value also changes accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, once the outputting of the start duty Dst ends, a transition is made to clutch gradual connection control (t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). In other words, a gradual connection duty Dk for gradually connecting the clutch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at prescribed time intervals. The prescribed time interval as used here in the present embodiment is equal to a control cycle &Dgr;t&equals;20 msec, but may also be equal to control cycles n&Dgr;t equivalent to a plurality of cycles. Hereinbelow, this prescribed time interval is referred to as a gradual connection cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In gradual connection control, the value of the gradual connection duty for each gradual connection cycle is determined on the basis of the clutch input/output revolution difference. The value of the engine revolution number detected by the engine revolution sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is employed as the clutch input side revolution number. This is because, while the vehicle is traveling, the lockup clutch is connected and it is considered that the clutch input-side revolution number&equals;the engine revolution number. However, the turbine revolution number may also be used. As the clutch output-side revolution number, the value of the input shaft revolution number which is calculated from the output of the transmission revolution sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the gear ratio, as described hereinabove, is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A shift-up example will be considered here. The engine revolution number Ne is higher than the input shaft revolution number Ni, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> calculates a revolution difference &Dgr;N by subtracting an input shaft revolution number Ni from an engine revolution number Ne (&Dgr;N&equals;Ne&minus;Ni), based on a shift-up judgement which is made at time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> More detail will be provided hereinafter, but, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the value of a step duty Ds with respect to the revolution difference &Dgr;N is set, using a map format, for each transmission gear level. This step duty calculation map is stored in the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The specific details of clutch gradual connection control are as provided hereinbelow. First, in the gradual connection cycle of time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> constituting an initial value is outputted. Then, the revolution difference &Dgr;N3 at this time is calculated, and a step duty Ds<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is determined according to the map in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> from the current gear level and the value of &Dgr;N3. Then, in the gradual connection cycle of time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is the next control cycle, a value produced by subtracting the step duty Ds<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the previous gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made the present gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and is outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, similarly, a revolution difference &Dgr;Nn is calculated in the gradual connection cycles of times tn (n&equals;4, 5, 6 . . . ), and a step duty Dsn is determined according to the map, and in the gradual connection cycle of a time tn&plus;1, which is the next control cycle, the step duty Dsn is subtracted from the previous gradual connection duty Dkn and is made the present gradual connection duty Dkn&plus;1, and is outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. By repeating such control, the clutch is connected a little at a time, and the revolution difference &Dgr;N grows steadily smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The step duty Ds calculation cycle and the control cycle &Dgr;t need not necessarily be equal. At such time, each time the step duty Ds is calculated, the gradual connection duty Dk is updated, and this update cycle constitutes the gradual connection cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Thus, if prescribed gradual connection end conditions exist, the gradual connection control ends, and a transition is made to clutch rapid connection control. The gradual connection end conditions of the present embodiment are that the revolution difference &Dgr;N is a small value and equal to or less than 150 rpm, or that the duty outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> reaches a gradual connection end duty De which is a value for when the clutch is adequately connected. In clutch rapid connection control, the rapid connection duty&equals;0 and this is outputted for a prescribed time interval equal to 0.3 sec. Then, thereafter, clutch complete connection control is performed to thereby end the clutch connection control. Similarly in clutch complete connection control, the complete connection duty&equals;0, and this is outputted for a prescribed time interval equal to 1 sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Next, a general shift-down example will be described using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Clutch control is largely the same at the time of a shift-down and a shift-up. A point of difference is that, at the time of a shift-down, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, since the input shaft revolution number Ni is higher that the engine revolution number Ne, calculation of the revolution difference &Dgr;N is also reversed in that the revolution difference &Dgr;N is calculated by subtracting the engine revolution number Ne from the input shaft revolution number Ni (&Dgr;N&equals;Ni&minus;Ne). Further, the value of the step duty Ds is a number calculated from a separate map which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Details of further clutch connection control are the same as provided above. In gradual connection control, the gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> constituting an initial value is outputted in the gradual connection cycle of time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the revolution difference &Dgr;N3 is calculated, and the step duty Ds<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is determined according to the map in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> from the present gear level and the value of &Dgr;N3. Then, in the gradual connection cycle of time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is the next control cycle, a value produced by subtracting the step duty Ds<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the previous gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made the present gradual connection duty Dk<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and is outputted from the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, by repeating such a process, the clutch is connected a little at a time. The subsequent clutch rapid connection control and clutch complete connection control are performed in the same way as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the above-described clutch gradual connection control, since the clutch is connected while continually monitoring the actual connection conditions, namely the clutch input/output revolution difference, there is an advantage that it is possible to suit the control to individual clutch differences such as variations in the torque point learning value, in the clutch characteristics, or in the oil temperature, and the like, and/or to deviations in the usage conditions, to thereby continually achieve compatibility between connection shock and connection time, such that variations in the feel caused by the above-mentioned variations can be resolved and it is possible to achieve a stable feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Next, clutch connection mode selection, which is a characteristic feature relating to the present invention, will be described in detail. This clutch connection mode selection is carried out at time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the four modes below are preset in the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as clutch connection modes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> (1) Garage shift mode (mode G); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> (2) Engine plus mode (mode E); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> (3) In-shaft plus mode (mode I); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> (4) Synchro mode (mode S). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Further, the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> selects any given mode on the basis of the vehicle speed V at time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, and the clutch input/output side revolution difference &Dgr;N (&equals;engine revolution number Ne&mdash;the input shaft revolution number Ni; &Dgr;N2 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>). The conditions for selection are as below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> (1) When the vehicle speed V is less than a very low speed V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (3 km/h in the present embodiment), the garage shift mode is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> (2) When the vehicle speed V is equal to or greater than the very low speed V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> 1) When the revolution difference &Dgr;N is equal to or greater than a positive prescribed value &plus;N (&plus;150 rpm in the present embodiment), engine plus mode is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> 2) When the revolution difference &Dgr;N is equal to or less than a negative prescribed value &minus;N (&minus;150 rpm in the present embodiment), in-shaft plus mode is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> 3) When the revolution difference &Dgr;N is smaller than a positive prescribed value &plus;N and greater than a negative prescribed value &minus;N, synchro mode is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In actuality, since it is difficult to deal with negative values using the ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the conditions in 1), 2), 3) of (2) are substituted as below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Namely, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> (a) the engine revolution number&gE;the input shaft revolution number&plus;150 rpm; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (b) the engine revolution number&lt;the input shaft revolution number&plus;150 rpm; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> (c) the input shaft revolution number&gE;the engine revolution number&plus;150 rpm; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> (d) the input shaft revolution number&lt;the engine revolution number&plus;150 rpm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> According to such conditions, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> when (a) is established, engine plus mode is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> When (c) is established, in-shaft plus mode is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> When (b) and (d) are established, synchro mode is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The garage shift mode (mode G) is a mode for performing a clutch connection suited to a so-called garage shift (with an AT vehicle, the practice of putting the vehicle into gear such that creep is generated, while the vehicle is stationary before starting off). In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, values for a start duty Dst(G), a gradual connection duty initial value Dk0(G), a step duty Ds(G), and an end duty De(G), which are suited to a garage shift, are preset. When the vehicle speed is less than a vehicle speed V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (3 km/h), this mode is selected, and, thereafter, clutch connection control is performed by using each duty of this mode. Consequently, it is possible to perform a suitable clutch connection at the time of a garage shift, such that compatibility between connection shock and connection time is feasible and a favorable feel is obtained. Here, the step duty Ds(G) is provided by means of a map format whose parameters are the gear level and the revolution difference &Dgr;N. Values at respective points on the map are values suited to a garage shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The engine plus mode (mode E) is principally a mode that performs a clutch connection suited to a shift-up. In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, values for a start duty Dst(E), a gradual connection duty initial value Dk0(E), a step duty Ds(E), and an end duty De(E), which are suited to a shift-up, are preset. As described above, the step duty Ds(E) is provided by means of a map format whose parameters are the gear level and the revolution difference &Dgr;N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, generally, at the time of a shift-up, the engine revolution number is higher than the input shaft revolution number, and the revolution difference &Dgr;N assumes a positive value. On the other hand, when the vehicle speed is equal to or greater than a vehicle speed V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (3 km/h) and the revolution difference &Dgr;N is equal to or greater than a positive prescribed value &plus;N (&plus;150 rpm); the engine plus mode is selected, and, thereafter, clutch connection control is performed by using each duty of this mode. Consequently, it is possible to perform a suitable clutch connection at the time of a clutch connection following a shift-up, such that compatibility between connection shock and connection time is feasible and a favorable feel is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The in-shaft plus mode (mode I) is principally a mode that performs a clutch connection suited to a shift-down. In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, values for a start duty Dst(I), a gradual connection duty initial value Dk0(I), a step duty Ds(I), and an end duty De(I), which are suited to a shift-down, are preset. As described above, the step duty Ds(I) is provided by means of a map format whose parameters are the gear level and the revolution difference &Dgr;N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, generally, at the time of a shift-down, the input shaft revolution number is higher than the engine revolution number, and the revolution difference &Dgr;N assumes a negative value, which is the opposite of a shift-up case. On the other hand, when the vehicle speed is equal to or greater than a vehicle speed V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (3 km/h) and the revolution difference &Dgr;N is equal to or less than a negative prescribed value &minus;N (&minus;150 rpm), the in-shaft plus mode is selected, and, thereafter, a clutch connection is performed by using each duty of this mode. Consequently, it is possible to perform a suitable clutch connection at the time of a clutch connection following a shift-down, such that compatibility between connection shock and connection time is feasible and a favorable feel is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The synchro mode (mode S) is a mode that performs a clutch connection suited to a case where the clutch input/output side revolution difference is small, or, stated differently, to a case where the clutch input-side and output-side revolution numbers approach one another. In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, values for a start duty Dst(S), a gradual connection duty initial value Dk0(S), a step duty Ds(S), and an end duty De(S), which are suited to such a case, are preset. As described above, the step duty Ds(S) is provided by means of a map format whose parameters are the gear level and the revolution difference &Dgr;N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the clutch input-side and output-side revolution numbers approach one another, the synchro mode is selected, and, thereafter, since a clutch connection is performed by using each duty of this mode, a clutch connection which is suited to such a case is performed, such that compatibility between connection shock and connection time is feasible and a favorable feel is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> According to the present embodiment, at the time of a clutch connection following completion of a gear shift while the vehicle is traveling, an optimum clutch connection mode is selected in accordance with the size of clutch input-side and output-side revolution numbers upon completion of a gear shift, irrespective of whether a shift-up or a shift-down is actually performed. Specifically, any one of an engine plus mode, an in-shaft plus mode, and a synchro mode is selected in accordance with the revolution difference &Dgr;N, and clutch connection is performed according to this selected mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As a result, it becomes possible to obtain a suitable clutch connection feel under any conditions. In other words, in an ordinary shift-up or shift-down, the engine plus mode or in-shaft plus mode is selected to thereby obtain a suitable clutch connection feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the driver performs a gear-shift operation which differs from the norm, for example, when a shift-down is performed such that, in third gear, while the vehicle is traveling, the vehicle is temporarily put into neutral, and then put into second gear after coasting a short while until the vehicle speed has dropped sufficiently, when the vehicle is put into second gear, the input shaft revolution number is then already lower than for an ordinary shift-down case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In such a case, if conditions for selecting the engine plus mode are arranged, this mode is selected, and a clutch connection is then executed which is dependent on whether a shift-up has been performed, as it were. Further, if conditions for selecting the synchro mode are arranged, this mode is selected, and a clutch connection is then executed which is suited to such a case. Therefore, irrespective of whether the gear-shift operation actually performed is a shift-up or a shift-down, since a clutch connection conforming to the actual conditions is carried out, a suitable connection feel can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of the present invention is not limited to or by the embodiment described above. In the embodiment described above, three modes constituting clutch connection modes at the time of a gear shift while the vehicle is traveling, namely the engine plus mode, the in-shaft plus mode, and the synchro mode, are selected. However, the number of modes and the mode types can be suitably modified. Furthermore, the applicability of the present invention extends beyond a power transmission device of the kind described above. There are no particular requirements with regard to the form of the clutch or the transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention as described hereinabove, as far as clutch connection control at the time of a gear shift is concerned, superior effects are exhibited, namely that a suitable clutch connection feel is obtained, under any conditions. </paragraph>
