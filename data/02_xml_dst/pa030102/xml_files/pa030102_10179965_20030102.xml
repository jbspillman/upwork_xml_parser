<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a warehouse management system and corresponding method and, in particular, to a computerized automatic management system and a method for logistics control </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In conventional logistics systems, stock performs the roles of &ldquo;storage&rdquo; and &ldquo;conservation&rdquo;. However, under the pressures of new consumer demands, huge amounts of complicated data, and competitive markets, goods must enter and leave a stock system in a rapid and complicated manner so as to achieve proper timing and satisfy the market&apos;s requirements of quantity and variety. Therefore, a dynamic management function for warehouse systems has become more important than the simple conservation function in conventional warehousing. The dynamic management function combines the conventional stock system and the currently popular data stock system. The purpose of such a combination is to plan and manage storage space so as to effectively control the sources, destinations and fluctuations of commodities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Nowadays, many stock management systems do not have a sufficient number of functions. Without a client operating interface, the following situations occur: (a) the client rents space from a host stock and directly operates using the client&apos;s stock management system; (b) the client does not use its own stock management system and the host enters data for the client; and (c) stock operation information is entered repetitively (in both the client and the host systems). This is all because the logistics information cannot be transmitted or shared, causing a vicious circle of production distribution quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, computerization of business administration is a necessary means to increase the competitive power of an enterprise. A logistics company can make more advanced management of the arrivals and deliveries of materials through computerization, increasing the management level and processing efficiency of daily business. The collection of statistics and information can thus be more real-time and accurate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Consequently, a computerized automatic management system and corresponding method for logistic control are important subjects of study in the field. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention adopts a client/server design model. An objective of the invention is to provide a web page on an Intranet as the human-machine interface to implement the automatic management of the logistic, increasing the operation efficiency of production-distribution businesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The disclosed computerized automatic management system for logistics control includes at least a good arrival processing module, a good picking module, and a good delivery module. The good arrival module generates a good arrival checklist and a good acceptance list according to a good arrival/return note in order to process the arrival of good. The good picking module schedules delivery trucks and optimizes storage locations according to a goods delivery note from a client and then processes goods picking. After the goods are selected, the good delivery module loads goods according to a delivery list and confirms the loading result. After the goods are shipped out, the good delivery module confirms the shipping result and completes delivery of the good. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention also discloses a computerized automatic management method for logistics control. The method includes the steps of: entering a good arrival/return note, printing a good arrival checklist according to the good arrival/return note; entering actual accepted items and quantities to complete the good arrival; outputting a good delivery note, scheduling delivery trucks, optimizing storage locations and preparing data according to the good delivery route; printing a good picking list, a good delivery list, and a route list; picking goods and confirming the good picking; loading the goods according to the good delivery list and confirming the loading result; shipping the goods and confirming the shipping result; confirming the delivery result and closing the case to complete the good delivery.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the main functional module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a good arrival processing module <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a good picking-processing module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and a good delivery-processing module <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The good arrival processing module <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> performs good arrival and stocking according to the following situations: (a) a client provides a good arrival note to request good arrival; (b) a client provides a good return note to request good return; (c) some goods are returned after delivery due to some mistake made by the company or the client and they need to be stocked again. A good arrival/return note is used in the above situations to generate a good arrival checklist and a good acceptance list to process good arrival. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The main function of the good picking module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, after scheduling trucks and optimizing storage locations, is to print a good picking list, a good delivery list and a route list according to the good delivery note provided by the client. It tells a stock manager the storage locations and quantities of requested goods. The goods are selected and put on a platform for confirming the good picking result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> After good picking, the good delivery processing module <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> loads the goods according to the good delivery list printed after scheduling delivery trucks and confirms the loading result. After the goods are shipped out, it confirms the shipping result. If there is any mistake in the shipping, the module <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> fills an error form to process the re-arrival of the goods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The detailed operations of the good arrival processing module <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the good picking processing module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the good delivery processing module <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> are described individually as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> (1) The Good Arrival Processing Module <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, step <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> enters data of goods that will arrive. Step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> determines whether data are entered correctly. If no good is arriving, the procedure ends. If there are goods arriving, they are checked and distributed into predetermined storage locations for arrived goods if accepted. A good arrival checklist is also printed (step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>). Step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> checks the goods and puts them into the stock. The actual items and quantities being accepted and the storage locations are then put down in the good arrival checklist and the case is closed and confirmed (step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>). After the good arrival is completed, the accepted goods will be selected and delivered in the subsequent procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> (2) The Good Picking Processing Module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> enters a good delivery list according to a client&apos;s good delivery requests. Step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> determines whether they are correct good delivery data. If there is no good delivery list, the procedure ends. Otherwise, data are processed according to delivery routes (step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>). Step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> prints a good picking list, a good delivery list, and a route list. The good-picking list gives a good storage location and quantity for each good. Therefore, the goods can be readily selected according to the good picking list. Step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> enters the actual storage locations and quantities of the selected goods to a good delivery main file and a good delivery detail file in the database, confirm the selection and closes the case. The selected goods will be loaded and delivered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> (3) The Good Delivery Processing Module <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, goods are loaded into trucks according to the printed good delivery list. The actual quantities are confirmed and the case is closed (step <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>). The goods are then shipped according to the delivery routes printed on the route list. Finally, the delivery result and the truck shipping record are stored and confirmed (step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>). Step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> determines whether there are any mistakes in the good delivery. If there are no mistakes, the procedure ends. If some goods are returned for some reason, they have to be processed for re-arrival (step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates how the techniques disclosed are implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The commodity arrival module: When a client (some company) has a good arrival request, the good arrival note provided by the client is entered in step <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. In the checking procedure, all arrived goods are checked according to the printed good arrival checklist and filed into predetermined good storage locations in step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> enters the actual accepted items and quantities and closes the case. Step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> ends the good arrival procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The good picking module: Suppose a client (some company) has a good delivery request for sending goods to the headquarters of some supermarket. Step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> enters the client&apos;s good delivery note. Step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> schedules trucks, optimizes storage locations, and processes data according to good delivery routes. That is, data are processed according to the good delivery destinations. Step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> prints a good delivery list, a good picking list and a route list (giving truck delivery routes). Step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> selects goods according to the good picking list and confirms the selection result. Step <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> ends the good picking procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The good delivery module: Goods are loaded into trucks according to the good delivery list in step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The trucks deliver the goods according to the route list and the shipping is confirmed in step <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> confirms the good delivery result and closes the case. Step <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> finishes the good delivery procedure. </paragraph>
