<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to clinching mechanisms for stapler devices which include movable clinching wings that operate to fold the legs of a staple against a work piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Automatic stapler devices are commonly used in modern photocopiers and the like, and it is an important feature of the design of such automatic stapler devices that, after clinching of the legs of a staple, the staple project a minimum distance above and below the upper and lower surfaces respectively of a work piece so as to minimise the impact which the presence of the staple has on the overall thickness of the work piece. This has been achieved by the use of clinching wings which are actuated once a staple has been driven through a work piece to engage, bend and clinch the legs of the staple such that they lie substantially flat against the underside of the work piece. However, stapler devices of this kind are typically loaded with staples of a size to suit a wide range of thicknesses of work piece, and as a result, if a thin work piece is stapled, the clinched legs will be much longer than for a thick work piece, and if the clinched legs are too long, they will overlap, which is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> PCT/US90/00492 teaches a clinching mechanism which overcomes this problem by using an anvil plate which includes a pair of parallel vertical slots that are arranged in side by side overlapping configuration for receiving the unclinched legs of a staple as they protrude from the underside of the work piece and guiding each leg into engagement with its associate clinching wing. The clinching wings are similarly offset from each other in the vertical plane so as to lie in side-by-side planes so that upon rotation of the clinching wings towards the work piece, each leg of the staple is bent into its associated slot and the two legs are brought to lie flat against the work piece parallel to each other, thereby allowing the legs to pass one another as necessary. The arrangement has the drawback, however, that there is a high likelihood that the legs might move laterally of the clinching wings during clinching, resulting in their overlapping and possibly even jamming the staple in the anvil plate, thereby preventing removal of the work piece from the stapling device. This problem is further exasperated due to the fact the overlap between the slots in the anvil plate must be large in order to accommodate for the wide variety of work piece thicknesses and resulting leg lengths, which could lead to a leg being received in the wrong slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,593,847 discloses a clinching mechanism which overcomes this problem by forming the slots in the anvil in parallel spaced apart arrangement and positioning a vertically extending plate between and parallel to the slots, which plate prevents the leg that engages in one slot from being clinched across the other slot. However, this system has the disadvantage that the clinched legs will be spaced apart from each other by at least the thickness of the plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a clinching mechanism which prevents the legs of the staple from overlapping each other during the clinching operation without imposing a minimum separation between the clinched legs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a clinching assembly for guiding and clinching a staple, comprising first, second and third plates arranged in a spaced apart stack with said second plate positioned between said first plate and said third plate, first clinching means located between said first plate and said second plate and operable, in use, to clinch a first staple leg received in a first slot formed by the space between said first plate and said second plate, and second clinching means located between said second plate and said third plate and operable, in use, to clinch a second staple leg received in a second slot formed in the space between said second plate and said third plate, wherein said first and third plates have at least one aligned edge forming an anvil surface of the clinching assembly, and said second plate is movable relative to said first and third plates between a first aligned position in which it has an edge aligned with said anvil surface so as to prevent interference between the staple legs as they engage in their respective slots, and a second retracted position in which said edge is withdrawn from said anvil surface so as, in use, to be at least partially retracted from between said inserted staple legs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a method of clinching a staple comprising the steps of inserting the staple legs through a work piece into a clinching assembly on opposite sides of a guide plate, at least partially retracting the guide plate from between the unclenched staple legs and then clinching the staple legs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the invention provides a method in which the face of an anvil composed of three spaced apart and stacked plates is driven against one side of a workpiece, a staple is pressed through from the other side of the work piece so that the legs engage in apertures on opposite sides of the middle of said stack plates which forms said guide plate, said guide plate is retracted relative to the side plates, clinching means are actuated to clinch the staple legs against the work piece, the anvil is withdrawn from the workpiece and the guide plate is returned to its original position relative to said side plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A clinching assembly and method of use thereof in accordance with the invention has the advantage that the legs of the staples are kept separated when they are inserted into the assembly by the second plate, thereby preventing interference therebetween and in particular preventing the possibility of their crossing over, whilst allowing the legs to be clinched into close alignment with each other and the crown of the staple, thereby resulting in a staple which is much more compact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the clinching means have clinching surfaces which cooperating with the staple legs to develop a camming action therewith that urges the legs laterally towards each other and the staple crown during clinching. In the preferred embodiment, this is achieved by making the clinching surfaces inclined towards each other, but they may also have curved surfaces or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The distance through which the second plate should be moveable relative to the first and third plates, that is the distance between the aligned and the retracted positions of the second plate, is dependant upon the distance which the unclinched staple legs protrude through the work piece to be stapled. The second plate is retracted in order to allow the clinched staple legs to be pressed in close alignment with each other in the final stages of the clinching operation whilst still to be kept separate during the initial bending so as to prevent their overlapping. Accordingly, if the staple legs are particularly long, the second plate may be designed to be retracted further than if the legs are short, it being important merely that the clinched legs are closely aligned with the staple crown but not overlapping in the direction perpendicular to the staple crown. It has been found that a movement of the second plate of less than or equal to 3 mm provides acceptable results for a good range of staple sizes and work pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The clinching means are preferably disposed in mirror image configuration on either side of the second plate and include clinching wings that are pivotally mounted to the first and third plates respectively and which have a curved surface against which an actuating lever associated with each clinching wing engages, each actuating lever pressing against said surface of its associated clinching wing to move it to its clinched position. The actuating levers are advantageously themselves pivotally mounted on their associated plates and are biased by torsion springs into operating engagement with their clinching wings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Locking means may then be provided, preferably in the form of protrusions on the second plate, which restrain the actuating levers against the force of the biasing means so as to lock the clinching wings in their unclinched position. It is particularly advantageous for the locking means to be so realised as protrusions on the second plate which release the actuating levers to operate the clinching wings when the second plate is retracted, since automatic operation of the clinching wings is thereby achieved in a particularly simple and effective manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the clinching wings each have a lever arm that protrudes laterally from the plates and is engageable to rotate its clinching wings from its clinched to its unclinched position against the force of the biasing spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The plates are preferably generally rectangular and are biased into alignment with each other, preferably by means of a spring that engages simultaneously into apertures formed in the three plates that are aligned when the edges of the plates which form the anvil surface are aligned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The plates are preferably slidably mounted in a housing by means of bushes that are slidable along bars fixed in the housing and which have studs that engage in openings in the plates. The second plate can then be made to be movable to a limited degree relative to the first and third plates in a particularly simple manner by constraining the first and third plates to move with the bushes by making their openings a tolerance fit on the studs and elongating the opening in the second plate to allow it to move to a limited degree relative to the bushes and hence the first and third plates. This arrangement provides a particularly simple anchoring system for the plates whilst still allowing the necessary inter-movements between the plates for proper operation of the invention </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown an exploded perspective view of a clinching mechanism for clinching the legs of staples and other similar fixing devices. The mechanism comprises three generally rectangular plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, stacked together in face to face relationship, the lower ends <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the three plates together forming an anvil face against which, in use, a stack of paper to be stapled is pressed during a clinching operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Pivotally mounted between the first plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which acts as a guide plate during clinching in the manner described hereinafter, is a clinching wing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and an associated actuating lever <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> such that said plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are maintained in a spaced apart relationship, thereby creating a channel within which a leg of a staple can be received for clinching.

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The clinching wing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> also has a second lever arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which extends along an axis that is inclined to the longitudinal axis of the clinching face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>such that when the clinching face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is in its first position, it extends from a side flank of the plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> substantially parallel to the anvil face formed by the lower ends <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and when the clinching face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is in its second position, its extends from said side flank at an inclined angle to said anvil face as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> An actuating lever biasing spring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the form of a torsion spring is mounted on the outer face <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the first plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and engages the actuating lever <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with a spring leg <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to bias the actuating lever <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> against the camming surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the clinching wing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and hence bias the clinching wing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> into its second position. The actuating lever <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> also has a second lever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the end of which is formed a hook <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is engageable with a projecting lip <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> formed on the neighbouring face of the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order to lock the actuating lever against rotation under the biasing load of the torsional spring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and hence to lock the clinching wing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in its first position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A second clinching wing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and associated actuating arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are pivotally mounted between the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and third plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a mirror image configuration to those mounted between the first plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that the first and second clinching wings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> overlap when in their second, clinched positions. A second biasing spring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then mounted on the outer face of the third plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which engages the second actuating arm so as to bias it into engagement with the second clinching wing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and a second projecting lip <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed on the face of the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> neighbouring the second actuating lever <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which co-operates with a hook formed on the end of the latter in order to restrain the second actuating lever <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> against rotation under the loading of the biasing spring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Apart from the mirror image configuration, the second clinching wing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, actuating lever <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and biasing spring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are identical with those disposed between the first and guide plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and will not, therefore be described here in any further detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The three plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, each have four apertures formed in them by means of which they are fixed together and mounted on four mounting bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, screws <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> securely fixing the plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Each mounting bush <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has a projecting stud <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> composed of three distinct portions having difference cross-sectional shapes, a root portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, an intermediate portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and an end portion <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The root portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> has a substantially square cross-section that engages in the apertures <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the third plate which are of complementary size and shape to the root portion so that the third plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is constrained to move with the bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The end portions <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> have a circular cross-section and are engage by the apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed in the first plate, which, as with the third plate, are of complementary size and shape to the end portions of the studs such that the first plate is constrained to move with the bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>.

In this way, when mounted on the bushes, the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is slidably movable relative to the bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and hence relative to the first <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and third <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> plates, through a limited distance of preferably no greater than 3 mm between a first position in which the top and bottom edges of the three plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are aligned and a second position in which the upper edge of the guide plate is raised above the corresponding edges of the first and third plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the bottom edge <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is withdrawn between the first and third plates. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Formed in the front of the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a slot <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in which is slidably mounted a lifting bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which cooperates with the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order to move it relative to said first and third plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> against the loading of the spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the manner described below. A hole <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is also formed in the front of the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> adjacent the slot <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in which is mounted a compression spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that engages between the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the lifting bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in order to bias the latter out of the slot <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> towards the plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The third plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a generally &lsquo;T&rsquo; shaped aperture <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> formed therein, the bottom of which is enlarged to allow a forwardly projecting panel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the lifting bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to protrude through the aperture <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the third plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and engage in a generally rectangular lifting aperture <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> formed in the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The apertures <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are respectively positioned in the third and guide plates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that when the three plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are aligned with each other the lower sides of the apertures <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are also aligned. The enlarged bottom portion of the &lsquo;T&rsquo; shaped aperture <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is, however, slightly longer than the lifting aperture <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> formed in the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that as lifting bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is moved upwards away from the anvil face by the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, it engages the upper edge of the lifting aperture <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> before it reaches the constriction in the &lsquo;T&rsquo; shaped aperture. Upon further upward movement of the lifting bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then carried upwards with the lifting bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> from its first aligned position towards its second position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As illustrated more clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the enlarged bottom part of the &lsquo;T&rsquo; shaped aperture includes, at its upper end, ramp portions <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> which are inclined downwardly and towards the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As the upwards movement of the lifting bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> continues, these ramp portions engage flank portions formed on the bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the resulting camming action causes the bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to be pressed towards the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> against the force of the biasing spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> whereupon the lifting bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is disengaged from the lifting aperture <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> thereby de-coupling the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the lifting bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is able to continue to move upwards with the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> along the &lsquo;T&rsquo; shaped aperture independently of the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the third plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Also slidably mounted on the guide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> between the upper bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a locking plate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which has a projecting portion that engages in an upper part of the &lsquo;T&rsquo; shaped aperture <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> so as to constrain the third plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for movement with the locking plate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A locking spring <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, which takes the form of a compression spring, is mounted on one of the guide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> between one of the upper bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of one side of the locking plate, the loading of which spring <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> urges the locking plate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> into an inclined position on the slide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The tolerance between the locking plate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and one of the slide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is closer then with the other slide bar, so that in the inclined position, the locking plate frictionally engages the surface of said one guide bar <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, restraining it, and hence the first <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and third <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> plates from longitudinal movement. Whilst it is preferred that the locking plate only grips one of the slide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when tilted, it is also possible that the locking plate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> could instead be made to grip both slide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the mechanism in its reset position ready for the next clinching operation in which the three plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are all aligned with the hooks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the actuating arms <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> engaging against the projecting lips <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby retaining the clinching wings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in their first, unclenched positions. The plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are furthermore in their upper most positions by virtue of the upper pair of bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> being retained in position at the upper limit of their travel along the guide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which has been driven to the top of the housing by the worm gear <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> into abutment with the locking plate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Upon initiation of a clinching operation, the motor <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is operated to rotate the worm gear <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which, in turn, drives the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> downwards along the guide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> towards the lower pair of bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> travels past the enlarged bottom portion of the &lsquo;T&rsquo; shaped opening, the lifting bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is pressed away from the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by the spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that its forwardly projecting panel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> protrudes into the apertures <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the third and guide plates. The slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> continues to be driven downwards by the motor <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> whilst the plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> remain stationary until the bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> reaches and engages the lower pair of the bushes. The slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> then pushes the lower bushes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> downwards on the guide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which, in turn, drive the plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which are constrained to move with the bushes (the second plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is at this stage positioned with the studs at the lower end of the apertures <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). The assembly is hence translated into the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 7</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in which, in use, the anvil plate formed by the lower edges of the three plates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pressed against a stack of papers which are to be stapled. Since, at this stage, the anvil assembly composed of the three plates, the clinching wings and accompanying parts have moved as a single assembly, the hooks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the actuating arms <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> remain in engagement with the projection lips <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the clinching wings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> remain in their first positions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Once the anvil plate is pressed against the stack of papers <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a staple <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is pressed through the papers by a stapling head in a manner which is well known in the art and which will not, therefore, be explained here in detail. As the two staple legs <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> pass through the paper, they engage in the spaces formed on either side of the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and are guided towards the clinching surfaces of the first and second clinching wings respectively. The clinching wings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are still in their first, unclinched positions at this stage, but, depending on the lengths of the staple legs <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the thickness of the stack of papers <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the tip of each staple leg <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> may still engage the clinching surface of its associated clinching wing and be bent towards its clinched position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Once the staple is fully inserted through the stack of papers, the direction of the motor <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is reversed so that the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is driven upwards in the housing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> along the guide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> carrying the bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with it. As the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> travels upwards, the projecting panel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the bracket slides along the apertures <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the guide and third panels until it reaches the upper edge of the lifting aperture <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. At this stage, continued upward movement of the slide bar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> cause the bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to lift the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with it, moving it from its first position to its second position, which is preferably a distance of less than or equal to 3 mm, against the loading of the biasing spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The first <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and third <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> plates remain stationary, however, due to the locking plate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, to which, as described above, the third plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is locked, being restrained against movement along the guide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by the friction arising from the inclined position it takes up on the guide bars <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as a result of the loading of the spring <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As the guide plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is lifted relative to the first and third plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as well as relative to the clinching wings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and associated parts which are, as described above, mounted respectively on the first and third plates, the projecting lips <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> move out of engagement with the hooks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the actuating levers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This releases each lever <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to pivot against the camming surface of its associated clinching wing under the loading of the springs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which clinching wings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are, in turn, caused to rotate about their pivot points towards their second, clinched positions, whereupon the legs <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the staple are clinched as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 20</cross-reference>. The hooks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are preferably 3 mm high or less so that, as described above the second plate need only move through a maximum of 3 mm to release the actuating levers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
