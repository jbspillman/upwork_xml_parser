<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a manufacturing technique for a wiring substrate on which a semiconductor chip is mounted. Particularly, this invention relates to &ldquo;semiconductor-chip-mounting&rdquo; wiring substrate having position information and a semiconductor device using the same wherein failure analysis can be effectively conducted when a defect occurs in the wiring substrate or the semiconductor device using the same. This invention also relates to a process for manufacturing such a semiconductor-chip-mounting wiring substrate and a semiconductor device using the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, there has been a demand for reducing the weight and thickness of a wiring substrate so that a BGA (Ball Grid Array) semiconductor chip, the size of which is reduced and the number of pins of which is increased, can be mounted on the wiring substrate. Therefore, a plastic type wiring substrate, in which glass-epoxy resin composite boards are laminated, is widely used for the wiring substrate. This plastic type wiring board is typically manufactured as follows. A resin board (glass-epoxy resin composite board), on one face or both faces of which copper foil is stuck, is subjected to resist coating and etching so that a copper wiring pattern is formed on the board. Alternatively, through-holes are formed on a resin board and copper plating is conducted on the inner wall faces of the through-holes. Such resin boards are laminated with epoxy adhesive to obtain a plastic type wiring board. A predetermined number of semiconductor chips are mounted on the thus made wiring substrate. In this way, a semiconductor device is manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, the manufacturing process of this semiconductor device includes: a process of die attaching for mounting semiconductor chips on the substrate; a process of wire bonding for electrically connecting electrodes of each semiconductor chip with a wiring pattern on the substrate; a process of molding for sealing the semiconductor chips and wires with sealing resin; a process of ball mounting for connecting external connecting terminals such as solder balls with a substrate face on a side opposite to the side on which the semiconductor chips are mounted; and a cutting process for cutting the substrate into packages (semiconductor device). Concerning the method of molding, there are provided an individual molding in which molding is conducted for each semiconductor chip and a batch type molding in which molding is conducted for a plurality of semiconductor chips all at once. Recently, there is a tendency toward the batch type molding from the viewpoint of enhancing the efficiency of assembling a package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> If the semiconductor device manufactured by this manufacturing process is evaluated, its performance, price and reliability are important factors. Because the semiconductor device has been highly integrated and further the manufacturing device has been highly developed recently, the performance of the semiconductor device is greatly enhanced and the price is greatly reduced. Since the performance and price are stabilized as described above, in order to enhance the reliability, it is very important to quickly conduct failure analysis at a high technical level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the prior art, for example, failure analysis is conducted as follows. After the electrical characteristic evaluation is completed for each semiconductor device which has already been subjected to the diffusion process at the wafer level, each semiconductor device is sorted so as to determine whether it is a non-defective product or it is a defective product. When a defective product is found, it is subjected to the failure analysis, so that the cause of the failure can be found. On the other hand, a non-defective product is subjected to mounting, and a delivery inspection is made to find whether it is a non-defective product or it is a defective product. When the semiconductor device is a non-defective product, it is delivered to the market. When the semiconductor device is a defective product, failure analysis is conducted in the same manner as that described before, so that the cause of the failure can be found. Further, when the non-defective product (semiconductor device), which has already been delivered to the market, becomes defective, the defective semiconductor device is recalled and subjected to failure analysis in the same manner so as to find the cause of the failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the following problems may be encountered in the aforementioned conventional method of failure analysis for analyzing a failure of a semiconductor device. In the case where a problem is found in a semiconductor device by a delivery inspection conducted after the product has been assembled (after it has been divided into each package), it is impossible to clearly specify a position of the semiconductor device at which the package (semiconductor device) was located on a sheet which is a state of the wiring substrate before it was divided into each package. Specifically, it is impossible to clearly judge whether the problems were caused at the specific position on the wiring substrate or the problems were caused in a specific process in the manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to make sure where each package was located when it was in a sheet state, it was necessary to make a reproducing experiment in such a manner that marking such as scratching, was manually conducted in the sheet state so that each package position can be specified after the completion of assembling a product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, this work is very complicated and takes a long time. Therefore, from the viewpoint of enhancing the efficiency of a failure analysis, it is not necessarily preferable to conduct marking and make such a reproducing experiment. Further, even if the above reproducing experiment is made, it is sometimes difficult to make sure of the position of each package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the prior art, in the case where some problems occur in the delivery inspection, it is not always possible to clearly specify the position of each package (semiconductor device) when it was in a sheet state. Therefore, it was impossible to quickly feed back the result of the failure analysis to the manufacturing process. Accordingly, it was impossible to enhance the efficiency of the failure analysis. The above problems may also occur in the case where a semiconductor device, which was once delivered to the market, becomes defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above problems, it is possible to take a countermeasure in which a piece of characteristic information is given to each semiconductor chip in the manufacturing process. An example of this countermeasure is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. (JP-A) 5-129384. According to the above patent publication, numerals or marks representing a piece of chip attribute information, which represents a position on a wafer at which the chip was located in the manufacturing process, are written in the periphery of a semiconductor element mounting region on the wafer, which is a region finally cut off as an individual semiconductor chip, except for a region in which the semiconductor circuit is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, according to the above technique described in JP-A 5-129384, since the chip attribute information is composed of numerals or marks which are combined with each other, it is necessary to provide a region on the wafer in which the chip attribute information is written. Since the space on the wafer is limited, it is difficult to write the chip attribute information on the wafer. Further, this technique disclosed in JP-A 5-129384 is provided for discriminating not a package substrate but a wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Separately from the technique disclosed in the above patent publication, it is possible to consider a technique in which the same chip attribute information is written on the connecting ball joining face of the wafer which is opposite to the side on which the chip is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, according to this method, there will be a case in which it is impossible to write the chip attribute information because the space is limited depending upon an arrangement and an arrangement pitch of external terminals (solder balls) to be joined since a demand for reducing the size and increasing the number of pins is strong. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an arrangement plan view showing a model of a wiring substrate having positional information of the first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the view is taken from a chip mounting side of the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having position information of the present embodiment. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shows a region, which will be referred to as &ldquo;a semiconductor element mounting region&rdquo; hereinafter, on which a semiconductor chip is mounted, which is cut off finally so that each semiconductor device (package) can be made. The semiconductor element mounting regions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are arranged into a matrix form of 3&times;3. Further, four groups of this matrix form are arranged, continuously in the longitudinal direction. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a slit for separating the groups of this matrix form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a solder resist layer which is used as a protective film (insulating layer) to cover a surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a mold gate which is used as a pouring port from which sealing resin is poured when the package is subjected to molding. This mold gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed in such a manner that a predetermined portion of the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is removed as described later, that is, a predetermined portion in the cross section of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is opened. This mold gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is defined by a region in which the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not formed on the chip mounting side of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in the drawing, the mold gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided in a portion corresponding to each group of the matrix form regions (3&times;3). In the case of assembling a package, molding is conducted on the corresponding nine semiconductor chips from the mold gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> all at once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Reference mark MP represents a plating leader line used as &ldquo;positional information&rdquo; which is an important element in the present invention. As shown in the drawing, the plating leader line, the profile of which is peculiar to itself, is arranged in the periphery of each semiconductor element mounting region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Plating leader line MP is used as a wire for electrolytic plating described later, which is formed simultaneously when predetermined wiring patterns are formed on both sides of the substrate. In this connection, in order to simplify the drawing, the wiring patterns are omitted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Reference mark SL represents a feeder, which electrically connects plating leader lines MP of the groups of the matrix form (3&times;3) with each other. Due to the above structure, it is possible to conduct electrolytic plating of Au on the bonding pads of the wiring pattern as described later. Feeder SL is formed simultaneously with plating leader line MP. Feeder SL is formed at a position in a substrate cutting portion where cutting is finally conducted when a package is assembled. Accordingly, when each semiconductor device is cut off, feeder SL is removed. Therefore, plating leader line MP of the semiconductor device concerned is electrically independent from the plating leader lines of other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Next, explanations will be made into a method of manufacturing the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having positional information of the present embodiment. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) which are sectional views taken on line A-A&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in which the manufacturing processes are successively shown, the method will be explained below. In order to simplify the drawing, the double layer wiring structure is shown in the drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> First of all, in the first process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), there is prepared a core base plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, on both faces of which pieces of copper (Cu) foil <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are attached. For example, glass cloth, which is used as base material, is impregnated with organic resin such as BT resin, epoxy resin or polyimide resin, so that the core base plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is composed. On both faces of the core base plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, pieces of copper (Cu) foil <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are laminated and bonded. In this way, &ldquo;the glass cloth base material copper covered laminated plate&rdquo; is prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Instead of the base plate on which glass cloth is used as base material, a tape (TAB) base plate made of polyimide resin may be used as base material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), at predetermined positions on the copper covered laminated plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), through-holes <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are formed, for example, by means of a mechanical drill. In this case, depending upon the diameter of the through-hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to be formed, instead of using the mechanical drill, it is possible to use CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser beams or excimer laser beams to form the predetermined holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the conductive layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of Cu is formed on the entire face of the copper covered lamination layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) including the inner walls of the through-holes <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. This conductive layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed in such a manner that, for example, after a thin-film-shaped Cu layer has been formed on the entire face by means of electroless plating of Cu, this thin-film-shaped Cu layer is used as a feeder layer, and a Cu layer is further laminated on the thin-film-shaped Cu layer by means of electrolytic plating of Cu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the photosensitive dry films <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which are used as etching resist, are thermally stuck with pressure onto both faces of the copper covered laminated plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) on which the conductive layers (Cu layer) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the dry films <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> provided on both sides are exposed to light by using the masks <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which have been previously patterned according to a predetermined wiring pattern and a predetermined profile of plating leader line MP including feeder SL. That is, each mask <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is positioned on each dry film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and ultraviolet rays (UV) are irradiated to each mask <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from an upper and a lower portion of the mark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the dry films <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on both sides are subjected to development, so that patterning is conducted on each dry film. This development is conducted as follows. In the case where the dry film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is a negative type resist, development is conducted with a developing solution containing an organic solvent. In the case where the dry film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is a positive type resist, development is conducted with an alkali developing solution. In the example shown in the drawing, the negative type resist is used. Therefore, a portion (exposed portion) of each dry film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which has been irradiated with UV, is left. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), for example, wet etching is conducted while each patterned dry film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is being used as a mask (In this case, a solution in which Cu is soluble is used for wet etching.), so that the Cu layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (Although not shown in the drawing, the lower Cu foil <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is included.) in the exposed portion is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the dry film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is peeled and removed. Due to the foregoing, the predetermined wiring pattern WP, which is composed of a portion of the conductor layer (Cu layer) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and plating leader line MP (including feeder SL) are formed on both sides of the core substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), on both sides of the core substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on which the conductive layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (wiring pattern WP, plating leader line MP and feeder SL) is formed, a photosensitive resist is coated, for example, by means of screen printing (Formation of the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the solder resist layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on both faces are exposed to light while the masks <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which are respectively patterned by a predetermined profile, are being used. That is, each mask <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is positioned on each solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and ultraviolet rays (UV) are irradiated from an upper and a lower portion of each mask <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> as shown by arrows in the drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Each mask <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> used in this process is subjected to patterning according to the profile of a predetermined electrode pad together with the profiles of the above wiring pattern WP, plating leader line MP and feeder SL. Further, concerning the mask <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on the chip mounting side, patterning is conducted according to the profile of the mold gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), each solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is developed, and patterning is conducted according to the above predetermined profile. This is conducted in the same manner as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), that is, developing is conducted with a developing solution containing an organic solvent (in the case of a negative resist type), or developing is conducted with a developing solution containing an alkali solvent (in the case of a positive resist type). In the example shown in the drawing, a case of the negative resist type is shown. Therefore, a portion of each solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which has been exposed to UV, is left. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In this case, portions, in which the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has been removed and the conductive layer (Cu layer) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has been exposed, compose the above wiring pattern WP, plating leader line MP and feeder SL and also compose a pad with which a bonding wire connected with an electrode of the semiconductor chip is connected and a pad connected with a solder ball (external connecting terminal). A portion from which the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has been removed on the chip mounting side composes the mold gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the final process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the conductive layers (Cu layer) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively exposed from solder resist layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on both sides are subjected to electrolytic plating of nickel (Ni) while each conductive layer (Cu layer) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is being used as a feeder layer. Further, electrolytic plating of Au is conducted, so that the conductive layers (Ni/Au layer) <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are respectively formed. These Ni/Au layers are formed so that the adhesion property can be enhanced when bonding wires are connected at the latter stage and also the adhesion property can be enhanced when solder balls are connected at the latter stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to the above processes shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having positional information of the present embodiment is manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Next, the semiconductor device into which the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having positional information of the present embodiment is incorporated will be explained below referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) in which the manufacturing processes are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> First of all, in the first process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), die attaching and wire bonding are conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> That is, the adhesive <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> made of epoxy resin is coated in the chip (or die) mounting region on the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Then, while a reverse side of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be mounted is set downward, that is, while a face opposite to the side on which the electrode is formed is set downward, the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is made to adhere to the chip mounting region with the adhesive <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (die attaching). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Next, the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the Cu layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are electrically connected with each other by the bonding wire <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> made of Au through the pad exposed from the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, that is, through the Ni/Au layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (wire bonding). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In this connection, in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), only one semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is mounted so as to simplify the explanation, however, a plurality of semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are mounted in the actual structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the next process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the bonding wire <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are sealed with the sealing resin <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by the batch type molding system. This sealing work is conducted in such a manner that while a molding metallic die (not shown) having a recess corresponding to the final profile of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is used and the sealing resin is being poured into the recess from the mold gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, heat and pressure are given. In this process, the batch type molding system is used, however, of course, the individual molding system may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the final process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), ball mounting and cutting are conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> That is, the solder balls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are put on the Cu layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via the pads exposed from the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the side opposite to the chip mounting side, that is, via the Ni/Au layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and reflowing is conducted so that the solder balls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are joined to the pads concerned (ball mounting). Due to the foregoing, the solder balls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be electrically connected with the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from the pads concerned via the Cu layers formed on the inner walls of the through-holes <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, wiring patterns WP on the chip mounting side and bonding wires <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Next, the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having positional information is divided by a dicer into each package together with the sealing resin <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on broken line D-D&prime;, so that the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is obtained (cutting). As described before, feeder SL (a portion of the Cu layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) is removed at this time, and plating leader line MP (a portion of the Cu layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is electrically separated from the plating leader lines of other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) are plan views showing an arrangement of an example of a semiconductor device manufactured in the processes shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), that is, an example of a semiconductor device into which the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having positional information shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is incorporated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a plan view of the semiconductor device before resin sealing is conducted, wherein the semiconductor device is viewed from a face on which the chip is mounted, and corresponds to an arrangement which is viewed from an upper portion of the substrate in the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a plan view of the semiconductor device after resin sealing is conducted, wherein the semiconductor device is viewed from a face on which the chip is mounted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is a plan view of the semiconductor device, wherein the semiconductor device is viewed from a face on which the balls are mounted. These drawings respectively correspond to arrangements which are viewed from an upper and a lower portion of the substrate in the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), however, as long as the number of the solder balls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is concerned, these drawings do not necessarily correspond to them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As shown in the drawings, concerning the side of the substrate on which the solder balls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are joined, with respect to plating leader line MP used as &ldquo;positional information&rdquo;, which is a part of the present invention, &ldquo;positional information&rdquo; is exposed outside through an insulating film such a the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. However, concerning the side of the substrate on which the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is mounted, since the entire face is covered with the sealing resin <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;positional information&rdquo; is not exposed outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (including the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into which the substrate is incorporated) having positional information relating to the first embodiment and the method of manufacturing the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, plating leader line MP is formed into a shape peculiar to each region in the periphery of each semiconductor element mounting region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is a region on which the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is finally mounted and this region is cut off as an individual semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This peculiar plating leader line MP is used as positional information to specify a position of each semiconductor element mounting region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, concerning the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, in the case where a breakdown is found in the delivery inspection conducted after the product has been assembled, or alternatively, in the case where a breakdown is found after the product has been delivered, it is possible to visually obtain a piece of peculiar positional information given to the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the case of a failure analysis. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it is possible to visually obtain a piece of peculiar positional information given to the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from the side on which the balls are joined. Therefore, it is possible to clearly specify a position at which the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> concerned is located when it is in a sheet state, which is a state in which the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is put before it is divided into each package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Due to the foregoing, it is possible to clearly judge whether the breakdown was caused by a specific position on the wiring substrate where the semiconductor device is located or the breakdown was caused by a specific process in the manufacturing process. It is possible to quickly feed back the result of a failure analysis to the manufacturing process. Therefore, the efficiency of failure analysis can be highly enhanced. Further, unlike the prior art, it becomes unnecessary to manually conduct marking such as scratching or make an experiment of reproducibility. Therefore, failure analysis can be executed more effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the above first embodiment, explanations are made of an example in which the mold gate sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are arranged being formed into a belt-shape along the periphery of the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having positional information. However, it should be noted that the arranging form of the mold gate sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is not limited to the above specific example. An example of the arranging form of the mold gate sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are plan views showing an arrangement of a wiring substrate having positional information of the second embodiment of the present invention. In the same manner as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> relating to the first embodiment, a wiring substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and a wiring substrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) having positional information are viewed from the side on which the chips are mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the drawings, reference numerals <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are regions in which the semiconductor elements are mounted, reference numerals <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are slits, reference numerals <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are solder resist layers which are protective films (insulating layers), and reference numerals <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are mold gate sections. On the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having positional information, the mold gate section <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is arranged corresponding to each semiconductor mounting region <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by one to one. Therefore, when the package is assembled, molding is conducted on the one corresponding semiconductor chip. On the other hand, on the wiring substrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having positional information, the mold gate sections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are arranged being formed into a belt-shape corresponding to groups of the matrix-shaped (1&times;2) regions. When the package is assembled, molding is conducted from each mold gate section <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the two corresponding semiconductor chips simultaneously and individually. In this connection, portions indicated by dotted lines represent cutting lines of the substrate. </paragraph>
