<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an anchor for boards for mounting an instrument or tool to a building material which does not provide screw retaining force such as a plasterboard or a plywood, or to a wall surface to the back of which hands cannot reach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a situation in which the building material itself is too thin and weak to mount a tool or instrument by directly tightening a screw, metal anchors are widely used. By tightening a screw, its leg portion spreads in all directions. Thus an operator can work on the front side only by forming a starting hole in the wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In such known anchors for boards, a screw is tightened from the operator&apos;s side to spread the leg portion on the backside of the wall surface, thereby fixing the anchor to the board. After removing the screw, an article to be fastened is fixed by re-tightening the screw. After the article has been mounted, if a load is applied to the article, the leg portion of the anchor for boards abuts the back of the wall. Since the plasterboard is formed by hardening plaster and covering it with paper, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the leg portion of the anchor may tear the paper on the back of the wall and sink into the plasterboard. Thus, due to breakage of the plasterboard, the article mounted may loosen or become shaky. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide an anchor for boards which prevents loosening and shaking, which will not break plasterboards, and which is easy to manufacture. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is provided an anchor for boards comprising a socket including a tubular portion, a plurality of split pieces integral with the tubular portion and having their intermediate portion slightly bent outwardly, the socket being integrally provided with a flange at one end thereof and a nut member at the other end thereof, and a screw inserted into the socket and threaded into the nut member, wherein the split pieces have their outer peripheral surfaces covered with a resilient member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the socket is inserted into the resilient member into contact with it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the resilient member is formed with as many slits as the split pieces so that the slits align with the split pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The resilient member may be made of a heat-shrinkable resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> From another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing the anchor for boards comprising the steps of cutting the resilient member to a suitable length beforehand, inserting the anchor into the resilient member so that the split pieces will be covered by the resilient member, and heating the resilient member to heat-shrink it onto the split pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> From another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing the anchor for boards comprising the steps of inserting the anchor into the resilient member so as to cover the split pieces, cutting the resilient member to a suitable length, and heating the resilient member to heat-shrink it onto the split pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> With this anchor for boards, since the metallic spread portion having a plurality of split pieces has its outer periphery covered with resin, due to its resilience, the resin acts as a buffer between the plasterboard and the metallic spread portion of the anchor. Thus, the anchor for boards according to the present invention will not damage the plasterboard and the member to be mounted can be reliably fixed to the wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to the method for manufacturing the anchor for boards, such anchors can be mass-produced easily. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of the anchor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> embodying the present invention. It comprises a socket <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a screw <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> inserted through the socket. The socket <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a tubular portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> integral with plurality of slightly outwardly bending split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> form a leg portion when spreaded. The split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have their outer peripheral surface covered with a resilient resin member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of a heat-shrinkable material such as resin. The socket <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at one end and a nut member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with female threads at the other end. If a viscous resin is applied as the resilient resin, it may be applied not only to the outer peripheral surface of the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, but also to the inner peripheral surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a second embodiment in which the socket <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has its outer periphery covered with a thin resilient resin member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Slits may be formed in the resilient resin member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> along the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> spread, the resilient member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> follows spreading of the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to keep covering their surfaces. As long as the resilient member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> does not hinder spreading of the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and is finally sandwiched between the back of the plasterboard <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to act as a buffer, its shape is not restricted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a third embodiment. The socket <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has its outer periphery covered with a strong resilient member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; formed with slits <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> along the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in such a shape as to follow their spreading and cover their outer peripheral surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows how the anchor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is used. A starting hole <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> having a predetermined diameter is formed in a plasterboard <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> beforehand. The anchor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is inserted into the hole <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. When the screw <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is tightened, the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be spreaded. When they spread, the screw <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned in a reverse direction and removed. Then, with an article <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be mounted in position, the screw <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is set and re-tightened with a tool <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a partial enlarged view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, showing how the resilient member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is partially held between the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the plasterboard <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to perform buffering function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> show one embodiment of the method according to the present invention. In this method, a hollow heat-shrinkable resilient member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having a larger inner diameter than the outer diameter of the socket <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is cut to suitable lengths. The anchor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is inserted into the resilient member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; so as to cover the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Then it is heated using a heating means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such as a heater or a hot air fan to heat-shrink the resilient member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that it will coat the outer peripheral surface of the split pieces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the anchor. With this arrangement, the socket <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has its outer periphery covered by the resilient member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The resilient member allows the spreading of the leg portion and keeps covering its outer peripheral surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Instead of cutting the resilient member beforehand, while the anchor is inserted into a long resilient member, the resilient member may be cut to a suitable length corresponding to the length of the anchor and be heated. The anchor having the resilient member thereon may be passed through a heated environment for a predetermined period of time by a continuous feed device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, due to the function of the resilient member which acts as a buffer between the soft plasterboard and the hard metal anchor, it is possible to avoid breakage of the plasterboard and prevent loosening or shaking of the article mounted. According to the present invention, the buffer portion is disposed between the anchor and the plasterboard, thereby imparting shrinkability and flexibility. This substantially increases the resistance to load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> By the method of manufacturing the anchor according to the present invention, such anchors can be easily mass-produced. </paragraph>
