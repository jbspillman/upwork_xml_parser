<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relate to an electroplating apparatus and method, and more particularly to an electroplating apparatus and method that can detect the film thickness of a metal film, which is being deposited on the surface, to be plated, of a substrate such as a semiconductor wafer by electroplating, in real time, such a state that the substrate is held by a substrate holding portion, thereby enabling the detection of the end point of plating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, instead of using aluminum or aluminum alloys as a material for forming interconnection circuits on a substrate such as a semiconductor wafer, there is an eminent movement towards using copper (Cu) which has a low electric resistance and high electromigration resistance. Copper interconnects are generally formed by filling fine recesses formed in the surface of a substrate with copper. There are known various techniques for forming such copper interconnects, including CVD, sputtering, and plating. According to any such technique, a copper film is formed in the substantially entire surface of a substrate, followed by removal of unnecessary copper by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A through 10C</cross-reference> illustrate, in sequence of process steps, an example of forming such a substrate W having copper interconnects. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, an insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such as an oxide film of Sio<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or a film of low-k material, is deposited on a conductive layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which electronic devices are formed, which is formed on a semiconductor base <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A contact hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a trench <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for interconnects are formed in the insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the lithography/etching technique. Thereafter, a barrier layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of TaN or the like is formed on the entire surface, and a seed layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as an electric supply layer for electroplating is formed on the barrier layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, copper plating is performed onto the surface of the substrate W to fill the contact hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the trench <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with copper and, at the same time, deposit a copper film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the copper film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the barrier layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are removed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) so as to make the surface of the copper film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> filled in the contact hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the trench <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for interconnects and the surface of the insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> lie substantially on the same plane. An interconnection composed of the copper film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</cross-reference> is thus formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With respect to electroplating, the film thickness of a plated film can be controlled by controlling the total supply of electricity at a predetermined level. Accordingly, it has been generally practiced to control the film thickness of a plated film at a desired level by controlling the plating current at a predetermined value and, in addition, by controlling the plating time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, in forming interconnects e.g. in a semiconductor device, particularly in forming copper interconnects by electroplating, the initial current value can change according to the initial state of a seed layer. When copper plating is carried out under control of the plating time but under such a changeable electric current, there may undesirably be a case where the plated film becomes too thick, leading to a prolonged polishing time in the next CMP step, or a case where the plated film becomes too thin, resulting in insufficient embedding of copper. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</cross-reference> show an electroplating apparatus for forming copper interconnects, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, by electroplating onto a surface, to be plated, of a substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer. The electroplating apparatus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is provided with a substrate treatment section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for performing plating treatment and its attendant treatment, and a plating solution tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for storing a plating solution is disposed adjacent to the substrate treatment section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. There is also provided an electrode arm portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having an electrode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is held at the front end of an arm <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> swingable about a rotating shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and which is swung between the substrate treatment section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the plating solution tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a precoating and recovery arm <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and fixed nozzles <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for ejecting pure water or a chemical liquid such as ion water, and further a gas or the like toward a semiconductor substrate are disposed laterally of the substrate treatment section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, three of the fixed nozzles <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are disposed, and one of them is used for supplying pure water. The substrate treatment section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, has a substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for holding a semiconductor substrate W with its surface to be plated facing upward, and a cathode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> located above the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> so as to surround a peripheral portion of the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Further, a substantially cylindrical bottomed cup <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> surrounding the periphery of the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for preventing scatter of various chemical liquids used during treatment is provided so as to be vertically movable by an air cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is adapted to be raised and lowered by the air cylinder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between a lower substrate transfer position A, an upper plating position B, and a pretreatment and cleaning position C intermediate between these positions. The substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is also adapted to rotate at an arbitrary acceleration and an arbitrary velocity integrally with the cathode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a rotating motor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a belt <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A substrate carry-in and carry-out opening (not shown) is provided in confrontation with the substrate transfer position A in a frame side surface of the electroplating apparatus facing the transferring robot (not shown). When the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is raised to the plating position B, a seal member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the cathode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are brought into contact with the peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor substrate W held by the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the cup <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has an upper end located below the substrate carry-in and carry-out opening, and when the cup <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> ascends, the upper end of the cup <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> reaches a position above the cathode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown by imaginary lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has ascended to the plating position B, the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is pressed against the peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor substrate W held by the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for thereby allowing electric current to pass through the semiconductor substrate W. At the same time, an inner peripheral end portion of the seal member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with an upper surface of the peripheral edge of the semiconductor substrate W under pressure to seal its contact portion in a watertight manner. As a result, the plating solution supplied onto the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate W is prevented from seeping from the end portion of the semiconductor substrate W, and the plating solution is prevented from contaminating the cathode electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an electrode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the electrode arm portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at a free end of a swing arm <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a hollow support frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> surrounding the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and an anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fixed by holding the peripheral edge portion of the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the support frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> covers an opening portion of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a suction chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed inside the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a plating solution introduction pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a plating solution discharge pipe (not shown) for introducing and discharging the plating solution are connected to the suction chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Further, many passage holes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>communicating with regions above and below the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided over the entire surface of the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a plating solution impregnated material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprising a water retaining material and covering the entire surface of the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached to the lower surface of the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The plating solution impregnated material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is impregnated with the plating solution to wet the surface of the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing a black film from falling onto the plated surface of the substrate, and simultaneously facilitating escape of air to the outside when the plating solution is poured between the surface, to be plated, of the substrate and the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The plating solution impregnated material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises, for example, a woven fabric, nonwoven fabric, or sponge-like structure comprising at least one material of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, polyvinyl chloride, Teflon, polyvinyl alcohol, polyurethane, and derivatives of these materials, or comprises a porous ceramics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Attachment of the plating solution impregnated material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is performed in the following manner: That is, many fixing pins <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> each having a head portion at the lower end are arranged such that the head portion is provided in the plating solution impregnated material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as not to be releasable upward and a shaft portion of the fixing pin pierces the interior of the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the fixing pins <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are urged upward by U-shaped leaf springs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, whereby the plating solution impregnated material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is brought in close contact with the lower surface of the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the resilient force of the leaf springs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and is attached to the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. With this arrangement, even when the thickness of the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> gradually decreases with the progress of plating, the plating solution impregnated material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be reliably brought in close contact with the lower surface of the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, it can be prevented that air enters between the lower surface of the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the plating solution impregnated material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to cause poor plating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, columnar pins made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) or PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and having a diameter of, for example, about 2 mm may be arranged from the upper surface side of the anode so as to pierce the anode, and an adhesive may be applied to the front end surface of each of the pins projecting from the lower surface of the anode to fix the anode to the plating solution impregnated material. The anode and the plating solution impregnated material may be used in contact with each other, but it is also possible to provide a gap between the anode and the plating solution impregnated material, and perform plating treatment while holding the plating solution in the gap. This gap is selected from a range of 20 mm or less, but is preferably selected from a range of 0.1 to 10 mm, and more preferably 1 to 7 mm. Particularly, when a soluble anode is used, the anode is dissolved from its lower portion. Thus, as time passes, the gap between the anode and the plating solution impregnated material enlarges and forms a gap in the range of 0 to about 20 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The electrode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> descends to such a degree that when the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is located at the plating position B (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), the gap between the substrate W held by the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the plating solution impregnated material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> reaches about 0.1 to 10 mm, preferably 0.3 to 3 mm, and more preferably about 0.5 to 1 mm. In this state, the plating solution is supplied from a plating solution supply pipe to be filled between the upper surface (surface to be plated) of the substrate W and the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while the plating solution impregnated material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is impregnated with the plating solution. The surface, to be plated, of the substrate W is plated by applying a voltage from a power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to between the upper surface (surface to be plated) of the substrate W and the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an equivalent electrical circuit of the copper electroplating apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When a voltage is applied from the power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to between the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (anodic electrode) and the seed layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (cathodic electrode, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) formed in the substrate W, the both electrodes being immersed in the plating solution, the electrical circuit formed has the following resistance components: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>: anodic polarization resistance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>: plating solution resistance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>: cathodic polarization resistance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>: sheet resistance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the film thickness of the seed layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is 25 nm, for example, the anodic polarization resistance R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be 7 m&OHgr;, the plating solution resistance R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be 32 m&OHgr;,the cathodic polarization resistance R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be 66 m&OHgr;, and the sheet resistance R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will be 585 m&OHgr;, the percentage of the sheet resistance R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> thus reaching 82% of the total resistance. The sheet resistance R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> decreases as the plated film being deposited on the seed layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, i.e. the copper film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), becomes thicker. When the sheet resistance R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> decreases with an increase in the film thickness of the plated film, in a case where the electric current flowing through the circuit is controlled at a constant value, the voltage gradually decreases, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and becomes nearly constant when the film thickness of the plated film reaches a certain level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In view of this, according to this embodiment, a voltage monitor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided within the circuit to monitor, in real time, the voltage applied between the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (anodic electrode) and the seed layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (cathodic electrode) when the electric current is controlled at a constant value, and detect the voltage consecutively so as to measure the film thickness of the plated film. The end point of electroplating can be detected by detecting the decrease of the voltage to a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Further according to this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> detection circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which connected at lease two cathode electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with the copper film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), can be formed by providing switches <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the wiring to the cathode electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and switching them. A detection power source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a current monitor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided in the detection circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. While the plating is interrupted and the switches <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are switched, a constant voltage is applied from the detection power source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the detection circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the electric current that flows through the detection circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is monitored and detected by the current monitor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to measure the film thickness of the plated film. The end point of electroplating can be detected by detecting the increase of the electric current to a predetermined value. In this regard, the electric current, which flows through the detection circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, changes with the change in the sheet resistance R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The change of electric current with the change of resistance can be made large by applying a high voltage to the circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. By plotting the current values detected, the film thickness of the copper film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be inferred and the end point of the electroplating can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Depending upon the plating conditions, there are a case where the end point of electroplating is detected in the region A, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in which the voltage applied between the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (anodic electrode) and the seed layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (cathodic electrode) from the power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> gradually decreases, and a case where the end point of electroplating is detected in the region B, shown in FIG. B, in which the voltage keeps nearly constant. According to this embodiment, the end point of electroplating in the voltage-decreasing region A is detected by the voltage monitor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the end point of electroplating in the region B is detected by the current monitor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The monitoring of voltage or electric current may also be practiced by calculating differential values thereof. After detecting that the voltage or electric current has reached a predetermined value, it is possible to carry out an additional plating for a predetermined time. Further, it is possible to use the monitored signals as a trigger for changing the plating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The plating treatment carried out in the electroplating apparatus of this embodiment will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> First, a semiconductor substrate W before the plating treatment is transferred by the transferring robot to the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the substrate transfer position A and placed on the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The cup <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is then raised and, at the same time, the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is raised to the pretreatment and cleaning position C. The precoating and recovery arm <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the retreat position is moved to a position where the precoating and recovery arm <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> faces the semiconductor substrate W, and a precoating solution, comprising e.g. a surfactant, is intermittently ejected from a precoating nozzle provided at the end of the precoating and recovery arm <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> onto the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W. The precoating is carried out while rotating the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, so that the precoating solution can spread over the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate W. After completion of the precoating, the precoating and recovery arm <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is returned to the retreat position, and the rotating speed of the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is increased to scatter by centrifugal force the precoating solution on the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W to thereby dry the substrate. Then, substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is raised to the plating position B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the electrode arm portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is swung horizontally so that the electrode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> moves from above the plating solution tray <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to above a position for plating, and then the electrode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is lowered toward the cathode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. After the electrode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has reached the plating position, a plating voltage is applied between the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the cathode portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, while a plating solution is fed inside the electrode portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and supplied to the plating solution impregnable material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through plating solution supply holes penetrating the anode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At this time, the plating solution impregnable material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is not in contact with but close to the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W generally at a distance of about 0.1 to 10 mm, preferably about 0.3 to 3 mm, more preferably about 0.5 to 1 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> When the supply of the plating solution is continued, the plating solution containing copper ions, oozing out of the plating solution impregnable material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, comes to fill the interstice between the plating solution impregnable material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W, whereupon Cu plating of the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W starts.

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The substrate plating apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> operates as follows: A semiconductor substrate W is supplied from the substrate cassette <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> placed in the loading unit <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> successively to one of the copper plating chambers <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. In one of the copper plating chamber <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, a plated copper film is formed on a surface of a semiconductor substrate W having an interconnection region composed of an interconnection trench and an interconnection hole (contact hole). The two copper plating chambers <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> are employed to allow the semiconductor substrate W to be plated with a copper film for a long period of time. Specifically, the semiconductor substrate W may be plated with a primary copper film according to electroless plating in one of the copper plating chamber <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, and then plated with a secondary copper film according to electroplating in the other copper plating chamber <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. The substrate plating apparatus may have more than two copper plating chambers. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A cassette <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> accommodating the semiconductor substrates W, in which a via hole and a trench for interconnect are formed, and a seed layer is formed thereon is placed on a loading port of the loading/unloading section <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. The first robot <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> takes out the semiconductor substrate W from the cassette <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and carries the semiconductor substrate W into the plated Cu film forming unit <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> where a plated Cu film is formed. At this time, the film thickness of the seed layer is measured with the before-plating and after-plating film thickness measuring instrument <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. The plated Cu film is formed by carrying out hydrophilic treatment of the face of the semiconductor substrate W, and then Cu plating. After formation of the plated Cu film, rinsing or cleaning of the semiconductor substrate W is carried out in the plated Cu film forming unit <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> When the semiconductor substrate W is taken out from the plated Cu film forming unit <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> by the first robot <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, the film thickness of the plated Cu film is measured with the before-plating and after-plating film thickness measuring instrument <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. The results of its measurement are recorded into a recording device (not shown) as record data on the semiconductor substrate, and are used for judgment of an abnormality of the plated Cu film forming unit <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. After measurement of the film thickness, the first robot <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> transfers the semiconductor substrate W to the reversing machine <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, and the reversing machine <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> reverses the semiconductor substrate W (the surface on which the plated Cu film has been formed faces downward). The first polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and the second polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> perform polishing in a serial mode and a parallel mode. Next, polishing in the serial mode will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the serial mode polishing, a primary polishing is performed by the polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, and a secondary polishing is performed by the polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. The second robot <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> picks up the semiconductor substrate W on the reversing machine <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, and places the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The top ring <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> attracts the semiconductor substrate Won the pusher <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by suction, and brings the surface of the plated Cu film of the semiconductor substrate W into contact with a polishing surface of the polishing table <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> under pressure to perform a primary polishing. With the primary polishing, the plated Cu film is basically polished. The polishing surface of the polishing table <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is composed of foamed polyurethane such as IC1000, or a material having abrasive grains fixed thereto or impregnated therein. Upon relative movements of the polishing surface and the semiconductor substrate W, the plated Cu film is polished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> After completion of polishing of the plated Cu film, the semiconductor substrate W is returned onto the pusher <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the top ring <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second robot <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> picks up the semiconductor substrate W, and introduces it into the first cleaning machine <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>. At this time, a chemical liquid may be ejected toward the face and backside of the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to remove particles therefrom or cause particles to be difficult to adhere thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> After completion of cleaning in the first cleaning machine <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>, the second robot <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> picks up the semiconductor substrate W, and places the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the second polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. The top ring <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> attracts the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by suction, and brings the surface of the semiconductor substrate W, which has the barrier layer formed thereon, into contact with a polishing surface of the polishing table <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> under pressure to perform the secondary polishing. The constitution of the polishing table is the same as the top ring <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. With this secondary polishing, the barrier layer is polished. However, there may be a case in which a Cu film and an oxide film left after the primary polishing are also polished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> A polishing surface of the polishing table <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is composed of foamed polyurethane such as IC1000, or a material having abrasive grains fixed thereto or impregnated therein. Upon relative movements of the polishing surface and the semiconductor substrate W, polishing is carried out. At this time, silica, alumina, ceria, or the like is used as abrasive grains or slurry. A chemical liquid is adjusted depending on the type of the film to be polished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Detection of an end point of the secondary polishing is performed by measuring the film thickness of the barrier layer mainly with the use of the optical film thickness measuring instrument, and detecting the film thickness which has become zero, or the surface of an insulating film comprising SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>shows up. Furthermore, a film thickness measuring instrument with an image processing function is used as the film thickness measuring instrument <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided near the polishing table <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. By use of this measuring instrument, measurement of the oxide film is made, the results are stored as processing records of the semiconductor substrate W, and used for judging whether the semiconductor substrate W in which secondary polishing has been finished can be transferred to a subsequent step or not. If the end point of the secondary polishing is not reached, re-polishing is performed. If over-polishing has been performed beyond a prescribed value due to any abnormality, then the semiconductor substrate processing apparatus is stopped to avoid next polishing so that defective products will not increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> After completion of the secondary polishing, the semiconductor substrate W is moved to the pusher <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the top ring <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second robot <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> picks up the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. At this time, a chemical liquid may be ejected toward the face and backside of the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to remove particles therefrom or cause particles to be difficult to adhere thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The second robot <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> carries the semiconductor substrate W into the second cleaning machine <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> where cleaning of the semiconductor substrate W is performed. The constitution of the second cleaning machine <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> is also the same as the constitution of the first cleaning machine <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>. The face of the semiconductor substrate W is scrubbed with the PVA sponge rolls using a cleaning liquid comprising pure water to which a surface active agent, a chelating agent, or a pH regulating agent is added. A strong chemical liquid such as DHF is ejected from a nozzle toward the backside of the semiconductor substrate W to perform etching of the diffused Cu thereon. If there is no problem of diffusion, scrubbing cleaning is performed with the PVA sponge rolls using the same chemical liquid as that used for the face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> After completion of the above cleaning, the second robot <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> picks up the semiconductor substrate W and transfers it to the reversing machine <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, and the reversing machine <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> reverses the semiconductor substrate W. The semiconductor substrate W which has been reversed is picked up by the first robot <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, and transferred to the third cleaning machine <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. In the third cleaning machine <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, megasonic water excited by ultrasonic vibrations is ejected toward the face of the semiconductor substrate W to clean the semiconductor substrate W. At this time, the face of the semiconductor substrate W may be cleaned with a known pencil type sponge using a cleaning liquid comprising pure water to which a surface active agent, a chelating agent, or a pH regulating agent is added.

In order to set a reference point for a position at which film thickness measurement is made, notch alignment for film thickness measurement is performed, and then film thickness data on the semiconductor substrate before formation of a Cu film are obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Then, the semiconductor substrate is transferred to the barrier layer forming unit <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> by the first robot <highlight><bold>831</bold></highlight>. The barrier layer forming unit <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> is such an apparatus for forming a barrier layer on the semiconductor substrate by electroless Ru plating, and the barrier layer forming unit <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> forms an Ru film as a film for preventing Cu from diffusing into an interlayer insulator film (e.g. SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) of a semiconductor device. The semiconductor substrate discharged after cleaning and drying steps is transferred by the first robot <highlight><bold>831</bold></highlight> to the first aligner and film thickness measuring instrument <highlight><bold>841</bold></highlight>, where the film thickness of the semiconductor substrate, i.e., the film thickness of the barrier layer is measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor substrate after film thickness measurement is carried into the seed layer forming unit <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> by the second robot <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>, and a seed layer is formed on the barrier layer by electroless Cu plating.

In the bevel and backside cleaning unit <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, the bevel is etched in a preset time, and Cu adhering to the backside of the semiconductor substrate is cleaned with a chemical liquid such as hydrofluoric acid. At this time, before transferring the semiconductor substrate to the bevel and backside cleaning unit <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, film thickness measurement of the semiconductor substrate may be made by the second aligner and film thickness measuring instrument <highlight><bold>842</bold></highlight> to obtain the thickness value of the Cu film formed by plating, and based on the obtained results, the bevel etching time may be changed arbitrarily to carry out etching. The region etched by bevel etching is a region which corresponds to a peripheral edge portion of the substrate and has no circuit formed therein, or a region which is not utilized finally as a chip although a circuit is formed. A bevel portion is included in this region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor substrate discharged after cleaning and drying steps in the bevel and backside cleaning unit <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> is transferred by the third robot <highlight><bold>833</bold></highlight> to the substrate reversing machine <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight>. After the semiconductor substrate is turned over by the substrate reversing machine <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight> to cause the plated surface to be directed downward, the semiconductor substrate is introduced into the annealing unit <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> by the fourth robot <highlight><bold>834</bold></highlight> for thereby stabilizing a interconnection portion. Before and/or after annealing treatment, the semiconductor substrate is carried into the second aligner and film thickness measuring instrument <highlight><bold>842</bold></highlight> where the film thickness of a copper film formed on the semiconductor substrate is measured.

<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The bevel and backside cleaning unit <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> can perform an edge (bevel) Cu etching and a backside cleaning at the same time, and can suppress growth of a natural oxide film of copper at the circuit formation portion on the surface of the substrate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> shows a schematic view of the bevel and backside cleaning unit <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the bevel and backside cleaning unit <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> has a substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> positioned inside a bottomed cylindrical waterproof cover <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> and adapted to rotate a substrate W at a high speed, in such a state that the face of the substrate W faces upwardly, while holding the substrate W horizontally by spin chucks <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> at a plurality of locations along a circumferential direction of a peripheral edge portion of the substrate, a center nozzle <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> placed above a nearly central portion of the face of the substrate W held by the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, and an edge nozzle <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> placed above the peripheral edge portion of the substrate W. The center nozzle <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and the edge nozzle <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> are directed downward. A back nozzle <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> is positioned below a nearly central portion of the backside of the substrate W, and directed upward. The edge nozzle <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> is adapted to be movable in a diametrical direction and a height direction of the substrate W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The width of movement L of the edge nozzle <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> is set such that the edge nozzle <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> can be arbitrarily positioned in a direction toward the center from the outer peripheral end surface of the substrate, and a set value for L is inputted according to the size, usage, or the like of the substrate W. Normally, an edge cut width C is set in the range of 2 mm to 5 mm. In the case where a rotational speed of the substrate is a certain value or higher at which the amount of liquid migration from the backside to the face is not problematic, the copper film within the edge cut width C can be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Next, the method of cleaning with this cleaning apparatus will be described. First, the semiconductor substrate W is horizontally rotated integrally with the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, with the substrate being held horizontally by the spin chucks <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> of the substrate holding portion <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>. In this state, an acid solution is supplied from the center nozzle <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> to the central portion of the face of the substrate W. The acid solution may be a non-oxidizing acid, and hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, or the like is used. On the other hand, an oxidizing agent solution is supplied continuously or intermittently from the edge nozzle <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> to the peripheral edge portion of the substrate W. As the oxidizing agent solution, one of an aqueous solution of ozone, an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide, an aqueous solution of nitric acid, and an aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite is used, or a combination of these is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the copper film, or the like formed on the upper surface and end surface in the region of the peripheral edge portion C of the semiconductor substrate W is rapidly oxidized with the oxidizing agent solution, and is simultaneously etched with the acid solution supplied from the center nozzle <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and spread on the entire face of the substrate, whereby it is dissolved and removed. By mixing the acid solution and the oxidizing agent solution at the peripheral edge portion of the substrate, a steep etching profile can be obtained, in comparison with a mixture of them which is produced in advance being supplied. At this time, the copper etching rate is determined by their concentrations. If a natural oxide film of copper is formed in the circuit-formed portion on the face of the substrate, this natural oxide is immediately removed by the acid solution spreading on the entire face of the substrate according to rotation of the substrate, and does not grow any more. After the supply of the acid solution from the center nozzle <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> is stopped, the supply of the oxidizing agent solution from the edge nozzle <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> is stopped. As a result, silicon exposed on the surface is oxidized, and deposition of copper can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, an oxidizing agent solution and a silicon oxide film etching agent are supplied simultaneously or alternately from the back nozzle <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> to the central portion of the backside of the substrate. Therefore, copper or the like adhering in a metal form to the backside of the semiconductor substrate W can be oxidized with the oxidizing agent solution, together with silicon of the substrate, and can be etched and removed with the silicon oxide film etching agent. This oxidizing agent solution is preferably the same as the oxidizing agent solution supplied to the face, because the types of chemicals are decreased in number. Hydrofluoric acid can be used as the silicon oxide film etching agent, and if hydrofluoric acid is used as the acid solution on the face of the substrate, the types of chemicals can be decreased in number. Thus, if the supply of the oxidizing agent is stopped first, a hydrophobic surface is obtained. If the etching agent solution is stopped first, a water-saturated surface (a hydrophilic surface) is obtained, and thus the backside surface can be adjusted to a condition which will satisfy the requirements of a subsequent process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the acid solution, i.e., etching solution is supplied to the substrate to remove metal ions remaining on the surface of the substrate W. Then, pure water is supplied to replace the etching solution with pure water and remove the etching solution, and then the substrate is dried by spin-drying. In this way, removal of the copper film in the edge cut width C at the peripheral edge portion on the face of the semiconductor substrate, and removal of copper contaminants on the backside are performed simultaneously to thus allow this treatment to be completed, for example, within 80 seconds. The etching cut width of the edge can be set arbitrarily (from 2 to 5 mm), but the time required for etching does not depend on the cut width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Annealing treatment performed before the CMP process and after plating has a favorable effect on the subsequent CMP treatment and on the electrical characteristics of interconnection. Observation of the surface of broad interconnection (unit of several micrometers) after the CMP treatment without annealing showed many defects such as microvoids, which resulted in an increase in the electrical resistance of the entire interconnection. Execution of annealing ameliorated the increase in the electrical resistance. In the presence of annealing, thin interconnection showed no voids. Thus, the degree of grain growth is presumed to be involved in these phenomena. That is, the following mechanism can be speculated: Grain growth is difficult to occur in thin interconnection. In broad interconnection, on the other hand, grain growth proceeds in accordance with annealing treatment. During the process of grain growth, ultra-fine pores in the plated film, which are too small to be seen by the SEM (scanning electron microscope), gather and move upward, thus forming microvoid-like depressions in the upper part of the interconnection. The annealing conditions in the annealing unit <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> are such that hydrogen (2% or less) is added in a gas atmosphere, the temperature is in the range of 300&deg; C. to 400&deg; C., and the time is in the range of 1 to 5 minutes. Under these conditions, the above effects were obtained. </paragraph>

The annealing unit <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> comprises a chamber <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> having a gate <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> for taking in and taking out the semiconductor substrate W, a hot plate <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> disposed at an upper position in the chamber <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> for heating the semiconductor substrate W to e.g. 400&deg; C., and a cool plate <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> disposed at a lower position in the chamber <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> for cooling the semiconductor substrate W by, for example, flowing a cooling water inside the plate.

<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The gas introduction pipe <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is connected to a mixed gas introduction line <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> which in turn is connected to a mixer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> where a N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas introduced through a N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas introduction line <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight> containing a filter <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and a H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas introduced through a H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas introduction line <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> containing a filter <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>are mixed to form a mixed gas which flows through the line <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> into the gas introduction pipe <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> In operation, the semiconductor substrate W, which has been carried in the chamber <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> through the gate <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, is held on the elevating pins <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> and the elevating pins <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> are raised up to a position at which the distance between the semiconductor substrate W held on the lifting pins <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> and the hot plate <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> becomes e.g. 0.1-1.0 mm. In this state, the semiconductor substrate W is then heated to e.g. 400&deg; C. through the hot plate <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, the antioxidant gas is introduced from the gas introduction pipe <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> and the gas is allowed to flow between the semiconductor substrate W and the hot plate <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> while the gas is discharged from the gas discharge pipe <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>, thereby annealing the semiconductor substrate W while preventing its oxidation. The annealing treatment may be completed in about several tens of seconds to 60 seconds. The heating temperature of the substrate may be selected in the range of 100-600&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> After the completion of the annealing, the elevating pins <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> are lowered down to a position at which the distance between the semiconductor substrate W held on the elevating pins <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> and the cool plate <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> becomes e.g. 0-0.5 mm. In this state, by introducing a cooling water into the cool plate <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, the semiconductor substrate W is cooled by the cool plate to a temperature of 100&deg; C. or lower in e.g. 10-60 seconds.

<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a schematic constitution drawing of the electroless plating apparatus. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, this electroless plating apparatus comprises holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> for holding a semiconductor substrate W to be plated on its upper surface, a dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> for contacting a peripheral edge portion of a surface to be plated (upper surface) of the semiconductor substrate W held by the holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> to seal the peripheral edge portion, and a shower head <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> for supplying a plating solution to the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W having the peripheral edge portion sealed with the dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight>. The electroless plating apparatus further comprises cleaning liquid supply means <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> disposed near an upper outer periphery of the holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> for supplying a cleaning liquid to the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W, a recovery vessel <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> for recovering a cleaning liquid or the like (plating waste liquid) discharged, a plating solution recovery nozzle <highlight><bold>965</bold></highlight> for sucking in and recovering the plating solution held on the semiconductor substrate W, and a motor M for rotationally driving the holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>. The respective members will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> has a substrate placing portion <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> on its upper surface for placing and holding the semiconductor substrate W. The substrate placing portion <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> is adapted to place and fix the semiconductor substrate W. Specifically, the substrate placing portion <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> has a vacuum attracting mechanism (not shown) for attracting the semiconductor substrate W to a backside thereof by vacuum suction. A backside heater <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight>, which is planar and heats the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W from underside to keep it warm, is installed on the backside of the substrate placing portion <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>. The backside heater <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> is composed of, for example, a rubber heater. This holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> is adapted to be rotated by the motor M and is movable vertically by raising and lowering means (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> is tubular, has a seal portion <highlight><bold>933</bold></highlight> provided in a lower portion thereof for sealing the outer peripheral edge of the semiconductor substrate W, and is installed so as not to move vertically from the illustrated position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> The shower head <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> is of a structure having many nozzles provided at the front end for scattering the supplied plating solution in a shower form and supplying it substantially uniformly to the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W. The cleaning liquid supply means <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> has a structure for ejecting a cleaning liquid from a nozzle <highlight><bold>953</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The plating solution recovery nozzle <highlight><bold>965</bold></highlight> is adapted to be movable upward and downward and swingable, and the front end of the plating solution recovery nozzle <highlight><bold>965</bold></highlight> is adapted to be lowered inwardly of the dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> located on the upper surface peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor substrate W and to suck in the plating solution on the semiconductor substrate W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the electroless plating apparatus will be described. First, the holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> is lowered from the illustrated state to provide a gap of a predetermined dimension between the holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> and the dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight>, and the semiconductor substrate W is placed on and fixed to the substrate placing portion <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>. An 8-inch substrate, for example, is used as the semiconductor substrate W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Then, the holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> is raised to bring its upper surface into contact with the lower surface of the dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> as illustrated, and the outer periphery of the semiconductor substrate W is sealed with the seal portion <highlight><bold>933</bold></highlight> of the dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight>. At this time, the surface of the semiconductor substrate W is in an open state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Then, the semiconductor substrate W itself is directly heated by the backside heater <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> to render the temperature of the semiconductor substrate W, for example, 70&deg; C. (maintained until termination of plating). Then, the plating solution heated, for example, to 50&deg; C. is ejected from the shower head <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> to pour the plating solution over substantially the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate W. Since the surface of the semiconductor substrate W is surrounded by the dame member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight>, the poured plating solution is all held on the surface of the semiconductor substrate W. The amount of the supplied plating solution may be a small amount which will become a 1 mm thickness (about 30 ml) on the surface of the semiconductor substrate W. The depth of the plating solution held on the surface to be plated may be 10 mm or less, and may be even 1 mm as in this embodiment. If a small amount of the supplied plating solution is sufficient, the heating apparatus for heating the plating solution may be of a small size. In this example, the temperature of the semiconductor substrate W is raised to 70&deg; C., and the temperature of the plating solution is raised to 50&deg; C. by heating. Thus, the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W becomes, for example, 60&deg; C., and hence a temperature optimal for a plating reaction in this example can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor substrate W is instantaneously rotated by the motor M to perform uniform liquid wetting of the surface to be plated, and then plating of the surface to be plated is performed in such a state that the semiconductor substrate W is in a stationary state. Specifically, the semiconductor substrate W is rotated at 100 rpm or less for only 1 second to uniformly wet the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W with the plating solution. Then, the semiconductor substrate W is kept stationary, and electroless plating is performed for 1 minute. The instantaneous rotating time is 10 seconds or less at the longest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> After completion of the plating treatment, the front end of the plating solution recovery nozzle <highlight><bold>965</bold></highlight> is lowered to an area near the inside of the dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> on the peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor substrate W to suck in the plating solution. At this time, if the semiconductor substrate W is rotated at a rotational speed of, for example, 100 rpm or less, the plating solution remaining on the semiconductor substrate W can be gathered in the portion of the dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> on the peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor substrate W under centrifugal force, so that recovery of the plating solution can be performed with a good efficiency and a high recovery rate. The holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> is lowered to separate the semiconductor substrate W from the dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor substrate W is started to be rotated, and the cleaning liquid (ultra-pure water) is jetted at the plated surface of the semiconductor substrate W from the nozzle <highlight><bold>953</bold></highlight> of the cleaning liquid supply means <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> to cool the plated surface, and simultaneously perform dilution and cleaning, thereby stopping the electroless plating reaction. At this time, the cleaning liquid jetted from the nozzle <highlight><bold>953</bold></highlight> may be supplied to the dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> to perform cleaning of the dam member <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> at the same time. The plating waste liquid at this time is recovered into the recovery vessel <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> and discarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Then, the semiconductor substrate W is rotated at a high speed by the motor M for spin-drying, and then the semiconductor substrate W is removed from the holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is a schematic constitution drawing of another electroless plating apparatus. The electroless plating apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is different from the electroless plating apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> in that instead of providing the backside heater <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> in the holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>, lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> are disposed above the holding means <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>, and the lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> and a shower head <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are integrated. For example, a plurality of ring-shaped lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> having different radii are provided concentrically, and many nozzles <highlight><bold>943</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the shower head <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are open in a ring form from the gaps between the lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight>. The lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> may be composed of a single spiral lamp heater, or may be composed of other lamp heaters of various structures and arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Even with this constitution, the plating solution can be supplied from each nozzle <highlight><bold>943</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W substantially uniformly in a shower form. Further, heating and heat retention of the semiconductor substrate W can be performed by the lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> directly uniformly. The lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> heat not only the semiconductor substrate W and the plating solution, but also ambient air, thus exhibiting a heat retention effect on the semiconductor substrate W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Direct heating of the semiconductor substrate W by the lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> requires the lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> with a relatively large electric power consumption. In place of such lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight>, lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> with a relatively small electric power consumption and the backside heater <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> may be used in combination to heat the semiconductor substrate W mainly with the backside heater <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> and to perform heat retention of the plating solution and ambient air mainly by the lamp heaters <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight>. In the same manner as in the aforementioned embodiment, means for directly or indirectly cooling the semiconductor substrate W may be provided to perform temperature control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The cap plating described above is preferably performed by electroless plating process, but may be performed by electroplating process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Although certain preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described in detail, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
