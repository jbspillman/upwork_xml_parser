<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device-socket useable for testing a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices mounted on an electronic equipment or others are subjected to various tests at a stage prior to being actually mounted so that latent defects therein are removed. The test is performed nondestructively through application of voltage stress, high-temperature operation, and high-temperature storage corresponding to thermal and mechanical environment tests or the like. Among these tests, there is a burn-in test effective for removing initial-inoperable integrated circuits, in which an operation test is performed under a high temperature condition for a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor device-socket subjected to such a test as disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3059946 and as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, for example, is disposed on a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that includes an input/output portion, to which portion a predetermined test voltage is supplied and which portion outputs an abnormality-detection signal representing a short-circuit or others is returned from the semiconductor device as an object to be tested and the abnormality detection signal is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor device-socket comprises a socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for accommodatinging the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> relatively movably with respect to a pair of the contact portion of the contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai</italic></highlight>; a positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including an accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which a BGA-type (Ball Grid Array) semiconductor device is loaded as the semiconductor device for example; a contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for supporting the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arranged in a socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> movably as described later in a reciprocating fashion in a predetermined direction and bringing one of movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M of a contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>described later into close proximity to the other of contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F or keeping the one away from the other; and a frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for transmitting operation force acting on itself to the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through a driving mechanism of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> At a predetermined position on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed a group of electrodes connected electrically to the input/output portion through a conductor layer. To the electrode group is connected a terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B on a proximal end side of a plurality of the contact terminals <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>(i&equals;1 to n, n is a positive integer.) provided on the socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> disposed on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has thereinside an accommodation portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from which the movable contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F of a plurality of the contact terminals <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>are protruded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai</italic></highlight>, which is provided corresponding to each electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a mounted semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, comprises a terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B on the side of the proximal end and a pair of movable contact portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M that are coupled with the just-mentioned terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B for selectively supporting each electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The pair of the movable contact portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M approach each other in response to the movement of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to pinch each electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or are separated from each other to release each electrode portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is disposed movably in the movement direction of the movable contact portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>in the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has an opening through which the movable contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>are protruded. Each opening is divided with a partition wall (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A partition wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>p </italic></highlight>is provided as a movable contact press portion, in each opening portion from which the movable contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>in the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are protruded, which portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>p </italic></highlight>is formed so as to divide a space between the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M and the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F. Further, between the one end of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the inner periphery of the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided an urging member (not shown) for urging the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to return the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to an initial position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> recessed portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided in an upper end of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> on which a bottom of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is placed, with which a protrusion lop of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is engaged when the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved in one direction. As shown therefore in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>, the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is adapted to be relatively slidable in a predetermined region with respect to the bottom of the contact deviation member and the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and is moved together with the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is coupled to a driving mechanism composed of a pin and a lever as disclosed in the foregoing Japanese Patent No. 3059946. One end of the lever of the driving mechanism makes contact with an end of the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved against the urging force of the coiled spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by an arrow illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> in response to the lowering operation of the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by an arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the partition wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>P is moved so as to separate the movable contact portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai </italic></highlight>from the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F. In contrast, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved with the aid of the urging force of the biasing means and the restoring force of the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M oppositely to the direction indicated by the arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> in response to rising operation of the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the center thereof, in which the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted. An inner peripheral surface of the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comprises flat surfaces with which end surfaces of the square semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> make contact, and a slope that combines the upper end surface and the flat surface, and further a bottom surface intersecting the flat surface. The size of the inner peripheral surface of the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is set larger than the size of an external appearance of the mounted semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> mounted within a predetermined tolerance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the bottom of the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed an opening lob communicated with the opening in the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The protrusion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>p </italic></highlight>that engages a peripheral edge of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed at a portion of the bottom of the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>opposing to the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Further, protrusions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ca </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>cb </italic></highlight>are formed on both ends of the bottom of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the opposite side of the socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the protrusions being guided and restricted by grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ga </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>gb </italic></highlight>in the socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has thereinside an opening to surround an outer periphery of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is supported on the socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> movably up and down with respect to the socket body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When in such a structure, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is in the state just before it is held with the hand HA of the conveyance robot (not shown) and is accommodated in the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is held with the hand HA of the conveyance robot such that an axis center of the hand HA of the conveyance robot and the center of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are coincident with each other. In that case, the protrusion lop of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the peripheral edge of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are made a disengagement state each other. Further, the hand HA of the conveyance robot is disposed such that the position of the axis center of the hand HA is displaced by a predetermined distance AH to the left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> with respect to the center position of the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the held semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is mounted in the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the frame member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is first moved downward up to a lowest end position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> with the press portion PU of the conveyance robot and the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is moved downward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved against the urging force of the urging means. Further, the protrusion lop of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the peripheral edge of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are brought into an engagement state, whereby the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved until the protrusion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ca </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>cb </italic></highlight>of the positioning member collide with closed ends of the grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ga </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>gb</italic></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Next, referring then to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, in the state of the partition wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>P where it is moved and held such that the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M of the each contact terminal is separated from the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is mounted in the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, whereby the electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is positioned between the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M or and movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Since in that case the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved by a predetermined distance, the hand HA of the conveyance robot is moveed downward as indicated by a chain double-dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> in response to the movement of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the state where the position CL of the axis center of the hand HA and the center position of the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are coincident with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is moved upward as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> in the state where each electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disposed between the movable contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F of each contact terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ai</italic></highlight>, the contact deviation member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved up to the initial position with the aid of the urging force of the urging means and the restoring force of the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M, whereby the partition wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>P is separated from the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M and comes in contact with the movable contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>F.

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> There is however a situation where any end of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> interferes with the inner periphery of the accommodation portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> owing to a positional displacement of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> based upon manufacturing error of respective constituent parts associated with the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during the movements of the hand HA of the conveyance robot, the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Such a problem can be eliminated provided that the frame member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is lowered up to a lowest end position and the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved until the protrusions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ca </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>cb </italic></highlight>collide open ends of the grooves <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ga </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>gb</italic></highlight>, and then the hand HA of the conveyance robot that holds the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is moved with a delay, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, for example.

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is furthermore difficult in mass production in view of production efficiency to replace a new respective constituent parts associated with the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for correcting the positional displacement of the positioning member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.
