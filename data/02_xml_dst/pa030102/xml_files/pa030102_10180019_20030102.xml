<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-200017, filed Jun. 29, 2001, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a disc access apparatus and method for gaining access to, for example, a CD-ROM (Compact Disc ROM) having compressed music data files, etc., recorded therein and a CD-R (Compact Disc Recordable) having recorded music data files, etc., created by a computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, various music data file compression techniques have been developed alongside the rapid advances in digital audio. As such compression techniques, there are MP3 (MPEG-1, Audio layer-III), AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), WMA (Windows Media Audio) and so on. Further, CD-ROMs with recorded music data files compressed by the use of such compression techniques are commercially available and CD-Rs are available in which music data files compressed by the use of a personal computer are recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the case of the audio CD, the number of programs recordable in the CD is restricted to 99 at max. In the case where a music data file (hereinafter referred to as an MP3 file) is recorded as a file compressed by, for example, MP3 in the CD-ROM and CD-R, the number of recordable programs, that is, the number of MP files, is practically unlimited. It is, therefore, possible to record a greater number of programs in the CD-ROM and CD-R as long as the recording capacity allows it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> diagrammatically shows the logic format of a CD-ROM. This logic format controls a file with the use of a directory or folder concept. Here, it is to be noted that the directory and folder are used to mean the same thing. The address of a plurality of folders 1, 2, . . . , n, with an MP3 file stored therein, together with the address of the root directory, are recorded in a path table. The address of each folder and address of the root directory are managed with the use of the path table. Although, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the folders are shown as constituting a one-layer structure, if any subfolders are provided in the respective folder, the address of the subfolder is managed by the path table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the case where, in the logic format thus arranged, a required MP3 file is to be searched, it is necessary to sequentially trace the root directory, folder and MP file by referring to the path table. It, therefore, takes longer to make such a search. For this reason, in the case where, in particular, any program largely distant from a currently played-back program is reproduced without sequentially reproducing continuous programs, it takes longer to reach that program for reproduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is considered that, when a CD-ROM or CD-R is set in a reproducing device for reproduction, a table is created in an initializing stage which can gain direct access to a memory of the reproducing apparatus to get an MP3 file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows one form of a table FAT created in a memory. The table FAT comprises file names of the MP3 file and addresses representing, for example, head addresses of the MP3 file. In the table FAT, the file name and address are stored in a way to correspond to a given program. Such a table is created in the initializing stage with the CD-ROM or CD-R set in the reproduction device. When a desired program number is designated, direct access can be made to the MP3 file corresponding to the program number by referring to the table. Therefore, it is possible to search a desired program at high speed. Further, the file name (program name) can be displayed by reading out a file name corresponding to the searched program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In general, however, the address of the file is allowed to have a length of a few bytes and the file name is allowed to have a length of, for example, about 128 bytes. Further, the number of files recorded in the CD-ROM or CD-R is substantially unlimited. For this reason, there is a problem that, when many files are involved, the size of the table becomes greater and it is necessary to provide a memory section of a greater capacity. Therefore, a need is created for a disc access apparatus and method which, even if a greater number of files are involved, can achieve a high-speed search and require no memory section of a greater capacity. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a disc access apparatus according to one embodiment of the present embodiment. This apparatus is based on for example, a portable type CD player, but is not restricted to the portable type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a CD-ROM, a CD-R and audio CD. The CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is loaded into a reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a conventionally known apparatus for reproducing data recorded in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and has an optical pick-up, not shown, a CD processor (CDP) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a digital/analog converter (DAC) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The optical pick-up directs a laser beam to the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> set in the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and converts the light beam which is reflected from the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to an electric signal and outputs it. The output signal from the optical pick-up is supplied to the CDP <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The CDP <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>produces a 16 bits&times;2 channels&times;44.1 kHz signal per second from a signal supplied from the optical pick-up. In the case where the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> set in the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of an audio CD, an output signal from the CDP <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a digital stereophonic signal of the above-mentioned bit rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the case where the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> set in the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of a CD-ROM or CD-R, an output signal from the CDP <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a 2-channel digital signal having the above-mentioned bit rate and contains, for example, a folder and MP3 file. The logic format of the CD-ROM and CD-R is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The DAC <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>converts the above-mentioned digital stereophonic signal to an analog stereophonic signal. In the case where an audio CD is set in the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the digital stereophonic signal which is outputted from the CDP <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is converted by the DAC <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to an analog stereophonic signal. The analog stereophonic signal can be reproduced by connecting, for example, a headphone <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the output terminal of the DAC <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned digital signal which is outputted from the CDP <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is supplied to the digital signal processor (DSP) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The DSP <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes, for example, a CD-ROM decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a file management section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, MP3 decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a DAC <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. A memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is connected to the DSP <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is comprised of, for example, a static RAM (SRAM). The memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a buffer memory BFM and, further, stores a song table SGT and folder address table FoAT as will be described later. A signal which is outputted from the CDP <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is stored in the buffer memory BFM of the memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The CD-ROM decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>descrambles the digital signal stored in the buffer memory BFM and performs an error correction. The file management section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>searches the MP3 file by an output signal of the CD-ROM decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The MP3 decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>decodes the MP3 file searched by the file management section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This signal is supplied to, for example, a DAC <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and converted to an analog stereophonic signal. Therefore, the analog stereophonic signal can be reproduced by connecting, for example, a headphone <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to an output terminal of the DAC <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The output signal of the MP3 decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>can be sent back to the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this case, the digital stereophonic signal which is outputted from the MP3 decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C is converted to the analog stereophonic signal by means of the DAC <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and it can be reproduced by the headphone <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and DSP <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are connected to a CPU <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> serving as a controller. An operation panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and has, for example, play-back, pause, skip keys and ten keys. The CPU <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> controls the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, DSP <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and operation panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. For example, the CPU <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> controls, in response to the operation of the operation panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the search of the MP3 file recorded on the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a play-back operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The operation will be described below with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is one example of a logic format of data recorded on the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Here, only a path table PT and a plurality of folders managed by the path table PT are shown. The MP3 file is contained in the respective folder. The number of files in the folder is not restricted to 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In order to be able to search a required program at high speed even if the number of data (programs) able to gain direct access to the corresponding addresses exceeds a predetermined program number in this embodiment, a song table SGT and folder address table FoAT are created in the memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a practical example of the song table SGT and of the folder address table FoAT. The address of the folders recorded in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are sequentially recorded in the folder address table FoAT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the song table SGT has a memory capacity of, for example, 16 bits/word&times;64 words, that is, 1024 bits, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The song table SGT is such that a respective MP3 file in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> corresponds to each bit as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The respective bit corresponds to the MP3 file in the folder which corresponds to the folder address recorded in the folder address table FoAT. Further, each bit is set to &ldquo;1&rdquo; when its corresponding MP3 file is a first program in the folder and to &ldquo;0&rdquo; when its corresponding MP3 file is not a first program. That is, in the song table SGT, the bit in which &ldquo;1&rdquo; is set shows a folder boundary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Those folder addresses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the holder address table FoAT as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> correspond to the folders <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and those up to a fifth bit position in the song table SGT correspond to the MP3 file in the folders <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, in the folder address table FoAT, the folder name may be stored in a way to correspond to the respective folder address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an operation for creating the song table SGT and folder address table FoAT. The song table SGT and folder address table FoAT are created, for example, in an initializing stage when the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is set to the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> First, the address of the first folder is read out by the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the path table of the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). The read-out folder address is supplied to the memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and written into the folder address table FoAT (ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Then the folder corresponding to the read-out folder address is read out from the CD<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). After this, the file in the folder thus read out is read out from the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). It is decided whether or not the read-out file is the MP3 file (ST<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). That is, if the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a CD-R, it is necessary to detect only the MP3 file because there is a possibility that any file other than the MP3 file will be recorded in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. If that file is decided as a file other that the MP3 file, then the next file is read in (ST<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> If, on the other hand, the above-mentioned file is decided as the MP3 file, this MP3 file is decided as to whether or not it is the first program in the folder (ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). If YES, &ldquo;1&rdquo; is set to a bit position corresponding to this file in the song table SGT (ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). If NO, &ldquo;0&rdquo; is set to the bit position corresponding to this file in the song table SGT (ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When the processing of one file is thus completed, then it is decided whether or not the reading-in of all the files in that folder has been completed (ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). If NO, the next file is read in and the above-mentioned operation is performed (ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). If YES as a result of decision, it is decided whether or not the reading-in of all the folders in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has been completed (ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). If NO, the next file is read in and the same operation as set out above is performed (ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). If YES, the process is ended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> By doing so, the song table SGT and folder address table FoAT are created in the memory FoAT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The accessing of the MP3 file recorded in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be described below with the use of the song table SGT and folder address table FoAT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing the operation of gaining access to the MP3 file. Here, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an explanation will be made below about the operation of designating, for example, a fifth program via the ten keys in the operation panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the fifth program &ldquo;0005.mp3&rdquo; corresponds to a second program in the folder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the case where the MP3 file recorded in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is accessed with the use of the song table SGT and folder address table FoAT, &ldquo;1&rdquo; set in the song table SGT is counted to detect a folder boundary and access is gained to a file in the corresponding folder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> That is, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, first, a counter &ldquo;i&rdquo; for counting a program number is reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo; and a counter &ldquo;f&rdquo; for counting the folder number is reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo; (ST<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> After this, the folder number is counted (ST<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) and the program number is counted (ST<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). The counter &ldquo;f&rdquo; counts the folder number by counting the content (SGT&lsqb;i&rsqb;) of the bit position of the song table SGT designated by the counter &ldquo;1&rdquo;. That is, when the value of the counter &ldquo;i&rdquo; is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, then the value of the &ldquo;1&rdquo; bit position of the song table SGT is &ldquo;1&rdquo;. For this reason, the value of the counter &ldquo;f&rdquo; is &ldquo;1&rdquo;. In this way, the folder number is counted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Then, it is decided whether or not the value of the program number counter &ldquo;i&rdquo; is equal to, or greater than, the designated program number (ST<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). If, as a result of decision, the value of the program number counter &ldquo;i&rdquo; is less than the designated program number, the counter &ldquo;i&rdquo; is counted up and, with this, the counter &ldquo;f&rdquo; is also counted up in accordance with the value of the song table SGT (ST<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If, on the other hand, the value of the counter &ldquo;i&rdquo; is equal to, or greater than, the designated program number, then a folder address is read out from the folder address table FoAT at a position corresponding to a value of the counter &ldquo;f&rdquo; (ST<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>). In this case, when the value of the counter &ldquo;i&rdquo; is &ldquo;5&rdquo;, the value of the counter &ldquo;f&rdquo; is &ldquo;3&rdquo; and a third folder address <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is read out from the folder address table FoAT. This read-out folder address <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is supplied from the memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the reproducing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is accessed in accordance with the folder address <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (ST<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). That is, based on the folder address <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a corresponding folder in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is accessed to read out a desired MP3 file in the folder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to the above-mentioned embodiment, the memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes the folder address table FoAT for sequentially recording folder addresses recorded in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the song table SGT with a respective MP3 file in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> corresponding to the bit. In order to represent a folder boundary, the respective bit of the song table SGT is set to data &ldquo;1&rdquo; in the case where the MP3 file corresponds to the first program in the folder and to data &ldquo;0&rdquo; in the case where the respective bit of the song table SGT is not the first program. If, therefore, a desired program number is designated, the data &ldquo;1&rdquo; representing the folder boundary set in the song table SGT counted and, by doing so, the folder number corresponding to its program number can be detected at high speed. Further, the address of the folder corresponding to the folder number is read out from the folder address table FoAT and, by gaining access to the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the read-out folder address, it is possible to access the MP3 file corresponding to the designated program number at high speed. It is also possible to reduce the wait time for a selected program even in the case where, for example, a program very far from a currently selected program is to be played back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Further, the song table SGT created in the memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> need only have a bit number capacity corresponding to the number of MP3 files in the CD <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the folder address table FoAT need only have a capacity capable of storing those addresses corresponding to the number of folders involved. Therefore, the song table SGT and folder address table FoAT may have much less storage capacities than the capacity of the table shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and have an advantage of being capable of reducing the storage capacity of the memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the above-mentioned song table SGT need not have a restricted capacity corresponding to, for example, the first to 256th programs. That is, if the memory capacity is permitted, it is possible to apply a searching method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> to the above-mentioned practical form of the present invention. If this method is adopted, it is possible to apply the searching method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> to the first to 256th programs at high speed and, if access is gained to more than 256 programs, to adopt the above-mentioned procedure. By doing so it is possible to prevent a searching rate from being lowered to an extreme extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a variant of the above-mentioned embodiment. In this variant, a check bit CB format corresponding to each word is added to, for example, an LSB side of a song table SGT. This check bit CB format is comprised of, for example, a plurality of bits. By the addition of the check bits CB it is possible to verify the reliability of the song table SGT in word units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Although the above-mentioned embodiment has been explained as being applied to the CD-ROM and CD-R having recorded an MP3 file, this invention is not restricted to the recording file format of MP3, and is applicable to other file formats such as AAC or WMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Further, the CD is not restricted to CD-ROM and CD-R and the present invention is applicable to the use of CD-RW (Compact Disc Rewritable) and MD (Mini Disc). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
