<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates a depositing method and a surface modifying method for nano-particles in a gas stream and, more in particular, it relates to a depositing method and a surface modifying method for nano-particles in a gas stream capable of efficiently depositing nano-particles with a particle diameter of less than 100 nm for which development of various functions not obtainable in their bulk state can be expected based on the quantum size effect under a charged state in a gas streams, and capable of the modifying the surface of the nano-particles which are extremely sensitive to defects or impurities caused by a large exposure ratio of surface atoms at a good controllability in the gas stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When a material is reduced into the size of nano-particles having a particle diameter of less than 100 nm, it sometimes develops physical property and function not shown in the bulk state thereof. Referring, for example, to the light emitting function, it has been known that even group IV elements such as silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) which are indirect transition semiconductor and scarcely emit light in their bulk state emit intense visible lights at a room temperature when they are reduced into nano-particles of several nm diameter. However, since the ratio of atoms exposed on the surface is extremely large in nano-particles (reaching 40% at the grain diameter of 5 nm), the nano-particles are extremely sensitive to the intrusion of impurities or presence of crystal defects and it has been so far considered difficult for the development of them into high functional devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, in a case of Si nano-particles, it is described that Si nano-particles formed in an atmospheric gas show a quantum size effect as the optical characteristic which is not obtainable in their bulk state as shown in the literature (&ldquo;Structures and Optical Properties of Silicon Nanocrystals Prepared by Pulsed-Laser Ablation in Inert Background Gas&rdquo;, Appl. Phys. Lett. Vol. 76 pp 1389-1391, 2000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When nano-particles in a state charged to single polarity are deposited, deposits are charged as the amount of deposition increases, particularly, in semiconductors or insulator materials, in which repulsion exerts between nano-particles and deposits, and the amount of deposition is sometimes saturated when deposition is conducted to a predetermined amount or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, in a case of using nano-particles as they are or by assembling nano-particles for functional materials or functional devices, it is necessary to suppress coalescence and agglomeration of nano-particles and arranging them irregularly or regularly in a predetermined pattern on a substrate in order to possess the functionality inherent to the size. However, since the nano-particles of the size concerned in this invention has high surface activity and remarkable lattice-softening or melting effect on the surface, it has been difficult by the existent method for suppression of coalescence and agglomeration, or regular or irregular arrangement. In a case where nano-particles or an assembly of nano-particles as functional materials or functional devices, it is necessary for treatments to further emphasize the characteristic of the nano-particles or provide different kinds of functions. However, the treatment mentioned above tends to deteriorate the characteristic inherent to the nano-particles. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of a deposition method and a surface modifying method for nano-particles in a gas stream according to this invention will be explained in details with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view illustrating a main portion for the constitution of a nano-particle deposition/modification apparatus used for practicing a deposition method and a surface modifying method for nano-particles according to this invention. The nano-particles deposition/modification apparatus comprises a gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for mixing a first gas species carrying nano-particles and a second gas species for applying surface modification to the nano-particles, and a nano-particles collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> connected with the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> comprises an atmospheric gas inlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for introducing a mixture of a gas as the first gas species and nano-particles, a gas exits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for flowing out the gas mixture, and a gas introduction portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for introducing a gas as the second gas species into gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, a helium gas is used as the first gas species, while an oxygen gas is used as the second gas species, for instance. Then, an oxygen gas reservoir <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for supplying an oxygen gas to the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is connected to the gas introduction portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Further, the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is provided with a porous ceramic body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for introducing an oxygen gas at a predetermined mass flow rate (0.01 SLM) from the oxygen gas reservoir <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> disposed to the gas introduction portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the inside of the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and an IR-ray introduction window <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> for introducing radiated IR-rays <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the inside of the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. An appropriate light guiding material such as synthetic quartz is used for the IR-ray introduction window <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connected by way of a gas line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprises a nozzle <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> disposed to the top end of the gas line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a deposition substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on which nano-particles in the gas mixture entering from the nozzle <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to the inside of the nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are deposited, a laser light introduction window <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> for introducing an excimer laser light <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the inside of the nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a deflection mirror <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> for deflecting an optical path of the excimer laser light <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> introduced into the nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at a predetermined angle in the chamber and irradiating the same onto the flow path of the gas mixture containing the nano-particles, and an electron beam irradiation device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> for irradiating an electron beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, separately, from the excimer laser light <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, to the inside of the nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The operation of the nano-particle deposition/modification apparatus having thus been constituted is to be explained below. Deposition of nano-particles in a charged state in a gas stream is to be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. At first, silicon nano-particles (particle diameter: 3 nm) formed by laser ablation in inert background gas method or a sputtering method and controlled a size distribution of nano-particles, for example, by a differential electrical mobility analyzing method and they are introduced together with the helium gas <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at high purity (impurity concentration: 0.5 ppb or less) which is an atmospheric gas during formation and flowing at a predetermined mass flow rate (1.0 SLM) by way of the nozzle <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> into the nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As the starting material for the nano-particles, silicon is mentioned, for example, but the starting material for the nano-particles has no particular restriction and germanium which is a group IV semiconductor or compounds of metal, oxides, nitrides such as tungsten or platinum having high melting points may also be used, like silicon, as the starting material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, an orifice <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is disposed to the nozzle <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. When the diameter for the orifice <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is chosen appropriately (for example, 1 mm diameter) and the nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is pumped by differential operation by using a variable conductance exhaust system of large exhaustion flow rate using, for example, a helical pump (exhaust capacity of 440 l/s), the pressure Pn in the nozzle and the pressure Pd in the nano-particle collection/deposition chamber can be controlled, for example, as Pn&equals;5.0 Torr and Pd&equals;1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Torr. By increasing the pressure difference, the inertial force of the nano-particles <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in the gas stream can be increased and the nano-particles <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be centrally deposited locally on the deposition substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Then, the nano-particles <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> jetted out of the nozzle <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are collected and deposited on the deposition substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), static charges can be released to the deposition substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at the initial stage of deposition and, along with increase of the deposition amount, they are brought into a charged stage. This is identical also in a case where the starting material is an insulator. Repulsion exerts between the charged deposits <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the charged nano-particles <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and, as a result, the deposition amount is decreased tending to reach saturation. In view of the above, for suppressing the saturation of the deposition amount, the electron beam irradiation device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is disposed in the nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. When the electron beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is irradiated to the charged nano-particles <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, charged nano-particles <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are converted into neutralized nano-particles <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and collected/deposited by the inertial force in the gas stream described above with no saturation of the deposition amount on the deposition substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. By eliminating the repulsion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> exerting between the charged nano-particles <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the deposits <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the deposition amount per unit time can also be estimated and, thus, the deposition amount can be controlled exactly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Then, surface modification for the nano-particles in the gas stream is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. At first, silicon nano-particles (particle diameter: 3 nm) formed, for example, by pulsed laser ablation in inert background gas method or a sputtering method and controlled the size distribution of nano-particles, for example, by a differential electrical mobility analyzing method or the like are entered together with the helium has <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at a high purity (impurity concentration: 0.5 ppb or less), which is an atmospheric gas upon formation and flows at a predetermined gas flow rate (0.99 SLM) into the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is provided, for example, with the porous ceramic body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for introducing an oxygen gas at a predetermined mass flow rate (0.01 SLM) from the oxygen gas reservoir <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and an IR-ray introduction window <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> for introducing irradiated IR-ray <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. While oxygen is referred to as an example of the gas species for surface modification, the gas species has no particular restriction only thereto but it may be nitrogen or hydrogen, or an aerosol containing organic molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Then, the helium gas <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> containing the nano-particles entering into the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is mixed with an oxygen gas introduced through the porous ceramic body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the gas mixture containing the nano-particles enters by way of the nozzle <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> at a predetermined mass flow rate (1.0 SLM) by way of the nozzle <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> into the nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The nano-particles <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> jetted out of the nozzle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are collected/deposited on the deposition substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), since the deposits <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> have high surface activity as the characteristic of the nano-particles and the lattice-softening effect or the melting effect on the surface are remarkable, coalescence or agglomeration occurs tending to form coalescence/coagulation products <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> that hinder the development of function of the single nano-particle single body (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, for suppressing the occurrence of agglomeration or coalescence and maintaining the individual independence of nano-particles, the laser light introduction window <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is disposed to the nano-particle collection/deposition chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the excimer laser light <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> shaped into 10 mm square (ArF excimer laser: at 193 nm wavelength) is deflected at the deflecting mirror <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and irradiated to the flow path of the gas mixture containing the nano-particles thereby activating the oxygen gas in the gas mixture to form surface modified nano-particles <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> covered at the surface with an oxide layer <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), by which nano-particles <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> surface modified to a state with no coalescence or agglomeration can be deposited as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and deposits not deteriorating the characteristic inherent to the nano-particles can be obtained. Thus, a nano-particle assembly capable of exhibiting the characteristic inherent to the nano-particles which are packed closest in the three dimensional manner and arranged regularly can be obtained. For the activation of the oxygen gas, the electron beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> irradiated from the electron beam irradiation device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> can also be used. In this case, since parts for introducing the excimer laser light <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are no more required, the apparatus can be reduced in the size and made simple and convenient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Then, a method of using an IR-ray radiation regarding the surface modification of the nano-particles in the gas stream is to be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. At first, the silicon nano-particles (grain size: 3 nm) formed, for example, by a rare gas atmosphere laser ablation method or a sputtering method and controlled to a single grain size in a grain size distribution, for example, by a differentiation type electrical mobility classification method enters together with the helium gas <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at a high purity (impurity concentration: 0.5 ppb or less), which is an atmospheric gas upon preparation and flowing at a predetermined mass flow rate (0.99 SLM) into the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In this case, the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is provided, for example, with the porous ceramic body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for introducing the oxygen gas from the oxygen gas reservoir <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> at a predetermined mass flow rate (0.01 SLM), and the IR-ray introduction window <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> for introducing the radiated IR-ray <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. While oxygen is referred to as an example of the gas species for surface modification, there is no particular restriction on the gas species but it may be nitrogen or hydrogen or an aerosol containing organic molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Then, nano-particles carried by the helium gas to the gas mixing chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are heated in a mixed gas atmosphere formed by mixing the oxygen gas and the helium gas introduced from the porous ceramic body <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, for example, up to 1000&deg; C. by the IR rays <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> irradiated by way of the IR-ray introduction window <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. By the heat treatment, the nano-particles are converted into surface modified nano-particles <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> covered at the surface with an oxide film <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) Then, the surface modified nano-particles <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> are collected/deposited by way of the nozzle <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> on the deposition substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The deposited nano-particles are in the state free of coalescence/agglomeration as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and deposits not deteriorating the characteristic inherent to the nano-particles can be obtained. Thus, a nano-particle assembly packed closest and arranged regularly in a three dimensional manner capable of providing the characteristic inherent to nano-particles can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As described above, by the method of suppressing the saturation of the deposition amount of the nano-particles by providing the step of neutralizing charges of the nano-particles charged to a single polarity in the gas stream before collection/deposition step, as well as a surface modifying method for nano-particles by providing a step of mixing the first gas species carrying the nano-particles and a second gas species for surface modification and a step of activating the second gas species for the gas mixture of the first gas species and the second gas species and the nano-particles carried on the gas mixture before the collection/deposition step, nano-particles in a charged state in the gas stream can be deposited efficiently, as well as surface modification for the nano-particles which are extremely sensitive to defects or impurities caused by large exposure ratio of the surface atoms can be conducted in a gas stream at a good controllability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments illustrated in the drawings, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein and also such modifications fall within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
