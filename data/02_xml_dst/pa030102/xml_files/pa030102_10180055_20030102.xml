<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a solar panel comprising solar cells affixed to one or more sheet elements and a frame for supporting said sheet elements, wherein the frame comprises one or more pretensioned strings for attaching said sheet elements to the frame, the sheet elements being attached to said strings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A reduction in solar cell mass can be achieved with a known process to make solar cells with a thin film process. According to this known process the solar cell material is manufactured in the form of thin-films, which comprise multiple layers of e.g. vapour-deposited material. These thin-films are relative delicate and can not be used as structural elements. Therefore, according to the prior art, these thin-films are attached to a backing material such as a sheet of metal or plastic foil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This backing material is, in order to provide sufficient constructional rigidity, relatively heavy. Especially for spacecraft applications such a heavy backing material should be avoided. Besides, usually the sheet or foil needs to be stressed to increase rigidity of the structure to a sufficient extent. At the interconnects between the cells, stresses will occur. These stresses between the solar cells may lead to difficulties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,293,731 describes a solar cell generator especially for spacecrafts, consisting of a rectangular frame design with solar cells bonded on a lightweight sheet. Tensioning elements are operatively interposed between the frame structure and the panel sheets. Herein the solar cells are bonded with a small gap between adjacent solar cells and means are interconnected to each other to collect the electrical current and to transfer this electrical current by wires to the spacecraft. Stay wires extend along lateral edges of the sheets. These wires are also secured to the tensioning means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The thin light-weight sheets of solar cells have certain maximum dimensions limited in the production process. As a result, the frame structure of the solar panel has to be dense, which leads to a high weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> EP 218 858 discloses a solar panel which comprises solar energy collectors. These collectors are composed of strip-formed mirrors that have solar cells on their back surfaces. The collectors are mounted on supporting strings that extend between two transverse beams of a central mast. Light impinges on the mirrors, which reflect it towards solar cells of adjacent collectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The risk of failure of this solar panel is relatively high. During launch, the solar panel is in a folded position. Once in orbit, the solar panels are unfolded, wherein the strings have to be unrolled. The unrolling of the strings involves a complex mechanism that does not comply with the high reliability standards of the space industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another solar panel assembly is known from EP 926 068. This solar panel assembly comprises rectangular panels each carrying solar cells. The panels are pivotally interconnected. Tensioning wires are used to bend the panels in order to increase the structural stiffness of the extended solar panel assembly. The tensioning wires may extend through openings in the panels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The tensioning wires are operated after unfolding the solar panel assembly from a folded position, which may lead to difficulties. Moreover, the solar cells are not thin film sheets. The panels are therefore not supported in a frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to provide a solar panel according to the introduction, wherein the structural characteristics thereof are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention that object is achieved in that the sheet elements are composed of flexible material and are attached to the strings in a corrugated shape </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to the invention it is possible that the sheet elements are provided with at least one row of apertures for weaving a string through successive apertures of said row. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> By means of the above-mentioned measures, it is achieved that instead of using a relatively heavy backing material, the sheet elements are attached to a frame for supporting the sheet elements by means of the mentioned pretensioned strings. Since the sheet elements are attached to these strings in a corrugated shape, in the sheet elements a certain amount of elastic bending energy will be stored. The bending lines which are present in the sheet elements provide rigidity for the sheet elements. The combination of using strings and bending the respective sheet elements is sufficient for creating the required rigidity of the solar panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Moreover, compared to a known solar panel wherein the solar cells are mounted on a separate pretensioned sheet, mounting solar cells on strings according to the invention strongly or fully reduces stresses between the solar cells at their interconnects, irrespective of pretensioning the strings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment the solar cells comprise an electrical conductive backing material, which forms said sheet elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment the solar cells comprise an electrical conductive backing material, which is mounted on said sheet elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> If the solar cells with their backing material are bonded to sheet elements, stresses may occur in the solar cell interconnects due to differences in thermal expansion of said solar cells with their backing material on the one hand and the material of said sheet elements on the other hand. Omitting a separate sheet element, i.e. said backing material serves as sheet elements, essentially eliminates such deviating thermal expansion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention it is possible that a series of successive sheet elements is attached to each string or each set of strings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to known techniques the dimensions of the individual sheet elements which can be manufactured by means of vapour-deposited materials are limited. In order to be able to provide the solar panel with a sufficient surface area, a series of individual sheet elements has to be provided. Respective sheet elements are attached to the strings in order that the sheet elements themselves abut to adjacent sheet elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention it is possible that elastic bending energy is stored in each of the sheet elements, wherein the sheet elements are attached to the strings in order to cause the tips of each of the sheet elements to be urged towards the tips of adjacent sheet elements as a result of the bending energy stored in each of the sheet elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Because of the fact that the respective elements are urged towards adjacent elements a contact area between said elements is created. This contact area provides the electrical contact between adjacent sheet elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative embodiment it is possible that the sheet panels are connected to adjacent sheet elements by means of electrical conductive adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the present invention it is preferred that each of the strings is provided with a stop element at respective ends of the string, in order to enclose the sheet elements attached to the string between said stop elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The stop elements are at least provided at the respective ends of the strings. The presence of the stop elements provide a very simple and cheap fixing means for fixing the respective bended sheet elements between two stop elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention it is possible that the stop element is composed of electrical conductive material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Such an electrical conductive stop element can be used in order to connect an electric wire in order to guide an electric current created in the solar panel into an electric circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the invention it is possible that the strings are composed of electrical non-conductive material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Because of this measure it is avoided that current may leak towards the structural frame of the solar panel. In other words, when the strings themselves are electrical nonconductive no current can be guided through the strings towards a frame part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that each of the strings is provided with at least one spring element at a respective end thereof in order to stretch the respective string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The spring element will be used in order to stretch respective strings which are present in the solar panel string. When the solar panel is used the strings in the solar panel may lengthen. This may reduce the pretension which is present in the strings. Because of the presence of the spring elements the tension in the strings can be maintained at a required level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect the invention relates to a solar panel assembly, comprising two or more solar panels according to the present invention. Moreover, the invention relates to a spacecraft which is provided with the solar panel according to the present invention.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 a</cross-reference> satellite <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is schematically drawn, being provided with an assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of solar panels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. Individual solar panels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are each connected to adjacent solar panels in order that the solar panel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be folded (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) or unfolded (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The solar panel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising the solar panels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is specifically adapted to be used in a spacecraft, since the solar panel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an advantageous light-weight construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 a</cross-reference> part of the solar panel <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is shown schematically. The outer frame has a rectangular shape. The outer frame consists of a first and a second bar, which run in essence parallel at a distance with respect to each other. These bars <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are connected by means of a transverse beam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The construction can be further completed by means of additional bars or beams <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The solar panel according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also comprises solar cells which are fixed to one or more sheet elements <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> only one sheet element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> having relatively large dimensions has been drawn. The sheet element itself is thin and rather fragile. The sheet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is attached to the frame-elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by means of a first <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a second <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> string. The sheet element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is in this case provided with two rows of apertures for weaving the respective strings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through the rows of apertures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The strings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are stretched by means of respective spring elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Because of the presence of these spring elements the strings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will be fixed in the frame element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a pretensioned state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The relatively flexible and thin sheet element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> will be urged in a corrugated form, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> when the string length of the string <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> passing through the first and end aperture of sheet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is reduced in length compared to the original flat length of sheet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. By forcing sheet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> into a buckled state a reactive tension inside the string <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> For reasons of simplicity in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> the corrugated shape of the sheet element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is exaggerated. In practice, the corrugated shape is a gentle undulation equal just beyond the buckled shape of the sheet element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The strings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are provided with respective stop elements <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, in order to avoid that the strings can be removed from the respective bars <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The method for attaching the sheet element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the strings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is more clearly indicated in the following drawings. The sheet element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may consist of a plurality of sheet elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Sheet element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be manufactured from a sheet built up of a thin film photovoltaic layer at an electrical conductive substrate, for example a metal as is disclosed in the publication &ldquo;Low Cost and Lightweight Amorphous Silicon Solar Array for Space Application&rdquo; in the proceedings of the 34th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference, SAE, Vancouver, August 1999. In the sheet according to the disclosure the photovoltaic layer may have a thickness of 3 &mgr;m and the substrate a thickness of 25 &mgr;m. The material of the substrate is for example a metal or a graphite. The strings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may have a core which is a weave of a synthetic material, wherein the outside layer of said strings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is an electrical non-conductive material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view indicating the bars <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and one string element, for example <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is affixed between respective bars. The string <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the end thereof is provided with the stop elements <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Between stop element <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and bar <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> a spring element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is present in order to pretension string <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> on the string <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> a plurality of sheet elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is attached. A sheet element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be a single thin-film solar cell with only a metal foil backing while the maximum dimensions of each sheet element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be limited to a practical size of the solar cells. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows sheet element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by way of an example in a single up and down wave, however, more waves are possible between the outer ends of sheet element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in order to create a substantial surface area, each string <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> should be connected to the mentioned plurality of sheet elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. At the string <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> two anvil blocks <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are attached. By means of these anvil blocks in respective sheet elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> a certain amount of elastic bending energy is stored. Therefore, the ends of the respective sheet elements are urged towards each other with a certain force. Due to this elastic bending force stored in the respective sheet elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> electrical contact between the successive sheet elements is assured. The contact area of two successive sheet elements is indicated schematically with reference number <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> indicate other embodiments for the specific electrical contact area between the adjacent sheets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such as structural bonding, welding, soldering and the mechanical connection by a plastic rivet with a hollow core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a first embodiment of a contact area between two adjacent sheet elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each of those sheet elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a substrate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with for instance a thickness of 25 &mgr;m. The material of the substrate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is for example a metal or graphite. On top of this substrate the solar cells <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are present. The electrical contact between the first and second sheet element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is assured only by mechanical forces stored inside the material of the sheets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> between a first and a second sheet element an electrical conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is present in order to enhance electrical contact between the adjacent sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> each of the sheet elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is affixed to the string <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by means of a non-conductive structural bond <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The presence of this bond <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will enhance the rigidity of the corrugated sheet elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8 a</cross-reference> first embodiment of an anvil block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shown. The anvil block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (also see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) is made of a conductive material. The anvil block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be connected to an electrical wire <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in order to guide a current towards an electrical circuit. Alternatively, according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the anvil block <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can be made of a non-conductive material.
