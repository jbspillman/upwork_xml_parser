<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a sound generating system and, more particularly, to a sound generating system for producing sound from vibrations in a musical instrument through a natural microphone simulation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A stringed instrument such as, for example an acoustic guitar is used for ensemble as well as solo. The solo or ensemble may be recorded through a microphone. While the acoustic guitar is being ensembled with other musical instruments, the acoustic guitar sound is gathered through the microphone together with the other sorts of sound, and the acoustic guitar sound and the other sorts of sound are converted to an electric signal, and are mixedly stored in a suitable recording medium. It is impossible to record only the acoustic guitar sound through the microphone during the ensemble. If the guitar sound is to be selectively recorded during the ensemble, the vibrations of strings are directly converted through a pickup unit, which is attached to the acoustic guitar to an electric signal. A piezoelectric converting element is preferable for the direct conversion from the mechanical vibrations to electric energy, because the electric signal from the piezoelectric pickup unit is easy processed for the volume control and feedback control. The electric signal is equalized and amplified through a suitable amplifier, and is supplied to a speaker system. The speaker system converts the electric signal to reproduced guitar sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Although the electric signal is directly converted from the vibrations of strings, the listener feels the reproduced guitar sound different from the acoustic guitar sound. The listener expresses the reproduced guitar sound as &ldquo;not so rich as the acoustic guitar sound&rdquo;. This is because of the fact that the electric signal merely represents the vibrations of the strings. In other words, the electric signal does not contain signal components representative of the reverberation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is proposed to process the electric signal for making the reproduced guitar sound approximate to the acoustic guitar sound. The prior art signal processing system simulates the reverberation in the resonator of the acoustic guitar as well as the sound directly produced from the vibrations of the plucked string. The sound directly produced from the vibrations of the plucked string is hereinbelow referred to as &ldquo;direct sound&rdquo;. The prior art signal processing system includes a signal processing unit assigned to the direct sound. The signal processing unit has a delay circuit, and produces an electric signal representative of the direct sound through the delay circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although the prior art signal processing system produces an audio signal representative of a reproduced sound with the reverberation, sharp dips periodically take place in the frequency characteristics of the audio signal so that a certain frequency band is unnaturally emphasized. The certain frequency band influences the timbre of the reproduced sound, and the listener feels the reproduced sound unnatural. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an important object of the present invention to provide a sound generating system, which produces sound approximate to acoustic sound of a predetermined acoustic musical instrument through a natural microphone simulation regardless of another sort of sound concurrently produced. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings, a sound generating system embodying the present invention largely comprises a pickup unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a signal receiving section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a sound generating section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The pickup unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is attached to an acoustic guitar <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and converts vibrations of strings <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to an electric signal Sa. In this instance, the pickup unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is of the type converting the vibrations to the electric signal Sa by means of a piezoelectric element, and is embedded in a bridge <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. While the strings <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are vibrating, the strings <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> repeatedly exert stress on the bridge <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and the bridge <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> transmits the stress to the piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is sensitive to the stress, and converts the stress to electric charge. Thus, the pickup unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> directly produces the electric signal Sa from the vibrations of the strings <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> so that other sorts of sound are never mixed into the electric signal Sa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The electric signal Sa is supplied from the pickup unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the signal receiving section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The signal receiving section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> preliminarily processes the electric signal Sa for the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and supplies an electric signal Si to the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> achieves two major jobs. The first job is to simulate at least reverberation generated by the resonator of the acoustic guitar <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and the second job is to simulate the direct sound produced from the vibratory strings <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may further simulate reflection-tones in a certain environment such as, for example, a hall. In detail, the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> produces reverberatory components representative of the reverberation from the electric signal Si, and adds delay components to the electric signal Si without changing the frequency characteristics of the electric signal Si for producing a composite electric signal. The composite electric signal is representative of the direct sound of the acoustic guitar. The signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> adds the reverberatory components to the composite electric signal so as to produce a quasi-acoustic signal So. The quasi-acoustic signal So is representative of sound approximate to the guitar sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The quasi-acoustic signal So is supplied from the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the sound generating section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The sound generating section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> produces an audio signal from the quasi-acoustic signal So, and converts the audio signal to quasi-guitar sound. Thus, the sound generating system according to the present invention simulates both of the reverberation and the direct sound so that the quasi-guitar sound is more analogous to the acoustic guitar sound than the sounds produced by the prior art sound generating system. Especially, the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> maintains the frequency characteristics of the composite electric signal similar to the electric signal Si so that the timbre of the quasi-guitar sound is approximate to that of the acoustic guitar. The audience feels the attack of the tones natural. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> carries out a digital signal processing on the electric signal Si. For this reason, the electric signal is converted between the digital form and analog form on both sides of the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The signal receiving section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and sound generating section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are hereinbelow described in detail. The signal receiving section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes an input circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is abbreviated as &ldquo;ADC&rdquo; in the drawings. The input circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives the electric signal Sa, and transfers the electric signal Sa to the analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The potential level is sampled in response to a clock signal at short intervals, and is converted to a corresponding binary value. Thus, the electric signal Sa is converted to a series of binary values, and the digital signal Si is supplied from the analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The sound generating section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a digital- to-analog converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a sound system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The digital-to-analog converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is abbreviated as &ldquo;DAC&rdquo; in the drawings. As described hereinbefore, the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> simulates the reverberation and the direct sound, and produces the quasi-acoustic signal So in the form of digital codes. The signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> supplies the digital quasi-acoustic signal So to the digital-to-analog converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the digital-to-analog converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> produces the audio signal Ss from the digital quasi- acoustic signal So through the digital-to-analog conversion. The sound system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes suitable amplifiers and speakers. The audio signal Ss is amplified and equalized by the amplifiers, and, thereafter, the quasi-guitar sound is produced from the audio signal Ss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the case where the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> simulates the reflection-tones, it is desirable that the signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> separates the digital quasi-acoustic signal So into a left-channel signal and a right-channel signal for stereophonic sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The signal processing section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is abbreviated as &ldquo;DSP&rdquo; in the drawings. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> controls the other system components, and includes a central processing unit, i.e., CPU <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a program memory <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a working memory <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the program memory <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and working memory <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are implemented by a read only memory, i.e., ROM and a random access memory, i.e., RAM. Parameters and coefficients are also stored in the read only memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> achieves several jobs, and realizes several functions corresponding to a harmonic series simulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a reverberation simulator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a direct sound simulator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a mixer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and an equalizer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. These functions or the component sections <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are realized through several sorts of digital signal processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> firstly simulates a harmonic series to be added to the tone represented by the electric signal Sa. For this reason, the digital signal Si is firstly supplied from the analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the digital harmonic series simulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Although the piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> convert the strength of plucking/picking on the strings <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the amplitude of the electric signals Sa, the audience recognizes the strength of plucking/picking as variation of harmonic series under the condition that the amplitude in the attack exceeds a certain level. The harmonic series simulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> aims at imparting signal components representative of the harmonic series varied depending upon the amplitude of the electric signals S to the digital signal Si. In order to vary the harmonic series, the digital signal is processed as if the electric signal Sa passes through a circuit which softly clips the electric signal Sa for increasing the harmonics together with the amplitude of the electric signal Sa. When the electric signal Sa is output from the circuit, the distortion is increased in the electric signal Sa depending upon the amplitude. The function of the circuit is realized by the harmonic series simulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> converts the input digital signal Si to output digital signal Sh by using an input-and-output conversion table or through calculations on certain arithmetic equations. An example of the conversion is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application laid-open No. 5-127672. Upon completion of the digital signal processing, the digital signal Sh contains the signal component representative of the harmonic series. By virtue of the harmonic series represented by the signal component, the audience feels the attack of the quasi-guitar tones natural. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the digital signal Sh is subjected to two sorts of data processing as if the digital signal Sh is supplied in parallel to the reverberation simulator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the direct sound simulator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The reverberation simulator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> adds signal components representative of the reverberation to the digital signal Sh, and equalizes the resultant digital signal. Namely, the reverberation simulator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a signal component generator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A and an equalizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B. The equalizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B is abbreviated as &ldquo;EQ&rdquo; in the drawings. The signal component generator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A stands for the simulation of the reverberation. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> simulates the reverberation generated through the resonator of the acoustic guitar <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the reflection-tones through the digital signal processing, and adds signal components representative of the reverberation and reflection-tones to the digital signal Sh. The reflection-tones are like tones recorded in a room through a microphone spaced from an acoustic guitar. The digital signal processing for the signal components is equivalent to the function achieved through a comb-type filter circuit. The function for the reverberation and the circuit configuration of the comb-type filter circuit are well known to persons skilled in the art, and no further description is incorporated hereinbelow. When the reverberation is simulated, the delay time in the comb-like filter circuit is to be short, i.e., not longer than 20 milliseconds so that the reverberation is as rich as the reverberation generated through the resonator of the acoustic guitar. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> corrects the digital signals through the digital signal processing corresponding to the function of the equalizer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B so as to make the timbre of the quasi- guitar sound analogous to the timbre of the acoustic guitar sound. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> eliminates a signal component representative of high-frequency components from the digital signal. Although the short reverberation tends to vary the timbre of the quasi-guitar sound, the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> corrects the signal component for preventing the quasi- guitar sound from change of timbre. As a result, when the digital signal is converted through the audio signal to the quasi-guitar sound, the audience feels the quasi- guitar sound as if they hear sound generated in woody instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The digital signal processing for the direct sound simulation is corresponding to the function of an all-pass filter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and the function of an equalizer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B. The all-pass filter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and the equalizer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B are abbreviated as &ldquo;APF&rdquo; and &ldquo;EQ&rdquo;, respectively. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> simulates the direct sound radiated from the strings <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through the function of the all-pass filter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A. Although the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> adds a delay component to the digital signal, the timbre of the quasi- guitar sound still has the timbre analogous to the acoustic guitar. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> makes the attack of the quasi-guitar sound analogous to that of the acoustic guitar sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As described hereinbefore, guitar sound reproduced from an electric signal converted through a microphone is different from guitar sound reproduced from an electric signal converted through a piezoelectric element in the harmonic series of the attack portion. The difference results in that the former is richer than the latter. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> imparts a signal component supplementing the difference to the digital signal Sh through the function of the all-pass filter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The all-pass filter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A is equivalent to the combination of a loop of a delay circuit DL, multipliers AT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/AT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/AT<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and adders AD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/AD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The delay circuit DL, multipliers AT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/AT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/AT<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and adders AD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/AD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a whole constitute a Schroeder all-pass filter. The delay circuit DL introduces delay time r into the signal propagation therethrough, and the impulse response h(t) is expressed by equation 1, and the time-response characteristics are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> processes the digital signal Sh through the function of the all-pass filter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A, in which the delay time r is short so that the signal component representative of short delay is added to the digital signal without varying the frequency characteristics. This results in that the quasi-guitar tones have the attacks analogous to those of the acoustic guitar tones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The digital signal, to which the signal component representative of the delay has been already supplemented, is subjected to the equalization for preventing the quasi-guitar sound from undesirable change in timbre. Namely, the digital signal is supplied from the all-pass filter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A to the equalizer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The digital signal Sb thus equalized is mixed with the digital signal Sr as if analog signals corresponding to the digital signals Sr/Sb are supplied to the mixer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The mixing ratio has been given to the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Finally, the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> corrects the signal components representative of the frequency spectrum for making the quasi-guitar sound approximate to the acoustic guitar sound. The function of the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is same as the equalizer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Thus, the digital quasi-acoustic signal So is output from the equalizer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and is supplied to the sound generating section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated from the foregoing description, the sound generating system according to the present invention processes the electric signal representative of the vibrations generated in a musical instrument so as to add the signal components representative of the reverberation/reflection-tones and the signal components representative of natural attack of the musical instrument to the received electric signal. When sound is reproduced from the electric signal, the audience feels the sound approximate to the original sound generated from the musical instrument. In the sound generating system, the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> processes the electric signal through the function of the reverberation simulator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the function of the direct sound simulator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in parallel. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> simulates the reverberation generated through the resonator of the musical instrument <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the reflection-tones in a certain room through the function of the reverberation simulator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and produces the signal components representative of the reverberation and the reflection-tones. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> further simulates the attack of the original tones, and produces the signal components representative of the attack. The digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> adds both signal components to the electric signal, and the sound is produced from the electric signal. This results in the sound approximate to the original sound. Especially, the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> introduces the signal components representative of the short delay into the electric signal through the function of the all-pass filter so that the frequency spectrum is not widely varied. Thus, the sound generating system produces the sound approximate to the original sound as if the original sound is converted to the electric signal through a microphone. Moreover, the digital signal processor adds the signal component representative of a harmonic series to the electric signal through the function of the harmonic series simulator before the digital processing through the functions of the reverberation/direct sound simulators. The signal components representative of the harmonic series further makes the attack of the sound natural. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An acoustic guitar generates the acoustic tones which contain not only the harmonics but also non-harmonic components. The non-harmonic components feature the guitar sound as well as the harmonics do. However, when the vibrations of strings are converted through the piezoelectric element to the analog signal Sa, the electric signal Sa does not contain a signal component representative of the non-harmonic components, and has a frequency spectrum different from that of the acoustic guitar tones. Audience feels the sound produced directly from the electric signal &ldquo;inorganic&rdquo;. The spectrum of the acoustic guitar sound is restored through the all-pass filter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A. In other words, the when the low-frequency component is emphasized, the quasi-guitar tones become close to the sound resonated in woody resonator. On the other hand, when the high-frequency components are emphasized, the audience feels the quasi-guitar sound metallic. Thus, the sound generating system according to the present invention modifies the spectrum through the digital signal processing so as to make the quasi-guitar tones close to the acoustic guitar tones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Although the particular embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> For example, the pickup unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be implemented by another sort of vibration detecting elements such as, for example, photo-sensors or magnetic sensors. Photo-couplers may be used as the photo-sensors, and electromagnetic pickups are examples of the magnetic sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The sound generating system may be associated with another sort of stringed instrument, a percussion instrument and a keyboard musical instrument. </paragraph>
