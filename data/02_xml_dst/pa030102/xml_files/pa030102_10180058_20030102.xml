<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus and a mobile radiotelephone connecting system, and more particularly to a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus which has a low-power radio communication function for performing radio communication with low power or an optical communication function for performing communication using light and a connecting function to a network such as a LAN (Local Area Network) and is used in combination with a mobile radiotelephone set having the low-power radio communication function or the optical communication function to realize mobile radiotelephone conversation using a network such as a LAN and a mobile radiotelephone connecting system which includes a plurality of groups each including a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus and a mobile radiotelephone set and uses a network such as a LAN as a path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a technique has been proposed which uses a low-power radio communication function or an optical communication function provided for a mobile radiotelephone set to establish a connection to a fixed circuit-telephone line. This is intended to utilize a less expensive circuit such as a fixed circuit telephone line while maintaining environments of use such that a telephone call can be originated at any place by making use of an address list in which mobile radiotelephone sets are registered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, in companies or the like, use of a mobile radio type private telephone set such as a PHS (Personal Handyphone System) as a local telephone set has been and is increasing. However, in order to utilize a PHS, local equipment for exclusive use for the PHS is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as a conventional connecting method for such a fixed circuit telephone line as described above, a proposal has been made wherein the Bluetooth is used to establish a connection to a fixed circuit telephone line (by Ericsson and so forth). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, such a local telephone set as described above is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 289339/1996 entitled &ldquo;Local Telephone Service Providing Method and Apparatus&rdquo; or Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 009334/1997 entitled &ldquo;Exchange Apparatus for the PHS&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional techniques described above have the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> If it is intended to realize local telephone conversation with a special telephone set (mobile radiotelephone set) such as a PHS using a LAN (Local Area Network) without using PHS local telephone equipment, then a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus to the LAN must be able to operate immediately. In other words, communication through the LAN must always be kept established. The reason is that, while it is required, in an application of a telephone set, that telephone conversation can be performed immediately after a telephone call is originated, if a connection to the LAN is established after a telephone call is originated, then the time for validation such as connection authentication deteriorates the convenience. Not only when a connection is established to a destination mobile radiotelephone set through the LAN and a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus, but also when a telephone call is originated from another mobile radiotelephone set through the LAN, the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus must always be prepared for utilization. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus may be configured such that it further comprises a base table for storing, when a mobile radiotelephone set connected to the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus in the initial state moves and is connected to another mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus, a corresponding relationship between the identifier of the radiotelephone set having moved and the identifier of the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus connected at the location after the movement, discrimination means for discriminating, when the line open request is received, whether or not the identifier of a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus corresponding to the identifier of the mobile radiotelephone set having originated the telephone call is stored in the base table, replying means for issuing, if the identifier of the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus corresponding to the identifier of the mobile radiotelephone set having originated the telephone call is stored in the base table, a negative acknowledge including the identifier of the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus to the line open request, and third search means for searching, when the negative acknowledge to the line open request is received, for a network address corresponding to the identifier of the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus included in the negative acknowledge from within the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus address table, and the transmission means transmits a line open request including the identifier of the mobile ratio telephone set having originated the telephone call to a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus of the searched out network address corresponding to the identifier of the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus included in the negative acknowledge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mobile radiotelephone connecting system, comprising a plurality of mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus, and a location reference server including a dynamic location table for storing a corresponding relationship between identifiers of mobile radiotelephone sets and identifiers of those of the mobile radiotelephone communicating apparatus with which the mobile radiotelephone sets can currently communicate, each of the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus including first communication means for performing first communication with a mobile radiotelephone set by low-power radio communication or optical communication, second communication means for performing second communication with a second mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus through a network, relaying means for relaying the first communication by the first communication means and the second communication by the second communication means, a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus address table for storing network addresses of the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus, first search means for communicating, when a telephone call is originated from a first one of the mobile radiotelephone sets to second one of the mobile radiotelephone sets, with the location reference server to search for an identifier of a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus corresponding to an identifier of the second mobile radiotelephone set from within the dynamic location table, second search means for searching for the network address corresponding to the searched out identifier of the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus from within the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus address table, and transmission means for transmitting a line open request including the identifier of the mobile radiotelephone set having originated the telephone call to the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus of the search out network address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus and the mobile radiotelephone connecting system, the following advantages are achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (1) Although use of a local mobile radiotelephone set different from a public mobile radiotelephone set to use of which a user is familiar gives rise to a failure to make the most of functions of the local mobile radiotelephone set to use of which the user is not familiar or, for example, due to addition of novel functions incorporated in a local mobile radiotelephone set, a local mobile radiotelephone set of an old model cannot use the latest functions incorporated in another local mobile radiotelephone set of a novel type placed on the market after several years, with the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus and the mobile radiotelephone connecting system according to the present invention, since a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus is provided, not only when a network is used to originate a telephone call, but also when a public mobile radio circuit is used to originate a telephone call, the same mobile radiotelephone set can be used and the necessity for skilled operation in use of two telephone sets and movement of data between two telephone sets can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> (2) If a method wherein an interface for performing low-power radio communication or optical communication and another interface for establishing a connection to a network are incorporated in a computer and a local mobile radiotelephone system is implemented using software, each time the operating system (OS) of the computer changes, the setting for data communication changes. Further, since the MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) is not necessarily long with the OS of the computer, communication is sometimes disabled. However, with the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus and the mobile radiotelephone connecting system according to the present invention, a local mobile radiotelephone system which is stable without being influenced by a change of the OS of a computer can be implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> (3) Where a computer is used to implement a local mobile radiotelephone system with software as described in paragraph (2) above, several minutes are required to start up the OS of the computer, and time is required also for connection to a network. Therefore, the time for which a telephone set can use is limited. However, with the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus and the mobile radiotelephone connecting system according to the present invention, thanks to a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus, a local mobile ratio telephone set which can be used at any time can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> (4) Since the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus is an apparatus having necessary but minimum functions, little problem occurs even where the power supply to it is normally kept on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> (5) Since the location of a mobile radiotelephone set is recorded in both of the location reference server and the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus, even if, for example, the location reference server fails, it is possible to grasp where the mobile radiotelephone set is located using the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus without using the location reference server to establish a connection of the mobile radiotelephone set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> (6) Where a mobile radiotelephone set and a mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus have a communication function, for example, in accordance with the Bluetooth as a low-power radio communication function, since the radio wave range is short, the range of a mobile radiotelephone set within which the radio wave can be relayed by the mobile radiotelephone connecting apparatus is small. Consequently, the location of the mobile radiotelephone set can be specified to a range of several meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like parts or elements are denoted by like reference symbols.</paragraph>
