<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical fiber and an apparatus thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of sintering a silica-based glass porous body (silica-based glass soot body) of an optical fiber preform used for forming an optical fiber, and a sintering apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A variety types of optical fibers are known and used, but, a silica-based glass single mode optical fiber (SMF) will be described as an example. The SMF includes a core having a diameter of 10 &mgr;m and a cladding layer formed on the core and having a diameter of 125 &mgr;m. A refractive index of the core is higher than that of the cladding layer. An example of a method of producing the SMF will be briefly described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Steps 1 to 3: Formations of Glass Rod of Core Portion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Step 1: A silica-based glass porous soot body is synthesized on a seed rod by, for example, a vapor-phase axial deposition (VAD) method or an outside vapor-phase deposition (OVD) method. The porous soot body will be formed as the core of the SMF. In the step (process), a dopant for increasing the refractive index of the core, for example, Ge will be doped, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Step 2: The synthesized porous soot body is introduced into a sintering furnace, and dehydrated and sintered (solidified or vitrified) therein to form a transparent glass preform for the core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Step 3: The resultant transparent glass core preform is elongated to form an elongated glass rod for the core. Such the elongation can be performed in a heating condition by using a flame of combustion, plasma flame or an electric furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Step 4 to 5: Formation of Cladding Portion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Step 4: A porous soot body is synthesized on a periphery of the elongated glass core rod by, for example, the OVD method. The synthesized porous soot body will be formed as the cladding layer of the SMF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Step 5: The resultant optical fiber soot preform comprising the elongated glass core rod and the porous soot cladding body synthesized on the glass core rod, is introduced into the sintering furnace, and dehydrated and sintered the porous soot cladding body. As a result, an optical fiber preform comprising the elongated glass core rod and the glass cladding portion is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Steps 6 to 7: Formation of Optical Fiber </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Step 6: The resultant optical fiber preform is introduced into a drawing furnace, heated therein to melt and drawn out the melt preform from the drawing furnace to result in the SMF comprising the core having a diameter of 10 &mgr;m and the cladding layer formed on the periphery of the core and having a diameter of 125 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Step 7: A protective resin is coated on the periphery of the cladding layer to produce the final product of the SMF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, for producing the transparent core glass rod in steps 1 to 2, such the transparent core glass rod can be directly produced by a modified CVD method or a plasm method. In this method, the dehydrating and sintering processes are not necessary. The processes thereafter can be applied as same as the above processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To improve the productivity of the optical fiber, for example, the optical fiber preform used for producing the optical fiber becomes large in size. For example, the optical fiber preform having a length of 2,400 mm or more, a diameter 250 mm or more and a weight 40 kg or more may be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Inventors of the present patent application found disadvantages in the process of step 5 which will be occurred when producing a large sized optical fiber perform, but were not be occurred when producing a small-sized optical fiber preform. Such the disadvantages will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> non-sintered portion US may be remained in the cladding porous soot body SN formed on the periphery of the sintered glass core rod CT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B, a</cross-reference> diameter of the sintered upper portion Y may be smaller than that of the sintered lower portion X. Such a difference of the diameters of the upper portion Y and the lower portion X is larger than a predetermined value, for example, 10 mm, then the optical fiber having desired characteristics can not be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also, the sintered optical fiber may be fallen away from the supporting rod SR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The optical fiber preform used for the single mode optical fiber (SMF) was discussed, but such the disadvantages may be occurred in other optical fiber preforms used for other types of optical fibers, having a porous soot body to be sintered. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a method of sintering an optical fiber preform which is used for producing an optical fiber, and has desired characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a sintering apparatus used for the above sintering method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present patent application investigated reasons of the occurrence of the above disadvantages and found those reasons described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is considered that the occurrence of the disadvantage that the non-sintered portion US is remained in the porous soot body SN to be sintered, described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, is based on the reason that the sintering starts from a surface of the porous soot body SN, since an electric heater for sintering the porous soot body SN is arranged at an outside of a furnace tube and the porous soot body SN is heated by heat radiated by the furnace tube. Further, it is considered that the occurrence of the disadvantage is based on the reason that He gas, Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas and/or impurity are taken in the inner portion of the porous soot body at which the surface is sintered (solidified). Namely, it is considered that such the gases taken in the inner portion disturb the sintering of the inner portion of the porous soot body SN, and the non-sintered portion UN is remained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is considered that the occurrence of the disadvantage of the occurrence of the difference in the longitudinal direction of the optical fiber preform, described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, is based on the reason that the sintering upper portion Y is melting and the tensile strength thereof falls, then the sintering upper portion Y is stretched by the weight of the sintered lower portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is also considered that the occurrence of the disadvantage that the optical fiber preform is fallen away from the support rod SR, is based on the reason that the support rod SR having a small diameter such as 30 mm is melt or soften during sintering the upper portion Y or the upper end of the optical fiber preform, and the melting or soften support rod SR can not support the optical fiber preform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is noticed that the above disadvantages are occurred when the optical fiber preform becomes large in size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present patent application had attempted a variety of experiments under the above knowledges, for overcoming the above disadvantages, and found the key technology: in response to a position of an optical fiber preform to be sintered, (a) changing sintering temperature, (b) changing a relative moving sped between the optical fiber preform and a sintering zone in a sintering furnace, and (c) changing a quantity of gas (gases) for supplying the optical fiber preform to the sintering zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of producing an optical fiber preform including the step of dehydrating and sintering a porous soot body of the optical fiber preform in a state where the optical fiber preform is suspended, the sintering being carried out by varying at least one of a sintering temperature of the porous soot body, a relative moving speed between a sintering position of the porous soot body and a sintering zone, and a flow of gas supplied to the sintering zone, in response to a position of the optical fiber preform positioned to the sintering zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The dehydrating process and the sintering process can be simultaneously performed in a same sintering apparatus or independently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The sintering temperature of the porous soot body may be controlled in response to the position of the optical fiber preform positioned to the sintering zone under the following condition, when a predetermined flow of the gas is supplied to the sintering zone and at a predetermined relative speed between the optical fiber preform and the sintering zone, </paragraph>
