<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a multi-beam scanning optical system and an image forming apparatus using the same and, more particularly, to a multi-beam scanning optical system preferably used for an image forming apparatus such as a laser beam printer and a digital copying machine, which can perform high-speed and high-quality printing with a relatively simple structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a scanning optical system, which is used in an image forming apparatus such as a laser beam printer and a digital copying machine, guides light beams emitted from a light source to deflection means by incident optical means and images the light beams deflected by the deflection means in a spot shape on a photosensitive drum surface, which is a surface to be scanned, thereby optically scanning the photosensitive drum surface with the light beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, there is a growing demand for the image forming apparatus with higher speed as the image forming apparatus realizes higher performance and higher functionality. In order to meet such a demand, use of a plurality of light sources has been examined. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 9-54263 proposes a multi-beam scanning optical system having a multi-beam laser chip, which emits aligned plurality of laser beams from one chip, as a light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In such a multi-beam scanning optical system, synchronization detection optical means (BD optical system) is generally provided immediately before a position where an image signal is written in order to accurately control a writing position of an image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a main part sectional view in a main scanning direction (main scanning sectional view) of a conventional multi-beam scanning optical system. In the figure, reference numeral <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> denotes a light source unit, which has, for example, two light-emitting portions (light sources) consisting of a semiconductor laser. The two light-emitting portions are spaced apart from each other in a main scanning direction and a sub scanning direction. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> denotes an aperture stop, which forms light beams emitted from each light-emitting portion in a desired optimal beam shape. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> denotes a collimator lens, which converts the light beams that have passed through the aperture stop <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> into substantially parallel light beams. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> denotes a cylindrical lens, which has a predetermined refracting power only in the sub scanning direction. Note that each of the aperture stop <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the collimator lens <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the like constitutes an element of incident optical means <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> denotes deflection means, which consists of, for example, a rotary polygon mirror and is rotated in an arrow A direction in the figure at a constant speed by driving means (not shown) such as a motor. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> denotes scanning optical means having an f&thgr; characteristic, which has two lenses, first and second f&thgr; lenses. The scanning optical means <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> establishes an optically conjugate relationship between the vicinity of a deflection surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a light deflector <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the vicinity of a photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> as a surface to be scanned within a sub scanning cross section, thereby realizing a toppling correcting function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> denotes a return mirror (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BD mirror&rdquo;), which reflects a plurality of synchronization signal detection light beams (&ldquo;BD light beams&rdquo;) for adjusting timing at a scanning start position on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> toward a synchronization detection element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> discussed below. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> denotes a slit (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BD slit&rdquo;), which is disposed in a position equivalent to the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> denotes a BD conjugate lens, which is for establishing a conjugate relationship between the BD mirror <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the synchronization detection element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and corrects surface toppling of the BD mirror <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> denotes an optical sensor (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BD sensor&rdquo;) as the synchronization detection element. Note that each of the return mirror <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the BD slit <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, the BD conjugate lens <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the BD sensor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the like constitutes an element of the synchronization detection optical means (BD optical system). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the figure, BD detection is performed for each BD light beam, and the timing at a scanning start position of image recording on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is adjusted for each BD light beam using an output from the BD sensor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in the multi-beam scanning optical system with a plurality of light-emitting portions (light sources), an image to be printed is deteriorated if a relative writing position deviates for each of the light-emitting portions due to various reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-235154 describes that it is a problem that a width of each light beam corresponding to each light-emitting portion is changed by the deflection means and, as a result, a difference in outputs of the BD sensor occurs to deviate a writing position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, a relative writing position may deviate even in a state in which a difference in outputs of the BD sensor corresponding to each light-emitting portion does not occur as described above. For example, a relative writing position deviates even in a case where a focus of the main scanning cross section of the BD light beams is out of position on the BD slit surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a multi-beam scanning optical system and an image forming apparatus using the same that can realize high-speed and high-quality printing by a relatively simple structure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> First, technical means for attaining the object of the present invention will be hereinafter described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Note that, in order to prevent the figures from becoming unclear, a BD sensor that is otherwise shown on the upper side of the figures is not shown in all of the above-described figures. Also, a marginal light beam is not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 18A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference> shows a state of each instance when each light beam (here, A and B lights) is condensed precisely on one end (right end in the figure) of a BD slit with respect to a main scanning direction. The A light scanned from the left to the right in the figure is incident on the BD sensor for the first time when it reaches precisely the right end of the BD slit. At this point, the BD sensor outputs a signal informing that the A light is incident thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, the B light scanned from the left to the right is incident on the BD sensor for the first time when it reaches precisely the right end of the BD slit in the same manner as the A light. At this point, the BD sensor outputs a signal informing that the B light is incident thereon. Timing of these two signals is detected, whereby the timing at writing positions of the A and B lights is adjusted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference> shows writing positions at the time when a relationship of each light is in the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference>. The writing positions of the A and B lights are uniform in this state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> However, when the position of the focus of the A and B lights that have passed through an optical element, which condenses each light beam on a BD slit in a main scanning cross section (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BD condensing element&rdquo;), relatively deviates to the front side, that is, deflection means side by &dgr;M as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A, a</cross-reference> phenomenon discussed below occurs and the writing positions of the A and B lights deviate. The A light, which otherwise is in such timing that it is condensed at the right end of the BD slit and gradually starts to be incident on the BD sensor, has already been incident on the BD sensor due to the focus deviation (a broken line on the left side in the figure). The A light actually starts to be incident on the BD sensor when it is in a position shown by a solid line on the left side in the figure. The writing timing of the A light is earlier by an amount of deviation between the broken line and the solid line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Conversely, the B light, which is otherwise starts to be incident on the BD sensor when it is in a position of a broken line on the right side, cannot be incident due to the focus deviation until it reaches a position of a solid line on the right side. Thus, the writing start timing of the B light is delayed by the amount of deviation between the broken line on the right side and the solid line on the right side. Consequently, the relative writing positions of the A and B lights deviate according to a distance between the two broken lines on the BD slit surface as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the position of the focus of the A and B lights relatively deviates to the inner side, that is, the opposite side of the deflection means by &dgr;M as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>A, the two broken lines are spaced apart on the BD slit surface in the same manner as described above. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>B, the relative writing positions deviate according to a distance between the two broken lines. This case is different from the above-mentioned case in that the relationship of the writing positions of the A and B lights is opposite in the main scanning direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The relative writing positions deviate by the distance between the broken lines on the slit surface of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference> if a part of the scanning optical means is used as the BD condensing element as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. However, if the scanning optical means and the BD condensing element are optically independent from each other, an amount of relative deviation of an actual writing position involves not only the above-mentioned distance between the broken lines but also a focal length in the main scanning direction of the scanning optical means and a focal length in the main scanning direction of the BD condensing element. When the above-mentioned two focal lengths are different, a lateral magnification by the incident optical means and the scanning optical means and a lateral magnification by the incident optical means and the BD condensing element are different. In addition, a ratio of the two lateral magnifications depends on the focal length of the scanning optical means and the focal length of the BD condensing element. Strictly speaking, the ratio of the focal lengths and the ratio of the lateral magnifications are different if the incident optical means is not a parallel system. However, since the incident optical means is not generally an extreme convergent or divergent system, the ratio of the focal lengths and the ratio of the lateral magnifications can be treated as identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In addition, the focal length in the main scanning direction of the BD condensing element is often shorter than the focal length in the main scanning direction of the scanning optical means. This is because, if the focal length in the main scanning direction of the BD condensing element is made equal to or longer than that of the scanning optical means, the BD condensing element cannot be disposed spatially or an additional mirror is required for folding an optical path. Consequently, the distance between the broken lines on the BD slit surface is enlarged according to the ratio of the focal length of the scanning optical means to the focal length of the BD condensing element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Note that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the shorter the focal length of the BD condensing element becomes, more likely a difference of incident angles of the A and B lights occurs when the lights are incident on the BD slit. This difference of angles is substantially in inverse proportion to the focal length of the BD condensing element. Consequently, the distance between the broken lines on the BD slit surface becomes larger in proportion to a reciprocal of the focal length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> When the above-mentioned two phenomena are taken into account, even if the amount of deviation of a focus position within the main scanning cross section viewed from the BD slit surface is the same, the writing positions deviate by a square of the ratio of the focal length in the case where the scanning optical means and the BD condensing element are optically independent from each other compared with the case where a part of the scanning optical means is used as the BD condensing element. Thus, it becomes necessary to strictly control the deviation of a focus position within the main scanning cross section viewed from the BD slit surface. However, since strict control of a tolerance tends to deteriorate yield, it is preferable to avoid it as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned phenomena are attributable to the fact that the A and B lights are incident on the BD slit surface at different angles. Assuming that the incident angles are identical, a relative writing position does not deviate even if the focus deviates, although an overall writing position does. This does not lead to significant deterioration of a printing quality. In addition, this phenomenon of causing a difference in incident angle is attributable to the fact that a position of each light incident on the BD condensing element deviates when each light is guided to the BD sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> For example, if the BD condensing element is a lens, lights incident on the vicinity of a light axis of an optical element do not substantially change their angle after emission as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. However, travelling directions of lights incident on an end of the lens are bent according to a refracting power of the lens. If the BD condensing element is a mirror, the same phenomenon occurs. If light sources are spaced apart from each other in the main scanning direction, an incident position of each light on the BD condensing element always deviates unless an aperture stop is provided on a deflection surface. Thus, when lights are condensed on the BD slit surface, the lights are incident thereon at different angles. As a result, when the focus deviates, the timing of each light incident on the BD sensor deviates according to an incident angle on the BD slit, resulting in relative deviation of a writing position. This phenomenon always occurs as long as a deflection point of each light beam deviates in the main scanning direction whether the light source is a monolithic light source having a plurality of light-emitting portions, a plurality of independent light sources are arranged adjacent with each other, or light beams are turned into a multi-beam using light beam compositing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As a method of preventing such a phenomenon, a method of placing an aperture stop between the deflection means and the BD slit (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BD stop&rdquo;) is possible. When this method is used, it becomes possible to forcibly arrange a position, where each light beam is incident on the BD condensing element as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, to be uniform, and an angle of each light beam incident on the BD slit becomes uniform. As a result, even if the focus deviates, since all the light beams causes the writing positions to deviate by the same degree, relative deviation of a writing position does not occur and deterioration of a printed image can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In order to sufficiently obtain the above-mentioned effects, at least widths in the main scanning direction of all the light beams is required to be determined by the BD stop at each instance when each light beam starts to be incident on the BD sensor. In this case, main light positions in the main scanning direction of all the lights become identical (overlapped) after passing through the BD stop. If widths of some light beams are not determined by the BD stop, since only these light beams are incident on the BD condensing lens in a different position, a position of a main light deviates. Thus, if the focus deviates, writing positions corresponding to these light beams relatively deviate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The relative deviation of a writing position due to focus deviation viewed from the BD slit can be reduced by providing the BD stop in the synchronization detection optical means. However, if the focus position of the light beams condensed by the scanning optical means viewed from the surface to be scanned deviates in this case, the relative positional relationship of the A and B lights in the main scanning direction deviates compared with an ideal case (such a phenomenon is hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;deviation of a dot position&rdquo;), and the effects of the above-mentioned measures are reduced by half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A cause of the above-mentioned phenomenon is that the A and B lights are apart from each other in the main scanning direction on the deflection surface. Given that the distance in the main scanning direction of the light-emitting point is w, the focal length in the main scanning direction of the incident optical means is fn, and the distance from the aperture stop to the deflection point is d, the distance between the A and B lights p can be represented as follows (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>p&equals;d&middot;w/fn </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Then, given that the position of the focus viewed from the surface to be scanned is x and the focal length of the scanning optical means is fs, an amount of deviation of a dot position J is represented as follows if it is assumed to be zero in the ideal case (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>J&equals;p&middot;x/fs</italic></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>d&middot;w/fn</italic></highlight>)&middot;(<highlight><italic>x/fs</italic></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Thus, a sensitivity of relative deviation of a position J/x with respect to an amount of focus deviation x is represented as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>J/x</italic></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>d&middot;w</italic></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>fn&middot;fs</italic></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> With the examination hitherto conducted, it has been found that a printed image is given incongruity when the deviation of a dot position occurs at least in about half a dot. Given that a resolution is 1200 dpi, the relative deviation of a position is required to be controlled to 10 &mgr;m or less. In addition, the amount of focus deviation x viewed from the surface to be scanned is required to be allowed for approximately 3 mm taking into account a surface accuracy and an assembly accuracy of the scanning optical means. Thus, the sensitivity of the relative deviation of a position J/x with respect to the amount of focus deviation x is required to be as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>J/x</italic></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>d&middot;w</italic></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>fn&middot;fs</italic></highlight>)&lE;0.003&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> More preferably, it is desired to be as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>d&middot;w</italic></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>fn&middot;fs</italic></highlight>)&lE;0.0018&emsp;&emsp;(1&prime;) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> There is only one way of reducing the distance w in the main scanning direction of the light-emitting point and the distance d from the aperture stop to the deflection point to zero in order to meet the above conditional expression (1). It is to arrange the light-emitting portions in a state in which each light-emitting portion does not deviate in the main scanning direction, that is, align the light-emitting portions in the sub scanning direction, or to arrange the aperture stop or the conjugate point of the aperture stop on the deflection surface, thereby causing the main light of each light beam to cross on the deflection surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Concerning the former case, usually, when each light-emitting portion is arranged in this way, in particular, if the sub scanning direction is constituted in a magnification system, the distance between the light-emitting portions becomes too short as much as about several um to ten and several &mgr;m (a distance between light-emitting portions of a commercially available multi-laser is in the order of 100 &mgr;m), crosstalk occurs and an amount of light differs in each light-emitting portion. Thus, oscillation is not stable any more and a life of the light-emitting portions tends to be short. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Concerning the latter case, in order to arrange the aperture stop on the deflection surface, a desired state can be realized by giving the deflection surface a function as the aperture stop without providing anything equivalent to the aperture stop at least in the main scanning direction. However, this is not preferable because the width of the light beams to be deflected changes as the deflective scanning is performed and, thus, a spot diameter changes and an amount of light also changes. In addition, there is also a method of using a relay optical system as a method of providing the conjugate point of the aperture stop on the deflection surface. However, when the relay optical system is used, a required number of optical elements increases, which is not preferable in terms of space and costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The above description is set forth as if it is on the premise that there are two light sources. However, the description is actually established in a case where there are more light sources as well. Given that lasers irradiating light on both ends in the main scanning direction is lasers A and B, respectively, the above description as it is can be applied to a worst combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the case of the multi-beam scanning optical system not having the BD slit in the BD optical system, the part of the edge of the BD sensor eventually severs as the BD slit. Thus, the right end of the BD slit may be read as a left end of an effective portion of the BD sensor, and the BD slit surface may be read as a light-receiving surface of the BD sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In addition, the scanning direction is from the left to the right in the figure in the above description. However, even if the scanning direction is reversed, the same description may apply except that the BD slit determining the writing start timing is changed from the right end to a left end of a BD slit on the right side not shown in the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Next, each embodiment of the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a main part sectional view in a main scanning direction (main scanning sectional view) of a first embodiment of a multi-beam scanning optical system of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Note that, in this specification, a surface formed by a light axis of scanning optical means and light beams deflected by a light deflector is defined as a main scanning cross section, and a surface that includes the light axis of the scanning optical means and is perpendicular to the main scanning cross section is defined as a sub scanning cross section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the figure, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a light source unit (light source means), which has, for example, two light-emitting portions (light sources) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>consisting of semiconductor lasers. Note that three or more light-emitting portions may be included. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the two light-emitting portions <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are spaced apart from each other in the main scanning direction and the sub scanning direction. A distance between the light-emitting portions is longer in the main scanning direction than in the sub scanning direction as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This is because a distance between actual light-emitting portions is longer than an actually required distance between the light-emitting portions in the sub scanning direction, and the distance between the light-emitting portions in the sub scanning direction is set at a desired value by rotating the light source unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the two light-emitting portions <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a collimator lens, which converts divergent light beams emitted from each of the light-emitting portions <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>into substantially parallel light beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> denotes a cylindrical lens, which has a predetermined refracting power only in the sub scanning direction. The cylindrical lens is arranged to be movable in the light axis direction when it is assembled in order to make adjustable a beam-condensing state in the sub scanning direction on a photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> discussed below. After the adjustment, the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> denotes an aperture stop as a second light beam limiting element, which forms the light beams that have been emitted from each of the light-emitting portions <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and transmitted through the collimator lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in a desired optimal beam shape. This aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is brought close to a deflection surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, whereby deflection points of the light beams emitted from each of the light-emitting portions <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are brought close to each other and sensitivity of deviation of a dot position with respect to focus deviation is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Note that each of the collimator lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the like constitutes an element of incident optical means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> denotes a light deflector as deflection means, which consists of, for example, a rotary polygon mirror and rotates in an arrow A direction in the figure at a constant speed by driving means (not shown) such as a motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> denotes scanning optical means having an f&thgr; characteristic, which has first and second two optical elements (f&thgr; lenses) <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, images two light beams deflected by the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in a spot shape on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which is a surface to be scanned, thereby forming two scanning lines. The scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> establishes an optically conjugate relationship between the vicinity of the deflection surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the vicinity of photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> within the sub scanning cross section, thereby realizing a toppling correcting function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> denotes a BD condensing lens, which has a predetermined power in the main scanning direction and the sub scanning direction and focuses (condenses) a plurality of light beams (BD light beams) for synchronization signal detection on a surface of a BD slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> provided in the vicinity of a BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> discussed below or in its vicinity. Note that, although the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is integrally formed with the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it may be independently provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> denotes a synchronization detection stop (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BD stop&rdquo;) as a first light beam limiting element, which is provided between the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the BD slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and defines a lens passing position when the BD light beams pass through the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, relative deviation of a writing position attributable to the fact that a convergent point of the BD light beams is apart from the BD slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> discussed below is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> denotes a return mirror (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BD mirror&rdquo;), which reflects a plurality of BD light beams for adjusting timing at a scanning start position on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> toward the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> denotes a synchronization detection slit (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BD slit&rdquo;), which is disposed in a condensing position of light beams converged by the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or in its vicinity and determines a writing position of an image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes a lens for establishing a conjugate relationship between the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BD conjugate lens&rdquo;), which corrects toppling of the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> denotes an optical sensor (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;BD sensor&rdquo;) as a synchronization detection element, which, in this embodiment, adjusts the timing of a scanning start position of image recording on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for each BD light beam using a synchronization signal (BD signal) obtained by detecting an output signal from the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Note that, although the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are provided as separate members in this embodiment, an action of a BD stop may be given to an edge portion of the BD mirror or to a BD mirror holding member for holding the BD mirror as in third and fourth embodiments discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In addition, each of the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the BD slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the BD conjugate lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the like described above constitutes an element of synchronization detection optical means (a BD optical system). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, two light beams optically modulated and emitted from the light source unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to image information are converted into the substantially parallel light beams by the collimator lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and are incident on the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The light beams incident on the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are directly projected within the main scanning cross section. In addition, the light beams converge within the sub scanning cross section to be formed substantially as linear images (linear images elongated in the main scanning direction) on the deflection surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this case, a size of a cross section of the light beam is limited by the aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Then, the two light beams reflected and deflected by the deflection surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are imaged in a spot shape on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is rotated in the arrow A direction, the light beams are scanned on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in an arrow B direction (main scanning direction) at a uniform speed. Consequently, an image is recorded on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> functioning as a recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In this case, in order to adjust the timing at a scanning start position on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> before optically scanning the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a part of the two light beams reflected and deflected by the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is passed through the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to be condensed on the surface of the BD slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> with respect to the main scanning cross section via the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and then guided to the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the BD conjugate lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, the timing at the scanning start position of image recording on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is adjusted for each BD light beam using the synchronization signal (BD signal) obtained by detecting the output signal from the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Here, effects and the like of the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not provided, writing positions of A and B lights deviate and a printed image is deteriorated when a focus position of the BD light beams viewed from the surface of the BD slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> deviates as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In order to sufficiently obtain the effects of the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is required to be set such that at least a width in the main scanning direction of all the BD light beams is determined by the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at each instance when each BD light beam starts to be incident on the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, whereby main light positions in the main scanning direction of all the BD light beams become identical (overlapped) after passing through the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is structured in this way. If widths of some BD light beams are not determined by the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, only these BD light beams are incident on the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in a different position. Thus, for example, if the focus deviates, writing positions corresponding to these BD light beams relatively deviate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The relative deviation of a writing position due to focus deviation viewed from the BD slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be reduced by providing the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the BD optical system. However, if the focus position of the light beams condensed by the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> viewed from the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> deviates in this case, the relative positional relationship of the A and B lights in the main scanning direction deviates compared with the ideal case (such a phenomenon is hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;deviation of a dot position&rdquo;), and the effects of the above-mentioned measures are reduced by half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Thus, in this embodiment, given that a distance from the aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the deflection point on the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is d &lsqb;mm&rsqb;, a maximum value of a distance in the main scanning direction of light-emitting portions of a plurality of light beams is w &lsqb;mm&rsqb;, a focal length within the main scanning cross section of the incident optical means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is fn &lsqb;mm&rsqb;, and a focal length within the main scanning cross of the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is fs &lsqb;mm&rsqb;, each element is set such that the following conditional expression is met. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>d&middot;w</italic></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>fn&middot;fs</italic></highlight>)&lt;0.003&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> That is, in this embodiment, the maximum value of the distance in the main scanning direction between the light-emitting portions of the plurality of light beams &ldquo;w&rdquo; is set at 0.09 mm, the focal length of the collimator lens of the incident optical means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> &ldquo;fn&rdquo; is set at 24.6 mm, the focal length in the main scanning direction of the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> &ldquo;fs&rdquo; is set at 136.2 mm, and the distance from the aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the deflection point of the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> &ldquo;d&rdquo; is set at 33.2 mm, whereby the above-mentioned conditional expression (1) is met as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>d&middot;w</italic></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>fn&middot;fs</italic></highlight>)&equals;0.0009&lE;0.003 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> More preferably, it is desired that the above-mentioned conditional expression (1) be as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>d&middot;w</italic></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>fn&middot;fs</italic></highlight>)&lE;0.0018&emsp;&emsp;(1&prime;) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided between the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the BD slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as described above. This is for preventing the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from interfering with lights that should travel to the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, for example, when the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is disposed on the light source unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side over the BD condensing lens (scanning optical means) <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. It is needless to mention that the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be disposed on the light source unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side over the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> if the BD light beams and the lights that should travel to the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are sufficiently spaced apart from each other before the BD condensing lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In this way, in this embodiment, the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as the first light beam limiting element is provided in a part of the BD optical system as described above, whereby relative deviation of a writing position of each light beam due to deviation of a focus position within the main scanning cross section of light beams guided to the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> viewed from the slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is reduced to obtain an accurate synchronization signal. In addition, each of the incident optical means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the like is appropriately set so as to meet the conditional expression (1), whereby the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be scanned with well-focussed light beams. Consequently, jitter between the light beams on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be eliminated and scanning can be performed with a preferable spot diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Note that, in this embodiment, a time interval from the time when the A light is incident on the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an output signal is generated from the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> until the time when printing on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is started, and a time interval from the time when the B light is incident on the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an output signal is generated from the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> until the time when printing on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is started, are assumed to be equal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a main part sectional view in a main scanning direction (main scanning sectional view) of a multi-beam scanning optical system of a second embodiment of the present invention. In the figure, elements identical with those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are denoted by the same reference symbols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is different from the first embodiment in points including the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> 1. The BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is independent from the scanning optical system <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and is integral with the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to form a composite optical element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> 2. The aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are integrally formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> 3. A rotating direction of the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a direction C and a scanning direction on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a direction D, which are opposite from those in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> 4. The BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the BD conjugate lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are not provided. The other elements and optical actions are substantially the same as the first embodiment. Consequently, the second embodiment realizes similar effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> That is, in this embodiment, the focal length in the main scanning direction of a BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is made shorter than the focal length in the main scanning direction of the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, whereby the optical path length from the deflection point of the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is reduced, and the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the BD conjugate lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> establishing a conjugate relationship between the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are made unnecessary to reduce the number of components. In addition, the number of components is further reduced and the structure of the scanning optical system is simplified to reduce costs by the integration of the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as well as the aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Since the multi-beam scanning optical system has a plurality of light-emitting portions, wavelengths of the light-emitting portions may be different from each other in the order of several nm. In such a case, scanning widths differ by a magnification chromatic aberration of the scanning optical means. When such a phenomenon occurs, if a part of the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is used as the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as in the first embodiment, since writing start timing is determined taking into account the magnification chromatic aberration, the A and B lights are apart from each other on a writing end side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in this embodiment, since the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is independent from the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and lights pass the vicinity of light axis of the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the magnification chromatic aberration occurs little in the BD optical system. Consequently, since the writing start timing is not affected by the magnification chromatic aberration and equally deviates on the writing start side and the writing end side, deterioration of a printed image is reduced compared with the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> However, since the focal length in the main scanning direction of the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is made shorter than the focal length in the main scanning direction of the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, if the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not provided, relative deviation of a writing position with respect to focus deviation of the BD optical system tends to appear more largely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Since this embodiment is configured with the focal length of the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> fn&equals;42.7 mm and the focal length in the main scanning direction of the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> fs&equals;109.0 mm, the deviation of a writing position due to the focus deviation on the surface of the BD slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> tends to appear 6.5 times as often as the deviation of a dot position due to the focus deviation on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is required to increase positional accuracy of the focus on the surface of the BD slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> However, in this embodiment, the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided as described above, whereby the focus in the BD optical system is treated less strictly as in the conventional apparatus having only one light-emitting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is configured such that widths of all the BD light beams in the main scanning direction are determined by the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at each instance when all the BD light beams start to be incident on the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Next, the second embodiment will be described with specific examples of numerical values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the maximum value of the distance in the main scanning direction between the light-emitting points of the plurality of light beams &ldquo;w&rdquo; is set at 0.09 mm, the focal length of the collimator lens <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the incident optical means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> &ldquo;fn&rdquo; is set at 16.6 mm, the focal length in the main scanning direction of the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> &ldquo;fs&rdquo; is set at 109.0 mm, and the distance from the aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the deflection point of the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> &ldquo;d&rdquo; is set at 28.6 mm, whereby the above-mentioned conditional expression (1) is met as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>d&middot;w</italic></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>fn&middot;fs</italic></highlight>)&equals;0.0014&lE;0.003&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Consequently, deviation of a main scanning dot due to the deviation of a focus position on the photosensitive drums surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided between the deflection surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This is because, if the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is placed on the light source unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side over the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, positions where lights are incident on the light deflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are different for each light as in the case where the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not provided. Thus, positions where lights are incident on the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are different for each light and, as a result, the relative deviation of a writing position cannot be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided behind the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the relative deviation of a writing position can be reduced. However, in this case, not only a width of each light beam is narrowed compared with a width before it is incident on the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> but also a change in the width of the light beam with respect to a light axis direction increases. Thus, a tolerance of the position of the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is strictly controlled and necessity of adjusting the position in the light axis direction of the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is likely to occur. Therefore, it is not so preferable to provide the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> behind the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is disposed in the above-mentioned position, whereby it becomes possible to integrally form the aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that are required to be disposed as close as possible to the deflection surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Note that, as an integral structure of the aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, for example, the aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be provided on one plate (light-shielding member) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, or the aperture stop <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> independent from each other may be structurally coupled to be integrated as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the composite optical element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> including the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is moved along the light axis of the BD optical system in order to adjust a condensing state in the sub scanning direction on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and is fixed after the adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Assuming that a direction in which the composite optical element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is moved is the light axis direction of the incident optical means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, since the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is decentered with respect to the light axis of the BD optical system as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and the condensing position of the BD light beams moves in the main scanning direction, this is not preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the composite optical element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is adjusted in the light axis direction of the BD optical system as in this embodiment, since the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> does not have a power in the main scanning direction, it never bends light in the main scanning direction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Note that, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, elements identical with those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are denoted by the same reference symbols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> It is needless to mention that, in both the cases, the position of the focus in the light axis direction of the BD light beam is changed. In particular, if the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is independent from the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as in this embodiment, since the focal length of the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is generally shorter, relative deviation of a writing position tends to appear more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> However, the relative deviation of a writing position can also be reduced by providing the BD stop <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to adjust the condensing state in the sub scanning direction on the photosensitive drum surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with the composite optical element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Third and Fourth Embodiments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a main part sectional view in a main scanning direction (main scanning sectional view) of a multi-beam scanning optical system of third and fourth embodiments of the present invention. In the figure, elements identical with those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> are denoted by the same reference symbols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The third and fourth embodiments are different from the second embodiment in points including the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> 1. The BD optical system is disposed on a upstream of the incident optical means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (incident optical means is provided between synchronization detection optical means and scanning optical means). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> 2. The BD light beams are reflected by the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> 3. The edge of the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or a holding member of the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (hereinafter also referred to as a mirror holder) serves also as the BD stop (first light beam limiting element). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The other elements and optical actions are substantially the same as the second embodiment. Consequently, the third and fourth embodiments realize similar effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In addition, the third and fourth embodiments are different from each other in that the edge of the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> serves also as the BD stop as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> in the third embodiment, while a holding member of the BD mirror (mirror holder) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>serves also as the BD stop in the fourth embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Note that, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, elements identical with those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> are denoted by the same reference symbols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In the third and fourth embodiments, since the BD optical system cannot be disposed between the incident optical means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the scanning optical means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> due to a problem in arrangement of light source means, the BD optical system is disposed on the upstream of the incident optical means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. In addition, since the edge of the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the holding member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> serves also as the BD stop, relative deviation of a writing position of each light-emitting portion hardly occurs, but deviation of an overall writing position occurs according to focus deviation of the BD optical system. Since it is not preferable that the overall writing position moves too much, the focal length of the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is made as long as 80 mm here. However, when the focal length of the BD condensing lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is this long, since the optical path length from the deflection surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the BD sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also becomes long, the optical path is folded using the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In this case, in the third embodiment, a BD stop is not provided anew, but a width of the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is given such that a light beam width is determined by the edge of the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as described above, whereby the BD mirror <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is caused to serve as a BD stop and relative deviation of a writing position is reduced. </paragraph>

This image data Di is inputted in an optical scanning unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having the structure shown in each of the first to tenth embodiments. Then, a light beam <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> modulated according to the image data Di is emitted from this optical scanning unit (multi-beam scanning optical system) <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and a photosensitive surface of a photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is scanned in a main scanning direction by this light beam <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> functioning as an electrostatic latent image bearing member (photosensitive member) is rotated clockwise by a motor <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Then, the photosensitive surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> moves in a sub scanning direction perpendicular to the main scanning direction with respect to the light beam <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> following this rotation. A charging roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for charging the surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> uniformly is provided above the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> so as to abut the surface.

<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> As described above, the light beam <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is modulated based on the image data Di. An electrostatic latent image is formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by irradiating this light beam <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. This electrostatic latent image is developed as a toner image by a developing device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> that is arranged to abut the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> on the downstream side of an irradiating position of the light beam <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> within a rotation cross section of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> than. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The toner image developed by the developing device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is transferred onto a sheet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which is a transferring material, below the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by a transferring roller (transferring device) <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> arranged to oppose the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The sheet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is contained in a sheet cassette <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> in front (on the right side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The sheet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can also be manually fed. A sheet feeding roller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is arranged at the end of the sheet cassette <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and delivers the sheet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in the sheet cassette <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to a conveying path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In this way, the sheet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having the unfixed toner image transferred thereon is further conveyed to a fixing device behind (on the left side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The fixing device is constituted by a fixing roller <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> having a fixing heater (not shown) in its inside and a pressurizing roller <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> arranged to be brought into pressed contact with this fixing roller <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The fixing roller fixes the unfixed toner image on the sheet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by heating the sheet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> conveyed from a transfer member while pressurizing it in a press contact portion the fixing roller <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and the pressurizing roller <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, relative deviation of a writing position of each light beam due to deviation of a focus position within a main scanning cross section of light beams guided by a BD sensor viewed from a BD slit (a light-receiving surface of a BD sensor if the BD slit is not provided) is reduced using a light beam limiting element (BD stop) as described above. Consequently, a multi-beam scanning optical system and an image forming apparatus using the same, which can realize high-speed and high-quality printing, can be attained. </paragraph>
