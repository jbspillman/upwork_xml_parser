<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> a. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally a label and a manufacturing method thereof, and, more particularly to a label that is a clean release magnet, and a manufacturing method thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> b. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A need exists for an improved label, having a magnet attached thereto, which may be efficiently and economically manufactured, and which may be adhered to a product and removed therefrom without damaging the product or obstructing the product label itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Magnetic labels are well known in the art and generally include advertising material printed on one side of label stock and a magnet permanently adhered to the other side. In use, magnetic labels are generally placed onto a metallic object and may serve the dual purpose of advertising a product, and securing paper and other such material underneath the magnetic label. Thus far, the usage potential of magnetic labels has been limited, in that the magnetic label typically requires a separate means of delivery to a customer than the advertised product itself. Moreover, if the magnetic label is affixed to an advertised product, removal of the label from the product in turn damages the product label itself, or may contaminate the product contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the past, magnetic labels were generally manufactured by permanently adhering printed material onto a magnet and thereafter cutting the magnets to a desired size or shape. The conventional manufacturing methods of the past have had limited potential, in that once the magnetic labels have been cut, a seller generally has to separately distribute the magnetic label with each product. For products manufactured by the thousands or millions, such distribution requirements can significantly increase the overall cost of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the art, there currently exist various other conventional magnetic labels, as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,237,837, 6,037,029, 6,024,278, 6,024,277, 5,924,624, 5,868,498, 5,676,307, 5,641,116, 5,458,282 and 4,488,922. The magnetic labels disclosed therein include basic components such as a label or advertising material affixed to a magnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These conventional magnetic labels however have several of the same disadvantages and drawbacks of the conventional magnetic labels, as described above. Some of the key drawbacks generally include the limited usage potential, wherein the seller is required to deliver the labels separately with each product, or wherein removal of the label from a product damages the product label itself. Likewise, from a manufacturing standpoint, the labels described in the above-identified U.S. Patents also do not facilitate or reduce the cost of manufacturing and distribution of products with the labels. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention solves the problems and overcomes the drawbacks and disadvantages of the prior art by providing a magnetic label, which may be adhered to and removed from a product without damaging the product label itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus an aspect of the present invention is to avoid the need to separately distribute a magnetic label with a product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a self adhering magnetic label, which may be affixed to the outside of a product packaging or container without contaminating the food products by the magnetic label and its components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention accomplishes these aspects by providing a clean release magnet label including a pressure sensitive carrier layer having a permanent or a clean release adhesive applied to a first face, and a clean release adhesive applied to a second face. A flexible or rigid magnet layer may be removably affixed to the pressure sensitive carrier layer with the clean release adhesive, and a filmic face layer, having printing thereon, may be attached to the magnet layer with an adhesive. The clean release magnet label may be placed on a product, and upon removal of the magnet layer from the pressure sensitive carrier layer, the magnet layer is non-tacky and without any sticky residue, or may be slightly-tacky. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For the clean release magnet described above, the pressure sensitive carrier layer may be clear, opaque or have printing thereon, and have a backing layer removably attached to it. Alternatively, sections of the pressure sensitive carrier layer may be clear, opaque or have printing thereon. The pressure sensitive carrier layer may be substantially coextensive with the magnet layer and the filmic face layer, or may be substantially smaller than the magnet layer and/or the filmic face layer. The filmic face layer may be plain paper, embossed or glossy paper, PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride), PET (Polyethylene Terephlatate) or Tyvek, or other materials known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the clean release magnet, the present invention provides a clean release magnet label including 3-&Sgr; LABEL STOCK having a label carrier layer with a self-adhesive backing layer for adhering to a product and a film layer disposed on the label carrier layer. The film layer has a permanent adhesive on a top surface and a dry release adhesive on a bottom surface. The dry release adhesive has a circular pattern with the adhesive being disposed outside circles in the circular pattern. The label carrier layer is adhered to the film layer by the dry release adhesive. A magnet layer is removably affixed to the 3-&Sgr; LABEL STOCK with the permanent adhesive on the top surface of the film layer. When the magnet layer is removed from the label carrier layer, the film layer remains adhered to the magnet layer and the label carrier layer remains adhered to the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a method of manufacturing a clean release magnet. The method includes the steps of printing information on a label layer having a self-adhering surface, thereby denoting a first layer. Next, a pressure sensitive carrier layer, having a clean release adhesive on a first surface and a permanent or clean release adhesive on a second surface, may be affixed to a magnet layer, to thereby denote a second layer. The pressure sensitive carrier layer may also include a backing layer. Thereafter the first layer may be affixed to the second layer, adjacent the magnet layer, to thereby denote a third layer. The third layer may then be cut, for example, by die-cutting to a predetermined depth. The predetermined depth may be defined by a distance from a top of the clean release magnet to a bottom of the clean release magnet, excluding a thickness of the backing layer. The clean release magnet may be manually or automatically placed on a product, and upon removal of the magnet layer from the pressure sensitive carrier layer, the magnet layer and the pressure sensitive carrier layer are non-tacky. For the cutting step, the third layer may be separated into a usable product matrix and a waste product matrix, and the waste product matrix may be discarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Additional features, advantages, and embodiments of the invention may be set forth or apparent from consideration of the following detailed description, drawings, and claims. Moreover, it is to be understood that both the foregoing summary of the invention and the following detailed description are exemplary and intended to provide further explanation without limiting the scope of the invention as claimed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> clean release magnet according to the present invention, generally designated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, may include a clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a permanent adhesive (not shown) applied to the back surface thereof so as to enable permanent affixation of clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> onto any type of product or item. Clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may alternatively have a clean release adhesive (not shown) applied to its back surface, instead of the permanent adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be affixed to the clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a clean release adhesive <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Clean release adhesive <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> allows flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be peeled off or removed from clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, without leaving a tacky or sticky residue on flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or on the exposed surface of clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Although layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has been denoted as a clear pressure sensitive carrier layer, it should be evident that layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be clear, opaque or have printing thereon, or any combination thereof, as would be apparent to a skilled artisan. Moreover, it should be apparent that magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be flexible or rigid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be adhered to flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to allow for either removable or fixed attachment to flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be made of conventional label stock, such as plain paper, embossed or glossy paper, PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride), PET (Polyethylene Terephlatate), or Tyvek. Clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be substantially coextensive with flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or instead may be substantially smaller than flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown next in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be permanently attached onto a product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the permanent adhesive (not shown) on the back of clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In use, clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be removed from product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and placed onto a metallic object (i.e. a refrigerator). As described above, it should be noted that when clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is removed from clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the back side of clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the front side of clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are non-tacky. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, upon removal of clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, any pre-printed label <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is visible through clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is opaque or has printing thereon, clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be removed from product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to reveal the printing on layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An alternate embodiment of clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the alternate embodiment of clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, instead of using clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as discussed above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, </cross-reference>3-&Sgr; LABEL STOCK may be used. 3-&Sgr; LABEL STOCK, generally designated <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, consists of a standard label carrier <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with a self adhesive backing layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for permanent affixation to a product (not shown). The top of standard label carrier <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a clear film of dry-release glue <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> thereon disposed in a circular pattern <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that dry-release glue <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is present on all areas of the surface of standard label carrier <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, except within the boundaries of the circles in circular pattern <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A second layer of clear film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, having a permanent adhesive layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on its top surface, is affixed to standard label carrier <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by dry-release glue <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be affixed to clear film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by permanent adhesive layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The absence of dry-release glue <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the circles in circular pattern <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> facilitates removal of flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> affixed to clear film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> from standard label carrier <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removed from the product, clear film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> remains permanently affixed to flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by permanent adhesive layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and standard label carrier <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> remains affixed to the product. Therefore when flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removed from the product, clear film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> affixed thereto has a &ldquo;ghost image&rdquo; of dry-release glue <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> outlined by circular pattern <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and standard label carrier <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> affixed to the product also has a &ldquo;ghost image&rdquo; of dry-release glue <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> outlined by circular pattern <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For the alternate embodiment of clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including the 3-&Sgr; LABEL STOCK, instead of clear film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> affixed to flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may include printing thereon. Additionally, a coupon or game piece (not shown) may be overlaid on the top surface of standard label carrier <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and/or the top surface of flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing method for clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In order to manufacture clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, advertising or promotional materials, may be printed on a continuous roll of pressure sensitive, self-adhering label material (not shown), denoting a first roll made of printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is placed on a first spindle (not shown). The label material may have a pressure sensitive backing layer (not shown) and, as described above, may be made of conventional label stock, such as plain paper, embossed or glossy paper, PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride), PET (Polyethylene Terephlatate), or Tyvek. The label material may be retained on a roll (not shown) so as to be easily inserted into a machine (not shown) for subsequent processing. In the rolled configuration, the pressure sensitive backing on the label material may remain attached to the label material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A roll of flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a roll of clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a backing layer (not shown), may be simultaneously fed through a machine so that flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is affixed to the upper side of clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by using clean release adhesive <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The merged material may be re-wound onto a single roll, denoting a second roll, which is placed on a second spindle (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The rolls of printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the first spindle and flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the second spindle may then be simultaneously fed into the machine. As these rolls are fed into the machine, the pressure sensitive backing layer (not shown) on printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is removed and printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is applied to the top surface of flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by virtue of adhesive layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, the rolls on the first and second spindles are &ldquo;married&rdquo; as they simultaneously go through the machine. As these rolls are fed through the machine, a calibrator (not shown) keeps register of the rolls, and the combination of materials described above on the &ldquo;married&rdquo; roll are also simultaneously die cut into desired shapes and sizes. The depth of the cut may extend through printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> only, and not through the backing layer on clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This cut divides the material of the &ldquo;married&rdquo; roll into a usable matrix and waste matrix. The waste matrix may be automatically stripped and rewound onto a waste roll (not shown) and the usable matrix made of the newly die cut material, including flexible magnets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> affixed to clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, may come off the machine on another roll (not shown). Thus, in a single step, the rolls of printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the first spindle and flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the second spindle may be simultaneously fed into the machine, and a roll of newly die cut material, including printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> affixed to flexible magnets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is in turn affixed to clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, may be output from the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, instead of the single step discussed above, the first roll including printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be merged with and adhered to the second roll of flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to form a third roll (not shown) of the combination of materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Next, the third roll may be re-fed into the machine to die cut the combination of materials, described above, into desired shapes and sizes. As the third roll is die cut, the depth of the cut may extend through printed filmic face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, flexible magnet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> only, and not through the backing layer. Thus the cut divides the material of the third roll into a usable matrix and waste matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The newly die cut material may then be rewound to form a fourth roll (not shown) and any of the waste matrix may be automatically discarded, leaving the individual printed die-cut clean release magnets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> affixed on the backing layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The clean release magnets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> created on the fourth roll, or created on the roll formed in the single step described above, may then be individually applied by hand or by machine at a rapid rate, for example, to a customer&apos;s product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to firmly attach clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the self-adhesive back side of clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. If clean release magnets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are applied by machine, the backing layer may be removed as waste and discarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As described above and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, when clean release magnets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is removed form the consumer product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is left on the product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The exposed surfaces of clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and clear pressure sensitive carrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are clear and non-tacky (of slightly-tacky) so that any pre-printed label <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is un-obscured, and product <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are easy to handle, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It should be apparent that the manufacturing method described above is only exemplary, and many other variations of the described method may be used to manufacture clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as would be apparent to a skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> For the above-described embodiments and manufacturing method of clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it should be evident that clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used for a variety of purposes and provides a consumer with a utilitarian and semi-permanent reminder of the product and brand name of the producer of the product. Clean release magnet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be manually or automatically applied to, for example a postcard mailer, or the like. Moreover, since the clean release magnet is capable of being affixed to the inside or outside of the product packaging or container, from an FDA standpoint, it can be used with food products, thereby reducing concerns about contamination of the food products by the magnetic label and its components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described in detail herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those particular embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
