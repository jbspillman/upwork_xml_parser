<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to automotive accessories and, in particular, to a signaling wiring assembly for vehicles. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Vehicle running boards provide a convenient way to facilitate the entry and exit of a vehicle. Running boards typically extend from the front of the rear wheel to the back of the front wheel. As part of the courtesy lamp system of a vehicle, manufacturers have provided vehicle running boards with lighting assemblies which cause the running board to be illuminated when the vehicle doors are manually opened or ajar, or when the vehicle is unlocked by using a wireless remote. Typically, such lighting assemblies on the running board include elongated light strips formed of a flexible polymer tube having small bulbs electrically connected in parallel through the tube. A conventional running board with a lighting assembly disposed on the outer-side or under-side of the running board is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,557,494 to Elwell, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As travel safety is becoming increasingly important, vehicle manufacturers have added various features for enhancing visibility and safety, including supplemental lights for increasing the visibility of motor vehicles and for indicating vehicular braking and turn signaling. In this regard, although factory installed lights on vehicle running boards are included on many vehicles as part of the courtesy lamp system, it would be desirable to utilize one or more of those lights on the running board to provide a turn signal indication on the running boards to improve turn signaling visibility from the side of the vehicle. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention achieves the foregoing objective by providing a wiring light assembly for a vehicular running board that adapts an existing running board lighting system to provide an indication of vehicular turn signaling. The wiring light assembly of the present invention accordingly increases side visibility when the vehicle is turning left or right, or is changing lanes left or right, by causing existing courtesy lamps on the running board of the vehicle to flash in synchronism with the designated turn signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the invention provides a wiring light assembly which is electronically connected in line, without the need to cut wires, with the existing vehicular wiring to the courtesy lamps on the running boards of motor vehicles, for example, Ford or Lincoln vehicles such as Ford Expedition, Ford Excursion, Ford King Ranch or Lincoln Navigator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The wiring light assembly of the present invention is installed in series with an existing courtesy lamp circuit, and uses the electrical current of the existing courtesy lamp circuit, together with the existing electrical turn signals of the motor vehicle, to cause one or more of the lamps on the running board to blink to indicate a designated vehicle turn signal. Accordingly, the present invention allows a motor vehicle with courtesy lamps on the running boards to be easily retrofitted so as to provide turn signal indication, which is particularly useful when the vehicle is changing lanes. The present invention is furthermore designed such that, when the hazard lights of the vehicle are flashing, the running board lamps flash in synchronism with the other flashing lights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These and other features and advantages of the invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description that is provided in connection with the accompanying drawings and illustrated exemplary embodiments of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and that structural, logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a wiring light assembly that is electrically connected in line with a running board light system of a preexisting courtesy lamp system, for example, a courtesy lamp system for Ford Expedition, Ford Excursion, Ford King Ranch and Lincoln Navigator, which adds turn signal indication capability to the running boards without affecting the normal function of the courtesy lamp system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, where like elements are designated by like reference numerals, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary courtesy lamp wiring diagram <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> showing the points at which the wiring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention is connected, to form a retrofitted wiring assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment of the invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the invention is connected to the pre-existing courtesy lamp system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a Ford Expedition, a Ford Excursion or a Lincoln Navigator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As known in the art, each of the Ford Expedition, Ford Excursion, Ford King Ranch and Lincoln Navigator vehicles has a courtesy lamp system, such as the courtesy lamp system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which operates to illuminate the interior dome lights and the running boards of the vehicle when the doors are manually opened or ajar, or when the vehicle is unlocked by using a wireless remote, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the wiring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention is electrically connected in series with hot and ground courtesy lamp wires <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively, of the pre-existing courtesy lamp system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The hot and ground courtesy lamp wires <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are further electrically connected to respective running board lamps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> located on each side of the vehicle. For simplicity, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the circuitry on only one side of the vehicle, for example, the left side. One wiretap of the wiring light assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used on each side of the vehicle, the one on the left side tapping into the left turn signal wire at the front of the vehicle, and the one on the right side tapping into the right turn signal wire at the front of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the running board lights <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the wiring light assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided with male and female coupling connectors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, respectively, such that no cutting of any vehicle wires is required to install the wiring assembly of the present invention. Since the circuitry of the present invention uses running board lamps for signaling, the color of the bulbs in the running board lamps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> located on the running boards (each running board has two bulbs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) is changed to amber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates in detail diodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the wiring assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Diode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is connected to the vehicle courtesy lamp system via connector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and is oriented so as to prevent the other vehicle courtesy lamps from flashing when the turn signal is activated. In similar fashion, diode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected to the turn signal circuitry <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the motor vehicle and is oriented so as to prevent the other vehicle turn signal lamps from illuminating when the courtesy lamps are activated, for example, when a door is opened. With this arrangement, the running board lamps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provide the dual function of serving as courtesy lamps and turn signals for the running boards, without affecting any other lights on the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The retrofitted light wiring assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention increases side visibility when the vehicle is turning left or right, or is changing lanes left or right, by causing the existing courtesy lamps on the running board to flash in synchronism with the designated turn signal. As described above, by employing two diodes that direct the electrical current though an existing courtesy lamp system of a vehicle, the retrofitted light wiring assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the invention is designed so that, when the running board and signal lights are flashing, the interior courtesy lamps do not flash, and when the vehicle is unlocked with the wireless remote, or the doors are open or ajar, the turn signals lights do not illuminate. Similarly, when the hazard flashers are engaged, the running board lamps flash in synchronism with the other flashing lights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The above description and drawings are only to be considered illustrative of exemplary embodiments, which achieve the features and advantages of the invention. Modification and substitutions to specific process conditions and structures can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be considered as being limited by the foregoing description and drawings, but is only limited by the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
