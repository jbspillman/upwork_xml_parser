<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method of battery pack manufacture, and in particular to a battery pack and its method of manufacture wherein batteries and output terminals are inserted into a mold in a process step to form an external plastic case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A battery pack formed by inserting batteries into a molded plastic resin region, which serves as the external battery pack case, has been developed. This type of battery pack is cited in Japanese Non-examined Patent Publication 2000-315483. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and batteries <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are inserted and fixed in the mold when a molded plastic resin region is formed and becomes the external case of the battery pack. Unlike related art battery packs, this battery pack does not require battery and printed circuit board insertion and assembly in a separately formed case. Here, the printed circuit board and batteries are held in fixed positions during the molding step to form the molded plastic resin region which becomes the case. This type of battery pack can be manufactured inexpensively in quantity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, when the battery pack shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is actually manufactured in quantity, it has the drawback of poor yield. This is because the molded plastic resin region is difficult to form in a precise configuration. In particular, error in printed circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> dimensions makes molding difficult for a battery pack which inserts the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> into the molded plastic resin region. The printed circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is inserted and temporarily held in the mold cavity <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> for molding in the plastic resin region. However, a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with error in its dimensions cannot be temporarily held in a precise position in the mold <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This is because the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is slid into, or sandwiched into the mold to temporarily hold it in a fixed position in the mold cavity <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The mold <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is designed to allow a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with maximum dimensions to be slid or sandwiched into the mold cavity <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and temporarily held. Consequently, a printed circuit board smaller than maximum dimensions cannot be temporarily held in the proper position, and it also cannot be reliably retained in that position. A printed circuit board which cannot be reliably retained in the mold cavity can easily become further out of position when molten plastic resin is injected into the mold cavity. Therefore, this battery pack has the drawback that the inserted printed circuit board moves out of position. In a battery pack having output terminals attached to a printed circuit board, and having those output terminals exposed outside the molded plastic resin region, there is a further drawback of plastic resin attaching to the surfaces of the output terminals. The cross-section view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a mold to form a plastic resin region that exposes the output terminals outside that molded plastic resin region. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is necessary to tightly contact the mold <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to the output terminals <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> at the exposed areas. If space is left here, plastic resin can ingress into the gap left between the mold <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the output terminals <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> as shown by the broken lines of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This will cover the output terminals <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> with plastic resin. In particular, high manufacturing efficiency injection molding injects molten synthetic resin into the mold cavity <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> at extremely high pressures. Therefore, molten plastic resin can ingress into even small gaps and reduce yield. A battery pack with plastic resin on its output terminals does not allow electrical connection of the output terminals to power supply terminals of an electrical apparatus and is a reject part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> connector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> provided with output terminals at the end of lead wires <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is attached to a battery pack having parts such as a printed circuit board which cannot be accurately positioned in the mold. In a battery pack of this configuration, output terminals are not embedded within the molded plastic resin region, and yield can be improved. However, not only does attachment of lead wires <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> make fabrication more complex, temporary placement within the mold <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is also troublesome. This is because battery pack parts are temporarily placed in the mold cavity <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> with lead wires <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> pulled outside the mold <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, this battery pack has the drawback that lead wires can be easily open circuited. In addition, electrical equipment which attaches a battery pack having lead wires must provide internal space to accommodate the lead wires and connector. Therefore, it also has the drawback that space for holding the battery pack becomes greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention was developed to eliminate drawbacks of the type mentioned above. Thus it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a battery pack and its method of manufacture wherein output terminals can be inserted in a mold and accurately positioned within the plastic resin mold region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The above and further objects and features of the invention will more fully be apparent from the following detailed description with accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The battery pack of the present invention is provided with a battery, output terminals to bring out the electrodes of the battery, and a molding holder to mate with the battery and retain the output terminals. In this battery pack, at least the battery, the molding holder, and its connecting region are inserted into a molded plastic resin region. The molded plastic resin region exposes the output terminal surfaces, and also joins the battery, output terminals, and molding holder as a single unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Preferably, output terminals are fixed to a printed circuit board of the battery pack of the present invention, and the molding holder is disposed between this printed circuit board and the battery. The printed circuit board can be disposed parallel to the end plane of the battery. The printed circuit board is connected to positive and negative battery electrodes via lead plates. In this battery pack, the molding holder is sandwiched and held between the printed circuit board and battery, and the printed circuit board, molding holder, and end region of the battery are inserted and molded into the plastic resin region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The molded plastic resin region preferably comprises end cover segments disposed to enclose both ends of the battery, and connection segments to join the end cover segments at both ends of the battery. Connection segments can be positioned along the corner regions of edges of the external battery case. Further, corner regions of edges of the external battery case can be beveled, and connection segments can be positioned along these beveled-edge corner regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The method of manufacture of the present invention fabricates a battery pack provided with a battery, output terminals to bring out the electrodes of the battery, and a molding holder to mate with the battery and retain the output terminals. In this method of manufacture, the molding holder, output terminals, and battery are temporarily retained in a mold, and synthetic resin in the molten state is injected into the mold cavity. Further, in this method of manufacture, at least the connecting region of the battery and molding holder are inserted into the plastic resin region formed by the mold. In addition, the molded plastic resin region is formed to expose the output terminal surfaces from the plastic resin, and to join the battery, output terminals, and molding holder as a single unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the method of manufacture of the present invention, output terminals can be fixed to a printed circuit board, the molding holder can be disposed between this printed circuit board and the battery, and this assembly can be inserted and molded into the plastic resin region. The printed circuit board can be disposed parallel to the end plane of the battery, and it can be connected to positive and negative battery electrodes via lead plates. The molding holder is sandwiched between the printed circuit board and battery and temporarily retained in the mold, molten synthetic resin is injected into the mold cavity, and the printed circuit board, molding holder, and end region of the battery are embedded in the molded plastic resin region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further, in the method of manufacture of the present invention, the plastic resin region can be formed by the mold with end cover segments disposed to enclose both ends of the battery, and with connection segments to join the end cover segments at both ends of the battery. Preferably, the molded plastic resin region is formed with connection segments positioned along the corner regions of edges of the external battery case. In this molded plastic resin region, a battery having an external case with beveled-edge corner regions can be temporarily held in the mold cavity, and connection segments can be formed along the beveled-edge corner regions of the external battery case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The battery pack and its method of manufacture described above has the characteristic that output terminals can be inserted in accurate positions within the molded plastic resin region. This is because the battery pack and method of manufacture of the present invention connects output terminals to the battery via a molding holder formed separately from the molded plastic resin region, and the molded plastic resin region is formed with the molding holder, output terminals, and battery inserted in that region. The molding holder can be molded with extremely high precision compared to components such as the external battery case. Consequently, a configuration joining the output terminals to the battery via the molding holder can embed those components in the molded plastic resin region while disposing the output terminals in an accurate position with respect to the battery. In this manner, the battery pack and method of manufacture of the present invention, which allows output terminals to be inserted in accurate positions in the molded plastic resin region, can effectively prevent ingress of plastic resin between the output terminals and the mold during formation of the molded plastic resin region, and can effectively prevent output terminals surfaces from being covered with plastic allowing yield increase.</paragraph>
