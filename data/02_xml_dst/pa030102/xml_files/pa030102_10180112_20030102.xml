<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to methods for detecting photons, radiations or neutrons using superconductors and methods for obtaining two-dimensional images thereof. The invention is particularly characterized by using MgB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as a superconductor having isotopes that become adequately superconducting at the temperature of liquid helium. The invention also realizes imaging with high position resolution by using a two-dimensional imaging method that detects phonons with a superconductor sensor as they are generated from a superconducting or single-crystal detection medium. The invention is therefore applicable to the fabrication of sensors for use in experiments or analyses with photons shorter than a few microns, X-rays or neutrons. It also finds utility in analytical techniques that take advantage of its ability to detect both the incident energy and position of photons, radiations or neutrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An X-ray detector of high energy resolution using a Nb/Al/Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/Al/Nb tunnel junction device has been developed by Matsumura et al. (Matsumura et al., Nucl. Instrum. &amp; Methods, A329 (1993) 227) and other researchers and used as a superconductor-based radiation detector. An imaging detector for detecting the incident energy and position of a radiation with the intermediary of phonons generated from a superconducting or single-crystal radiation detection medium has been developed by Kurakado et al. (Kurakado et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 62 (1991) 156) and other researchers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the contemplated prior art technology, Nb has been used as a superconductor; particularly, in the case of detectors using a superconducting tunnel junction, it was necessary to cool them to a temperature about a tenth of the critical temperature before use but cooling to about 0.4 K was time-consuming and required an expensive apparatus. It has therefore been desired to develop a superconducting detector that can be operated at higher temperatures. In addition, neutron imaging detectors were scanty that used superconductors. What is more, it has been very difficult to develop an imaging detector capable of detecting X-rays or neutrons at high position resolution. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVETNION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a superconducting detector device that uses MgB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>with a critical temperature above 30 K which has isotopes <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B and <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B with different energy gaps. The device has an incomparable detecting function and can be operated at the temperature of liquid helium. If MgB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B rather than <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B, a neutron detector and a neutron imaging detector can be constructed.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The first example of the invention as it relates to a photon, radiation and neutron detector is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this example, MgB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is used as a superconductor having a higher critical temperature than conventional superconductors such as Nb. The superconductor MgB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can be prepared in two forms enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B and <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B, respectively. The isotope effect realizes two superconductors <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B and <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B having different energy gaps. This effect was used to fabricate a five-layered superconducting tunnel junction device comprising in the order written an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of wide energy gap, an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of narrow energy gap, an insulation layer, an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of narrow energy gap and an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of wide energy gap. The Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layers were each about 500 nm thick and the Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layers were each about 50 nm thick. The insulation layer was about 2 nm thick. The isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of narrow energy gap formed a quasiparticle trapping layer which trapped the quasiparticles generated from the isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of wide energy gap and this enabled efficient detection of photons or radiations. Since the superconductor layer working as the detection medium and the trapping layer were made of isotopic superconductors, they were easier to make than the conventional Nb/Al layer and their continuity assured more efficient device operation. The design of Example 1 allowed for fabrication of a radiation detector capable of measuring the energy of radiations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The second example of the invention as it relates to a neutron detector is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Example 2 is identical to Example 1 except for the use of an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>containing the neutron converter boron (<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B) as a constituent element. By using the isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to detect the &agr;-rays emitted from <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B having a large neutron absorption cross-sectional area, we could fabricate a neutron detector using a superconducting tunnel junction device to be capable of efficient neutron detection. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The third example of the invention as it relates to a neutron detector is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In this example, an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>containing boron (B) as a constituent element was used to fabricate a four-layered superconducting tunnel junction device comprising in the order written an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of wide energy gap, an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of narrow energy gap, an insulation layer and an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of narrow energy gap. Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>formed a quasiparticle trapping layer. Since the Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>on one side rendered insensitivity to neutrons, the neutron detector of Example 3 was sensitive to neutrons only on the other side. The individual layers of the detector had the same thicknesses as in Example 1. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The fourth example of the invention as it relates to a neutron detector is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In this example, an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>containing boron (B) as a constituent element was used to fabricate a three-layered superconducting tunnel junction device comprising in the order written an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of wide energy gap, an insulation layer and an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of narrow energy gap. Since the Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>on one side rendered insensitivity to neutrons, the neutron detector of Example 3 was sensitive to neutrons only on the other side.

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 5 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The fifth example of the invention as it relates to a photon, X-ray and neutron detector is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In this example, an isotopic superconductor MgB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>containing boron (B) as a constituent element has the isotope effect which realizes two superconductors having different energy gaps. This effect was used to fabricate a three-layered superconducting tunnel junction device comprising in the order written an Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Mg<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gradient superconductor with a gradual compositional transition in the direction of thickness from a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B of the wider energy gap to a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B of the narrower energy gap, an insulation layer and an Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gradient superconductor with a gradual compositional transition in the direction of thickness from a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B of the wider energy gap to a superconductor <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B of the narrower energy gap. The two gradient superconductor layers were each about 500 nm thick and the insulation layer was about 2 nm thick. The quasiparticles generated in each gradient superconductor would migrate to the isotopic superconductor of the narrower energy gap, thereby allowing for efficient detection of photons, radiations or neutrons by the superconducting tunnel junction. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 6 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The sixth example of the invention as it relates to a neutron image sensor is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In this example, an isotopic superconductor MgB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>containing boron (B) as a constituent element has the isotope effect which realizes two superconductors having different energy gaps. This effect was used to fabricate a three-layered superconducting tunnel junction device comprising in the order written an Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gradient superconductor with a gradual compositional transition in a two-dimensional plane from a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B of the wider energy gap to a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B of the narrower energy gap, an insulation layer and an Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gradient superconductor with a gradual compositional transition in a two-dimensional plane from a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B of the wider energy gap to a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B of the narrower energy gap. The two gradient superconductor layers were each about 500 nm thick and the insulation layer was about 2 nm thick. On account of the Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gradient superconductor, different energy gaps, hence, varying pulse peaks would be output depending upon the incident position of photons, radiations or neutrons; as a result, photons or radiations incident with specified energy or neutrons emitting a specified energy of &agr;-rays could be detected for their image at high position resolution. This design enables the fabrication of a photon, radiation and neutron image detector using a superconducting tunnel junction device. </paragraph>

In this example, there is fabricated a five-layered superconducting tunnel junction device comprising in the order written an isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as a detection medium that is enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B of wide energy gap, an Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gradient superconductor with a gradual compositional transition in a two-dimensional plane from a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B of the wider energy gap to a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B of the narrower energy gap, an insulation layer, an Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gradient superconductor with a gradual compositional transition in a two-dimensional plane from a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B of the wider energy gap to a superconductor enriched in <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B of the narrower energy gap, and the other detection medium made of Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The two layers of the isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B of wide energy gap were each 500 nm thick, the gradient superconductor layers were each about 50 nm thick, and the insulation layer was about 2 nm thick. The Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gradient superconductors worked as quasiparticle trapping layers, so when the quasiparticles generated within Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>were detected in the superconducting tunnel junction, different energy gaps, hence, varying pulse peaks would be outputted depending upon the incident position of photons, radiations or neutrons; as a result, photons or radiations incident with specified energy or neutrons emitting a specified energy of &agr;-rays could be detected for their image at high position resolution. This design again enables the fabrication of a photon, radiation or neutron image detector using a superconducting tunnel junction device. </paragraph>

The isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>enriched in <highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B of wide energy gap has a different energy gap than the isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>enriched in <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B of narrow energy gap. To take advantage of this effect, the isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of wide energy gap was used as a detection plate which was provided with a phonon sensor at the center and the four corners in order to detect phonons generated in the plate which it was illuminated with a radiation. The phonon sensor had a two-layered structure consisting of an insulation layer overlaid with the isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>enriched in <highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B of narrow energy gap. Both the intensity and the propagation time of signals from the phonon sensors were both used to detect the incident position of a radiation. The detection plate made of the isotopic superconductor Mg<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>measured 2 mm<highlight><superscript>L</superscript></highlight>&times;2 mm<highlight><superscript>W</superscript></highlight>&times;0.2 mm<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>; the Mg<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer was 50 nm thick and the insulation layer was 2 nm thick. This design enables the fabrication of a radiation image detector using a superconducting tunnel junction device.
