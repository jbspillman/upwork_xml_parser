<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a structure for holding functional devices attached to a panel in a passenger compartment of a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Functional devices, such as switches, are mounted on an instrument panel of a vehicle to operate various types of electric equipment. Examples of such switches include a switch for adjusting the angle of a side view mirror and a switch for moving the side view mirror between a normal position and a folded position. Such switches are arranged separately from one another. Further, the function associated with each switch differs depending on the grade of the vehicle type or the selected option. This changes the number of switches mounted on the instrument panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Identical instrument panels may be used for different types of vehicles and different grades of the same vehicle type. In such a case, the number of openings formed to receive switches is in accordance with the grade in each vehicle type that has the largest number of switches mounted on the instrument panel. Thus, as the number of switches mounted on the instrument panel decreases, the number of openings that do not receive any switch increases. Such openings are covered by cover plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, the plates, which cover the openings that do not receive switches, degrade the aesthetic appearance of the instrument panel. The number of automated devices and communication-related devices operated by switches have been increasing. This has increased the difference between the number of switches mounted on instrument panels in accordance with grade in each vehicle type and the selected option. Further, the increased number of switches also degrades the aesthetic appearance of the instrument panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Functional devices are not limited to switches and also include coin cases and card cases. The number of such devices also changes in accordance with the grade of each vehicle type or the selected option. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a structure for holding functional devices that maintains the aesthetic appearance of a panel in a passenger compartment of a vehicle regardless of the number of functional devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a structure for holding a functional device in a passenger compartment of a vehicle. The structure includes a first functional unit arranged on a panel in the passenger compartment. The first functional unit includes a functional device. A second functional unit is arranged adjacent to the first functional unit. A common shaft is shared by the first and second functional units and pivotally supports the first and second functional units. The first and second functional units are each pivoted about the common shaft between a retracted position and an operational position. The first and second functional units are each accommodated in the panel when located at the retracted position and exposed from the panel when located at the operational position. The first functional unit remains at the retracted position when the second functional unit is located at the operational position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further perspective of the present invention is a structure for holding a functional device in a passenger compartment of a vehicle. The structure includes a switchboard arranged on a panel in the passenger compartment. The switchboard includes a functional device. An accommodating case is arranged adjacent to the switchboard. A holder holds the switchboard and the accommodating case in the panel. A common shaft is shared by the switchboard and the accommodating case and pivotally supports the switchboard and the accommodating case. The switchboard and the accommodating case are each pivoted about the common shaft between a retracted position and an operational position. The switchboard and the accommodating case are each accommodated in the panel when located at the retracted position and exposed from the panel when located at the operational position. The switchboard remains at the retracted position when the accommodating case is located at the operational position. A first spring connects the switchboard and the accommodating case to each other and urges the accommodating case toward the operational position. The first spring pivots the accommodating case integrally with the switchboard when the switchboard is pivoted between the retracted position and the operational position. A second spring connects the switchboard and the holder to each other and urges the switchboard toward the operational position. A lever is connected to the switchboard and has an engaging pin. A cam is pivotally supported on the holder and has a guide groove that engages the engaging pin. A third spring urges the cam in a predetermined direction to arrange the switchboard at the operational position. The third spring engages the engaging pin with the guide groove to hold the switchboard at the retracted position. When the lever is moved against the urging force of the third spring, the engaging pin is disengaged from the guide groove and the urging force of the second spring moves the switchboard to the operational position. A restriction pin is arranged on the accommodating case. The restriction pin contacts the cam and restricts the disengagement of the engaging pin from the guide groove of the cam when the accommodating case is located at the operational position. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A structure for holding functional devices according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be discussed with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a switch box <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed in one end of an instrument panel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The switch box <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and an accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which serve as functional units. The switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are adjacent to each other. Switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> used to operate electric devices are mounted on the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The surface of the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on which the switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are mounted serves as a functional plane, which has a functional role. The switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> serve as functional devices. The switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> move between a retracted position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and operational positions (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). The switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has two operational positions, a first operational position and a second operational position. The switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is half-opened when in the first operational position (the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and fully opened when in the second operational position (the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The structure of the switch box <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be discussed with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The switch box <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The instrument panel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has an external surface D in which a holder opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed. The holder opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>receives the holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends into the instrument panel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and has a plurality of tongues <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which are engaged with engaging portions lib defined in the inner side R of the instrument panel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Further, the holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> accommodates the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>.

Further, the front surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the front surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the support <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are partially flush with the external surface D of the instrument panel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This improves the aesthetic appearance of the instrument panel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are retracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> (6) The push-open mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> moves the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between the retracted position and the operational positions. Further, the turnover mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> moves the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> between the retracted position and the operational position. Thus, the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> smoothly move between the accommodating and operational positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> (7) The restriction pin <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> restricts the movement of the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the retracted position to the operational positions when the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the operational position. Thus, the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is prevented from being unintentionally moved from the retracted position to the operational positions when the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is located in the operational position and opened. Accordingly, there is no interference when the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> (8) The switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is pivoted between two stages, the first operational position and the second operational position. This enables the grouping of the switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in accordance with how frequently the switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are used. Thus, the convenience of the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> (9) The shift arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is employed to move the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the first operational position to the second operational position. This smoothens the pivoting of the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the first operational position to the second operational position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> (10) The switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are divided into the first switch group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second switch group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in accordance with how often the switches are operated. Further, the first switch group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which includes switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that are relatively often used, is arranged on the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at a location exposed to the vehicle occupant when the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is located at the first operational position. The second switch group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which includes switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that are not used often, is arranged on the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at a location that is not exposed to the vehicle occupant when the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is located at the first operational position but exposed when the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is located at the second operational position. Accordingly, the switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are arranged in an efficient manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> (11) The indicator LEDs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the illumination LEDs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to the switch substrate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, in a dark environment, such as during the nighttime, the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be illuminated. This facilitates the operation of the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the accommodating case <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Further, the switch box <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with illumination functions without significantly increasing costs simply by connecting LEDs to the switch substrate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> (12) A plurality of switches are normally attached to the instrument panel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> within a limited area. However, by attaching the switch box <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the instrument panel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the number of switch openings that are closed by cover plates are drastically reduced. Thus, the present invention is especially advantageous when using the same instrument panel for different vehicle types or different grades of the same vehicle type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment according to the present invention will now be discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, like or same reference numerals are given to those components that are the same as the corresponding components in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, a restriction arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is used in lieu of the shift arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment to restrict further pivoting of the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from a half-opened position (operational position) when the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is moved from the retracting position to the operational position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the restriction arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> differs from the shift arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment only in that the shift button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is not provided. One end of the restriction arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is pivotally supported about a pivot shaft <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. A hook <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, which is engaged with the hooking portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is formed on the other end of the restriction arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Like the first embodiment, the plate spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> urges the restriction arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> upward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> To shift the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the retained position to an operational position in the switch box <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment, the vehicle occupant presses the front surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the support <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. This causes the push-open mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to pivot the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrow A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. When the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is pivoted by a predetermined amount, the hook <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> of the restriction arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> engages the hooking portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This restricts further pivoting of the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrow A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In this state, the plate spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> applies an urging force to the restriction arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Further, the restriction arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> does not have the shift button <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Thus, the hook <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> of the restriction arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> remains engaged with the hooking portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> does not pivot to a fully opened position from the half-opened position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In addition to advantages (1) to (7), (11), and (12), the second embodiment has the advantage described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> (13) The restriction arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> restricts further pivoting of the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the half-opened position. Thus, when the number of switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mounted on the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is small, the switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are mounted on part of the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so that all of the switches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are exposed to the vehicle occupant when the switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is located at the half-opened position. Accordingly, the same switchboard <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be used for different types of vehicles or for different grades of the same type of vehicle. This reduces manufacturing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
