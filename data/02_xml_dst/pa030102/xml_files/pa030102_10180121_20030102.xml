Optical modulation elements, spaced at a regular interval in an alignment of optical modulation elements along the array-direction, are successively and selectively driven based on a same bit datum, to thereby modulate a light beam made incident thereon, whenever the exposure unit is moved by a distance corresponding to the regular interval, resulting in the production of a pixel dot on the drawing surface in a multi-exposure manner by the modulated light beams. The exposure time for producing the pixel dot by each of the modulated light beams is shorter than the time required to move the exposure unit by a distance corresponding to the size of one pixel dot. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a drawing method for drawing a pattern on a surface of a workpiece, using an exposure unit including a plurality of optical modulation elements arranged in a matrix manner, and also relates to a drawing apparatus in which the drawing method is executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, such a drawing apparatus is used for optically drawing fine patterns, characters, symbols and so on the surface of a suitable workpiece. A representative use of the drawing apparatus is for a circuit pattern drawn on a workpiece when a printed circuit board is manufactured by using photolithography. In this case, the workpiece may be either a photosensitive film for producing a photomask or a photoresist layer formed on a suitable substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recently, circuit pattern drawing systems have been developed for efficiently carrying out the drawing of circuit patterns by integrating the use of a drawing apparatus, a CAD (Computer Aided Design) station for designing a circuit pattern, and a CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) station for editing the designed circuit. The drawing apparatus, the CAD station, and the CAM station are all connected to each other through a LAN (local area network). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A circuit pattern is designed and treated as vector-graphic data by the CAD station. The vector-graphic data may be fed from the CAD station to the CAM station, through the LAN, for editing the designed circuit pattern, if necessary. The vector-graphic data is fed from either the CAD station or the CAM station to the drawing apparatus, and is stored in a storage medium, such as a hard disk, provided in the drawing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The drawing apparatus is provided with a vector-to-raster converter, and a bit-map memory. The vector graphic data is read from the hard disk, for example, and is converted into raster-graphic data by the vector-to-raster converter. Then, the raster-graphic data are developed and stored in the bit-map memory for a drawing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The drawing apparatus is further provided with an exposure unit for drawing a circuit pattern on the workpiece based on the raster-graphic data, and the exposure unit may comprise a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) unit, a liquid crystal display (LCD) array unit or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As is well known, the DMD unit has a reflecting surface which is formed from a plurality of micro-mirror elements arranged in a matrix manner. Each micro-mirror element is independently driven between a first reflecting position and a second reflecting position. Thus, it is possible to divide a light beam, which is wholly made incident on the reflecting surface of the DMD unit, into a plurality of light beams by independently driving each of the micro-mirror elements between the first and second reflecting positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the DMD unit assembled in the drawing apparatus, when each micro-mirror element is at the first reflecting position, it reflects the light beam such that the reflected light beam is directed toward the workpiece, and when each micro-mirror element is at the second reflecting position, it reflects the light beam such that the reflected light beam deviates from the workpiece. Thus, since each of the micro-mirror elements serves as an optical modulation element, it is possible to draw the circuit pattern on the workpiece by operating the DMD unit in accordance with the raster-graphic data read from the bit-map memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Also, as is well known, the LCD array unit comprises a pair of transparent plate members with a liquid crystal intervened therebetween, and plural pairs of transparent electrode elements arranged on and attached to the transparent plate members in a matrix manner so that the transparent electrode elements in each pair are registered with each other. With the arrangement of the LCD array unit, it is possible to selectively allow penetration of a light beam through each pair of transparent electrode elements by controlling application of a voltage to the electrode elements in pairs. Thus, since each pair of the transparent electrode elements also serves as an optical modulation element, the circuit pattern can be drawn on the workpiece by operating the LCD array unit in accordance with the raster-graphic data read from the bit-map memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the drawing apparatus is provided with a light source device for generating and introducing a light beam into the exposure unit. A suitable lamp, such as a light emitting diode (LED), a high-pressure mercury-vapor lamp, a xenon lamp, a flash lamp and so on, is used in the light source device, according to the sensitivity and the optical characteristics of the photoresist layer on the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Usually, a circuit pattern to be drawn on the workpiece has an area which is considerably larger than an exposure area obtained from an exposure unit or from several exposure units. Thus, it is necessary to scan the workpiece with at least one exposure unit before a large circuit pattern can be completely drawn on the workpiece. To this end, the drawing apparatus is provided with a movable drawing table on which the workpiece is placed. The drawing table is moved relative to the exposure unit, whereby the workpiece on the drawing table is scanned with the exposure unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a &ldquo;step &amp; repeat&rdquo; method is used as a scanning method in the drawing apparatus. In particular, in the &ldquo;step &amp; repeat&rdquo; method, the drawing table is intermittently moved relative to the exposure unit, so that a part of the circuit pattern is drawn on the workpiece by operating the exposure unit based on raster-graphic data during the stoppage of the drawing table, and the intermittent movement of the drawing table is continued until the circuit pattern is completely drawn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> There are various drawbacks in the &ldquo;step &amp; repeat&rdquo; method. First, the drawing speed is slow because of the intermittent movement of the drawing table. Namely, the drawing is not performed during the movement of the drawing table, and therefore the entire drawing time must be calculated as the sum of the movement time of the drawing table and the stoppage time of the drawing table. It is possible to increase the drawing speed, using a high-power light source device, but the high-power light source device is costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Also, the drive mechanism for driving the drawing table is susceptible to damage because acceleration and deceleration of the drawing table must be frequently and repeatedly carried out due to the intermittent movement of the drawing table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the &ldquo;step &amp; repeat&rdquo; method, when any one of the optical modulation elements malfunctions, the optical modulation element concerned produces a pixel defect on the drawn circuit pattern. Accordingly, even if only one of the optical modulation elements malfunctions, it is necessary to exchange the exposure unit with a new exposure unit before a circuit pattern can be drawn without any pixel defect. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a multi-exposure drawing method for drawing a pattern on a surface of a workpiece, using an exposure unit including a plurality of optical modulation elements arranged in a matrix manner, which is constituted so that the various drawbacks involved in the &ldquo;step &amp; repeat&rdquo; method can be completely eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-exposure drawing apparatus in which the aforesaid multi-exposure drawing method is executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multi-exposure drawing method of drawing a pattern on a drawing surface, using an exposure unit including a plurality of optical modulation elements arranged in a matrix manner. In this method, the exposure unit is continuously and relatively moving at a constant velocity with respect to the drawing surface in an array-direction on a matrix-arrangement of the optical modulation elements. Optical modulation elements, which are spaced at a regular interval in an alignment of optical modulation elements along the array-direction, are successively and selectively driven based on a same bit datum to thereby modulate a light beam made incident thereon, whenever the exposure unit is moved by a distance corresponding to the regular interval, resulting in production of a pixel dot on the drawing surface in a multi-exposure manner by the successively-modulated light beams. An exposure time for producing the pixel dot by each of the successively-modulated light beams is smaller than a time when the exposure unit is moved by a distance corresponding to a size of the pixel dot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the distance corresponding to the regular interval may be equivalent to an integer-multiple of the size of the pixel dot. Also, preferably a number of exposure times for producing the pixel dot on the drawing surface by the successively-modulated light beams is equivalent to a quotient which is obtained by dividing a length of the alignment of optical modulation elements by the distance corresponding to the regular interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multi-exposure drawing apparatus that draws a pattern on a drawing surface, using an exposure unit including a plurality of optical modulation elements arranged in a matrix manner. In this apparatus, a movement system continuously and relatively moves the exposure unit at a constant velocity with respect to the drawing surface in an array-direction on a matrix-arrangement of the optical modulation elements. A modulation system successively and selectively drives optical modulation elements, which are spaced at a regular interval in an alignment of optical modulation elements along the array-direction, based on a same bit datum to thereby modulate a light beam made incident thereon, whenever the exposure unit is moved by a distance corresponding to the regular interval, resulting in production of a pixel dot on the drawing surface in a multi-exposure manner by the successively-modulated light beams. A control system controls the movement system and the modulation system so that an exposure time for producing the pixel dot by each of the successively-modulated light beams becomes smaller than a time when the exposure unit is moved by a distance corresponding to a size of the pixel dot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The modulation system may include an optical focussing system that forms the pixel dot on the drawing surface with the modulated light beam at a size the same as that of a corresponding optical modulation element, whereby the distance corresponding to the regular interval is equivalent to an integer-multiple of the size of the pixel dot. Also, due to the existence of the optical focussing system, the number of exposure times for producing the pixel dot on the drawing surface by the successively-modulated light beams is equivalent to a quotient which is obtained by dividing a length of the alignment of optical modulation elements by the distance corresponding to the regular interval.</paragraph>

The light beam, emitted from the optical fiber cable <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is first spread by the convex lens <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, and the spread light is then shaped as a parallel light beam LB by collimating lens <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B, so that the reflecting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of each DMD unit (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>; <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>) is uniformly illuminated with the parallel light beam LB.

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> When the drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> reaches the Y-axis of the coordinate system, first, the selective operation of the micro-mirror elements, included in the first array of the DMD units <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, is started, and then the selective operation of the micro-mirror elements, included in the second array of DMD units <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>, is started after the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved by a distance &ldquo;S&rdquo; between the leading edges of the eight full exposure zones Z<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to Z<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>and the leading edges of the seven full exposure zones Z<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to Z<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>).

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the multi-exposure drawing apparatus is characterized in that the micro-mirror elements are selectively driven in accordance with circuit pattern data (raster-graphic data) while continuously moving the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with respect to the DMD units <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>during a drawing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A principle of the present invention for drawing a circuit pattern on the continuously-moving drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> First, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, it will be explained how one-pixel dot is defined on the continuously-moving drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by a light beam LB<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>reflected from a micro-mirror element which is moved to the exposure position. As stated above, by driving a micro-mirror element from the non-exposure position to the exposure position, an exposure zone is produced on the continuously-moving drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown by the hatched area in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The exposure zone has a C&times;C size, and this size is the same as that of the micro-mirror element, because of the magnifying power of &ldquo;1&rdquo; of the focussing lens system <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Namely, the dimension &ldquo;C&rdquo; is equivalent to 20 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When the drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved by a distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; smaller than the dimension &ldquo;C&equals;20 &mgr;m&rdquo;, the exposure operation is stopped, i.e. the micro-mirror element is returned from the exposure position to the non-exposure position. Thus, an exposure time is defined as the time when the drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved by the distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; (d&lt;C). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> While the drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved by the distance &ldquo;d&rdquo;, the exposure zone (hatching area) is also shifted on the drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by the same distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; in the plus direction of the X-axis of the coordinate system, and thus a total exposure extent &ldquo;TE&rdquo; is defined as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (TE&equals;C&plus;d). The total exposure extent &ldquo;TE&rdquo; is featured by a trailing section, a leading section, and a maximum exposure section &ldquo;ME&rdquo; between the trailing and leading sections (TE&equals;C&minus;d). Note, the trailing section is defined as the extent to which the trailing edge of the exposure zone is shifted by the distance &ldquo;d&rdquo;, and the leading section is defined as the extent to which the leading edge of the exposure zone is shifted by the distance &ldquo;d&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring to the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an exposure distribution of the total exposure extent &ldquo;TE&rdquo; is shown when taken along the plus direction of the X-axis of the coordinate system. As is apparent from this graph, in the trailing section, the amount of exposure is gradually increased from a zero exposure level to a maximum exposure level &ldquo;p&rdquo; of the maximum exposure section &ldquo;ME&rdquo;, and, in the leading section, the amount of exposure is gradually decreased from the maximum exposure level &ldquo;p&rdquo; to the zero exposure level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When the exposure distribution is clipped at a half of the maximum exposure level &ldquo;p&rdquo;, an exposure extent C&prime;, having the half exposure level &ldquo;p/2&rdquo;, is defined, and is equivalent to the dimension &ldquo;C&rdquo; (C&prime;&equals;C). Thus, the exposure zone, having the C&prime;&times;C size, is defined as one pixel dot on the drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> part of the circuit pattern data (raster-graphic data), stored and developed in a bit-map memory, is conceptually shown. The circuit pattern data comprises a plurality of lateral bit-data lines, indicated by a line-number &ldquo;N&rdquo;, and each line includes 1280&times;15 bit-data. The lateral bit-data lines correspond to lateral drawing lines to be successively drawn on the drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> along the Y-axis of the coordinate system. Namely, a lateral bit-data line, indicated by a line-number &ldquo;N&rdquo;, corresponds to the number of a lateral drawing line to be drawn on the drawing surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the 1280&times;15 bit-data, included in each lateral bit-data line, are divided into fifteen groups: first, second, third, . . . , thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth groups, and each group includes 1280 bit-data.

In the first exposure operation, the respective 1280 micro-mirror elements, included in the first line of the DMD unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, are operated in accordance with the 1280 bit-data &lsqb;11110 . . . 00000&rsqb; included in the first lateral bit-data line &ldquo;N&equals;1&rdquo;.

As mentioned above, although the suitable drive mechanism is located between the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the drive motor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, it is symbolically represented by an arrow-headed broken line AL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the drive motor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> comprises a stepping motor. The stepping motor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is driven by a driver circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which is operated by an X-axis control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. To precisely and accurately control the movement of the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the X-axis control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is connected to an X-position detecting sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> securely attached to the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the X-position detecting sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is associated with an X-linear-scale <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> securely provided on the base structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and arranged along the X-axis of the coordinate system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In particular, for example, the X-position detecting sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a light emitter having a light emitting diode (LED), and a light receiver having a photodiode. On the other hand, the X-linear-scale <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has a plurality of divisions which represent a distance, along which the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved along the X-axis of the coordinate system, and each of the fine divisions of the X-linear-scale <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is formed as a fine reflective area. During the movement of the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, while the light emitter of the sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> emits a light toward the division of the scale <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the light receiver of the sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> receives a light reflected from each division of the scale <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Note, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the reflected light is symbolically represented by an arrow-headed broken line AL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The X-position detecting sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> produces a series of clock pulses based on the received lights, and the clock pulses are output to the X-axis control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which operates the driver circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> based on the clock pulses, whereby a series of drive clock pulses is output from the driver circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to the stepping motor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is possible to control the movement of the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to the precision of the divisions of the X-linear-scale <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the X-axis control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is connected to the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and is thus operated under the control of the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Also, the clock pulses, output from the X-position detecting sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, are fed to the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> via the X-axis control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and thus it is possible for the system control circuit to recognize and monitor the position of the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> during the movement of the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along the X-axis of the coordinate system. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Similar to the case of the calculated result &ldquo;I&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>), when A&equals;4*C, the calculated result &ldquo;J&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>1215</bold></highlight>) is also minus (J&lt;0) until the count value of the counter &ldquo;j&rdquo; reaches &ldquo;256&rdquo;, because each DMD unit (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>) included in the first array is identical to each DMD unit (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>) included in the second array.

Then, at step <highlight><bold>1228</bold></highlight>, it is monitored whether the drawing table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has returned to the initial or home position.

<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the above, according to the present invention, since the drawing table is continuously moved during the drawing operation, it is possible to efficiently draw a circuit pattern on the workpiece at a high speed. Further even when a low power light source device is used, a circuit pattern can be drawn at a relatively high speed, due to the continuous movement of the drawing table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the present invention, since it is unnecessary to frequently repeat acceleration and deceleration of the drawing table, the drive mechanism for driving the drawing table is not susceptible to damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, although any one of the optical modulation elements of the exposure unit may malfunction, it is possible to properly carry out the drawing operation without exchanging the exposure unit for a new one, because an exposure zone or pixel dot is produced on the drawing surface in the multi-exposure manner, using a plurality of different modulation elements or micro-mirror elements. Also, although light beams reflected from the different modulation elements or micro-mirror elements have somewhat uneven intensities, it is possible to draw a circuit pattern on the drawing surface at a uniform exposure level, for the same reasons as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Finally, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description is of a preferred embodiment of the system, and that various changes and modifications may be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. </paragraph>
