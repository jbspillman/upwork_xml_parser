<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention will be described, by way of example only, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of the strap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with its assembled parts. The boss elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are fixedly attached to the ends of the frame portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Additionally, a connector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with an attachment loop <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is disposed at the head of the strap as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> so as to allow a suspending means to suspend uprightly the electronic device across the user&apos;s chest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows how the boss elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> attached to the frame portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are designed to co-operate with a recess in an electronic device. The bosses <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are aligned with the corresponding recesses <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> housed at the end of the rear cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and, hence, the strap is removably positioned therein as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The frame portion of the strap can be formed from rigid metallic material such as stainless steel, an aluminium alloy or zinc alloy. In the case of a metallic frame portion, forming may be accomplished by drawing processes that are well known in the art. It could also be manufactured from a flexible polymer material such as nylon. Such a flexible frame portion allows with ease the attachment of a connector thereto, thus minimising the stress transmitted to the base of the rear cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Boss elements are formed from light metal/alloy compositions, for example, aluminium alloys or zinc alloys. Alternatively the boss element may be formed from a polymer material such as Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS). A metallic boss element and metallic frame portion are fixedly attached by forging or pressing in a die tool as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. For a stainless steel frame the ends of the frame portion can be forged on to the boss elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> For polymer materials, the boss element is insert moulded to the end of the frame portion by disposing it in the tool, and once the latter is closed the polymer material is injected around the end of the chord to form the boss element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The internal circuitry of the electronic device is encapsulated within an exterior casing, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, comprising a front cover <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a rear cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a battery cover <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> the rims of which co-operate to secure and contain the electronic device&apos;s internal components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the current embodiment, the end <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the rear cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, comprises two recesses <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on either end thereof for receiving corresponding boss members, and said recesses comprise slits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for guiding into the recess <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> the frame portions adjacent <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> the corresponding boss element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The recess <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is sized and shaped so as to receive the boss element without incurring damage to the co-operating parts such as to the rear cover <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the lower end <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the boss element is substantially spherical, which facilitates co-operation of the boss element with the recesses housed in the rear cover. A flat upper face <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the boss ensures comfortable co-operation therof with the battery cover when concealing the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Once the boss elements of the strap are inserted into the corresponding recesses, the battery cover can be attached to the rear case of the radio handset as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This secures the strap to the lower portion of the handset shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> which can now hang inverted across the user&apos;s chest allowing readable access of the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In addition, if the strap is not attached to the radiotelephone, the recesses housed in the rear cover are concealed by disposing the battery cover thereon, without compromising the aesthetic appeal of the rear cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that many modifications may be made to the embodiment herein before described. For example, the strap may comprise one or more boss elements for disposing in one or more recesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the invention can be used in relation to any sort of portable electronic device including a radiotelephone, a personal digital assist and the like. </paragraph>
