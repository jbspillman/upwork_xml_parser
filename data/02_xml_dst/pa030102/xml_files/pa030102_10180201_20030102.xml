<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to methods for fabricating a semiconductor device, and in particular to a technology for preventing dishing of a dielectric film which serves as an insulating film in a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process of a conductive layer for a contact plug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A conventional CMP process isolates a plug by using a basic slurry. A nitride film is typically used as a hard mask layer of a word line, and an oxide film is typically used as a planarization and gap fill material. In a polishing process of a plug material, the plug material and the oxide film are dished more than the nitride film due to differences in an etching selectivity ratio of the three materials. It is thus necessary to deposit additional oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When CMP process residues fall into the dished region of the plug material and the oxide film, the residues may not be removed in a succeeding cleaning process. As a result, a bridge may be generated between a bit line contact plug and a storage electrode contact plug. Such a bridge undesirably reduces device yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are diagrams for explaining disadvantages of a conventional method for fabricating a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> word line is formed having a mask insulating film pattern composed of a nitride film at its upper portion, and a nitride film spacer at its side walls. An interlayer insulating film composed of BPSG is formed to planarize the upper portion of the resultant structure. A storage electrode contact hole and a bit line contact hole are formed by etching the interlayer insulating film in a self aligned type according to a photolithography process using an exposure mask for forming the storage electrode contact hole and the bit line contact hole. A conductive layer is formed over the resultant structure, filling up the contact holes. The conductive layer is etched to expose the interlayer insulating film, and a contact plug is formed by performing the CMP process until the mask insulating film is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Here, the CMP process is performed by using differences in an etching selectivity ratio of the nitride film, which is the mask insulating film, the BPSG, which is the silicon oxide film, and the conductive layer for the contact plug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, (a) denotes dished regions of the conductive layer for the contact plug due to over-etching in the CMP process.

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As described above, the conventional method for fabricating semiconductor devices has a disadvantage in that a property and yield of the device are deteriorated due to dishing effects. </paragraph>

A storage electrode contact hole and a bit line contact hole are formed to expose the semiconductor substrate by etching the interlayer insulating film and the oxide film according to a photolithography process using a contact mask. The method further includes forming a contact plug consisting of silicon to fill the contact holes, performing a first CMP process using a basic slurry to etch the contact plug and the interlayer insulating film by a predetermined thickness, and performing a second CMP process using an acid slurry to etch the contact plug and the interlayer insulating film, thereby exposing the mask insulating film pattern. </paragraph>

A conductive layer for a gate electrode is formed on the gate oxide film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the conductive layer for the gate electrode has a stacked structure comprising a doped polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a tungsten silicide layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A mask insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed on the conductive layer for the gate electrode. In one embodiment, the mask insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is composed of a nitride film, although other compositions of film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are within the scope of the present invention. Thereafter, a gate electrode having a stacked structure of the mask insulating film pattern and the conductive patterns <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for the gate electrode is formed in accordance with a photolithography process using a gate electrode mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an antireflection film (not shown) composed of a silicon oxide nitride film (SiON) can be formed on the mask insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the antireflection film can be formed as an organic bottom antireflection film at the lower portion of the gate electrode (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An insulating film spacer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed at side walls of the gate electrode, which again may comprise conductive pattern(s) <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. A high temperature oxide (HTO) layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is formed over the resultant structure, and an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> consisting of an oxide film is formed to planarize the upper surface of the resultant structure (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

In one embodiment, the first CMP process is carried out by using a basic slurry of pH 6&tilde;12 having a higher etching speed to a silicon layer and an oxide film than to a nitride film (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a second CMP process is performed on the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the conductive layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for the contact plug to expose the mask insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a contact plug <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed from conductive layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>.
