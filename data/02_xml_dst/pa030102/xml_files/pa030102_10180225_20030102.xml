<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention generally relates to semiconductor processing. More particularly, the invention relates to metallization of sub-micron interconnect features on a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Copper has become a choice metal for filling sub-micron, high aspect ratio interconnect features on substrates as circuit densities increase for the next generation of ultra large scale integration because copper and copper alloys have lower resistivity than aluminum and significantly higher electromigration resistance as compared to aluminum. These characteristics are important for supporting the higher current densities experienced at high levels of integration and increased device speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The aspect ratios for the features, i.e., the ratio for the feature height to the feature width, increases with the higher level of integration. Many traditional deposition processes have difficulty filling structures or features having sub-micron width where the aspect ratio exceeds 4:1, and particularly where the ratio exceeds 10:1. Thus, there is a great amount of ongoing effort being directed at the formation of void-free sub-micron features having high aspect ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Despite the desirability of using copper for semiconductor device fabrication, choices of fabrication methods for depositing copper into very high aspect ratio features are limited because common chemical vapor deposition processes and physical vapor deposition processes have provided unsatisfactory results in forming void-free sub-micron features having high aspect ratios. Furthermore, the vapor deposition processes can be costly. As a result, electroplating or electrochemical deposition is becoming an accepted method for copper metallization of interconnect features on semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Metal electroplating in general is a well known art and can be achieved by a variety of techniques. Present designs of cells for electroplating a metal onto a substrate are generally based on a fountain plater configuration. In the fountain plater configuration, the semiconductor substrate is positioned above a cylindrical electrolyte container with the plating surface facing an opening of the cylindrical electrolyte container. The electrolyte is pumped to flow upwardly and contact the substrate plating surface. The substrate is electrically biased and connected as the cathode of the plating system, and the surfaces to be plated are electrically connected to the cathode power source to provide the electrical current that induces the metal ions in the plating solution to deposit onto the exposed conductive surface of the substrate. An anode is typically disposed in the electrolyte and electrically biased to attract the negatively charged counterparts of the metal ions in the electrolyte. The fountain plater is generally adequate for electroplating large, low aspect ratio features (i.e., larger than micrometer-sized and lower than 1:1 height to width ratio). However, a number of obstacles impair consistent electroplating of copper onto substrates having sub-micron high aspect ratio features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> First, a continuous metal seed layer is essential for conducting the current required to the surfaces to be plated by the electroplating process. When a discontinuity is present in the metal seed layer, the portion of the seed layer that is not electrically connected to the bias power supply does not receive deposition during the electroplating process. Currently practiced physical vapor deposition methods encounters difficulty in forming a continuous, uniform seed layer within a sub-micron high aspect ratio feature. The seed layer tends to become discontinuous on the sidewall surfaces and the bottom surface of the feature because of the difficulty in depositing into the narrow (i.e., nanometer-sized) aperture width of the feature. The discontinuities in the seed layer prevent proper electroplating of metal onto the seed layer, resulting in defective devices on the processed substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Second, it has been difficult to deposit into sub-micron high aspect ratio features without forming voids in the feature because the horizontal electroplated metal growth tends to close off the feature at the aperture opening before the feature has been completely filled, resulting in a void forming within the feature. A void formation in the feature changes the material and operating characteristics of the interconnect feature, such as decreasing electromigration resistance, and typically causes improper operation and premature breakdown of the device. To reduce void formation in a high aspect ratio feature, the upper corners at the feature opening are typically rounded off by an etching process. However, the additional etching step to round-off corners of features increases the processing time for each substrate and reduces throughput of the system. Furthermore, voids may still form within the features during the deposition process even with rounded corners at the feature opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Third, currently practiced electroplating methods have not provided consistent electroplating results between sequentially processed substrate in a single run. Also, the material properties of the electroplated metal layer, such as grain size, orientation, reflectivity and resistance, are not sufficiently uniform across the deposited substrate surface of a single substrate when processed with typical electroplating systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for a consistent metal electroplating technique to form void-less metal interconnects in sub-micron high aspect ratio features on semiconductor substrates. Particularly, there is a need for a method for preparing a substrate prior to electroplating that overcomes the problems presented by currently practiced seed layers used in electroplating and reduces the formation of defective devices. There is also a need for a method for electroplating a metal into sub-micron high aspect ratio feature that provides consistent electroplating results between sequentially processed substrate and uniform material properties of the electroplated metal layer across the deposited substrate surface on a single substrate. </paragraph>

The wafer holder assembly <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> includes a bladder assembly for holding a wafer and a cathode contact ring for providing electrical contact to a seed layer on a wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The rotation of the wafer during the electroplating process may enhance the deposition results. However, rotation of the head assembly may not be necessary to achieve uniform electroplating deposition, particularly where the uniformity of electroplating deposition is achieved by adjusting the processing parameters, such as the electrolyte chemistry, electrolyte flow and other parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The head assembly may also be rotated as the head assembly is lowered to position the wafer in contact with the electrolyte in the process cell as well as when the head assembly is raised to remove the wafer from the electrolyte in the process cell. The head assembly may be rotated at a high speed (i.e., &gt;20 rpm) after the head assembly is lifted from the process cell to enhance removal of residual electrolyte on the head assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The wafer holder assembly <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> generally comprises a wafer holder <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> and a cathode contact ring <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>. In general, the contact ring <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> comprises an annular body having a plurality of conducting members disposed thereon. The annular body is constructed of an insulating material to electrically isolate the plurality of conducting members. Together the body and conducting members form a diametrically interior substrate seating surface which, during processing, supports a substrate and provides a current thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a partial cross sectional view of one embodiment of a wafer holder assembly. The wafer holder assembly <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> includes a wafer holder <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> which secures a substrate in contact with the contact ring <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>. The contact ring <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> includes an annular body portion <highlight><bold>819</bold></highlight> and a contact portion <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight> extending from the body portion <highlight><bold>819</bold></highlight> to provide electrical contact with a seed layer on a substrate plating surface <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight>. The wafer holder <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> includes a bladder assembly <highlight><bold>870</bold></highlight> having an inflatable bladder <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight> attached to a back surface of an intermediary wafer holder plate <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, a portion of the inflatable bladder <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight> is sealingly attached to the back surface <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> of the intermediary wafer holder plate <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> using an adhesive or other bonding material. The front surface <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> of the intermediary wafer holder plate <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive a wafer or substrate <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight> to be processed, and an elastomeric o-ring <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> is disposed in an annular groove <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> on the front surface <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> of the intermediary wafer holder plate <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> to contact a peripheral portion of the wafer back surface. The elastomeric o-ring <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> provides a seal between the wafer back surface and the front surface of the intermediary wafer holder plate <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. The intermediary wafer holder plate <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of bores or holes <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> extending through the plate that are in fluid communication with a vacuum port to facilitate securing the wafer on the wafer holder using a vacuum force applied to the backside of the wafer. The inflatable bladder does not directly contact a wafer being processed, and thus the risk of cutting or damaging the inflatable bladder during wafer transfers is significantly reduced. The elastomeric O-ring <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> is preferably coated or treated to provide a hydrophilic surface (as discussed above for the surfaces of the cathode contact ring) for contacting the wafer, and the elastomeric O-ring <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> is replaced as needed to ensure proper contact and seal to the wafer. </paragraph>

The electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> provides the electrolyte to the electroplating process cells for the electroplating process. The electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> generally comprises a main electrolyte tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, a dosing module <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>, a filtration module <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>, a chemical analyzer module <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>, and an electrolyte waste disposal system <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> connected to the analyzing module <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> by an electrolyte waste drain <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>. One or more controllers control the composition of the electrolyte in the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and the operation of the electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>. The controllers are independently operable but integrated with the control system <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> of the electroplating system platform <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The main electrolyte tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> provides a reservoir for electrolyte and includes an electrolyte supply line <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> that is connected to each of the electroplating process cells through one or more fluid pumps <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> and valves <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>. A heat exchanger <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> or a heater/chiller disposed in thermal connection with the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> controls the temperature of the electrolyte stored in the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. The heat exchanger <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> is connected to and operated by the controller <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The dosing module <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> is connected to the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> by a supply line and includes a plurality of source tanks <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, or feed bottles, a plurality of valves <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight>, and a controller <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>. The source tanks <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> contain the chemicals needed for composing the electrolyte and typically include a deionized water source tank and copper sulfate (CuSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) source tank for composing the electrolyte. Other source tanks <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> may contain hydrogen sulfate (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), hydrogen chloride (HCI) and various additives such as glycol. Each source tank is preferably color coded and fitted with a unique mating outlet connector adapted to connect to a matching inlet connector in the dosing module. By color coding the source tanks and fitting the source tanks with unique connectors, errors caused by human operators when exchanging or replacing the source tanks are significantly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The deionized water source tank preferably also provides deionized water to the system for cleaning the system during maintenance. The valves <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> associated with each source tank <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> regulate the flow of chemicals to the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and may be any of numerous commercially available valves such as butterfly valves, throttle valves and the like. Activation of the valves <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> is accomplished by the controller <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> which is preferably connected to the system control <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> to receive signals therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The electrolyte filtration module <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of filter tanks <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. An electrolyte return line <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> is connected between each of the process cells and one or more filter tanks <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The filter tanks <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> remove the undesired contents in the used electrolyte before returning the electrolyte to the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> for re-use. The main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is also connected to the filter tanks <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> to facilitate re-circulation and filtration of the electrolyte in the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. By re-circulating the electrolyte from the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> through the filter tanks <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, the undesired contents in the electrolyte are continuously removed by the filter tanks <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> to maintain a consistent level of purity. Additionally, re-circulating the electrolyte between the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and the filtration module <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> allows the various chemicals in the electrolyte to be thoroughly mixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> also includes a chemical analyzer module <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> that provides real-time chemical analysis of the chemical composition of the electrolyte. The analyzer module <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> is fluidly coupled to the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> by a sample line <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> and to the waste disposal system <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> by an outlet line <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>. The analyzer module <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> generally comprises at least one analyzer and a controller to operate the analyzer. The number of analyzers required for a particular processing tool depends on the composition of the electrolyte. For example, while a first analyzer may be used to monitor the concentrations of organic substances, a second analyzer is needed for inorganic chemicals. In the specific embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the chemical analyzer module <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> comprises an auto titration analyzer <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> and a cyclic voltametric stripper (CVS) <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight>. Both analyzers are commercially available from various suppliers. An auto titration analyzer which may be used to advantage is available from Parker Systems and a cyclic voltametric stripper is available from ECI. The auto titration analyzer <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> determines the concentrations of inorganic substances such as copper chloride and acid. The CVS <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> determines the concentrations of organic substances such as the various additives which may be used in the electrolyte and by-products resulting from the processing which are returned to the main tank <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> from the process cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The analyzer module shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is merely illustrative. In another embodiment, each analyzer may be coupled to the main electrolyte tank by a separate supply line and be operated by separate controllers. Persons skilled in the art will recognize other embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In operation, a sample of electrolyte is flowed to the analyzer module <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> via the sample line <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>. Although the sample may be taken periodically, preferably a continuous flow of electrolyte is maintained to the analyzer module <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>. A portion of the sample is delivered to the auto titration analyzer <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> and a portion is delivered to the CVS <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> for the appropriate analysis. The controller <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> initiates command signals to operate the analyzers <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> in order to generate data. The information from the chemical analyzers <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> is then communicated to the control system <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>. The control system <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> processes the information and transmits signals which include user-defined chemical dosage parameters to the dosing controller <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>. The received information is used to provide real-time adjustments to the source chemical replenishment rates by operating one or more of the valves <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> thereby maintaining a desired, and preferably constant, chemical composition of the electrolyte throughout the electroplating process. The waste electrolyte from the analyzer module is then flowed to the waste disposal system <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> via the outlet line <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Although a preferred embodiment utilizes real-time monitoring and adjustments of the electrolyte, various alternatives may be employed according to the present invention. For example, the dosing module <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> may be controlled manually by an operator observing the output values provided by the chemical analyzer module <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>. The system software may allow for both an automatic real-time adjustment mode as well as an operator (manual) mode. Further, although multiple controllers are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> single controller may be used to operate various components of the system such as the chemical analyzer module <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>, the dosing module <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>, and the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>. Other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> also includes an electrolyte waste drain <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> connected to an electrolyte waste disposal system <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> for safe disposal of used electrolytes, chemicals and other fluids used in the electroplating system. The electroplating cells may include a direct line connection to the electrolyte waste drain <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> or the electrolyte waste disposal system <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> to drain the electroplating cells without returning the electrolyte through the electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>. The electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> may also includes a bleed off connection to bleed off excess electrolyte to the electrolyte waste drain <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may also include one or more degasser modules <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> adapted to remove undesirable gases from the electrolyte. The degasser module generally comprises a membrane that separates gases from the fluid passing through the degasser module and a vacuum system for removing the released gases. The degasser modules <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> may be placed in line on the electrolyte supply line <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> adjacent to the process cells <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. The degasser modules <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> may be positioned as close as possible to the process cells <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> so that most of the gases from the electrolyte replenishing system are removed by the degasser modules before the electrolyte enters the process cells. In one embodiment, each degasser module <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> includes two outlets to supply degassed electrolyte to the two process cells <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> of each processing station <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a degasser module <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> is provided for each process cell. The degasser modules can be placed at many other alternative positions. For example, the degasser module can be placed at other positions in the electrolyte replenishing system, such as along with the filter section or in a closed-loop system with the main tank or with the processing cell. As another example, one degasser module is placed in line with the electrolyte supply line <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> to provide degassed electrolyte to all of the process cells <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> of the electrochemical deposition system. Additionally, a separate degasser module is positioned in-line or in a closed-loop with the deionized water supply line and is dedicated for removing oxygen from the deionized water source. Because deionized water is used to rinse the processed substrates, free oxygen gases are preferable removed from the deionized water before reaching the SRD modules so that the electroplated copper is less likely to become oxidized by the rinsing process. Degasser modules are well known in the art and commercial embodiments are generally available and adaptable for use in a variety of applications. Commercially available degasser modules are available from Millipore Corporation, located in Bedford, Mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> may include a number of other components. For example, the electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> preferably also includes one or more additional tanks for storage of chemicals for a wafer cleaning system, such as the SRD station. Double-contained piping for hazardous material connections may also be employed to provide safe transport of the chemicals throughout the system. Optionally, the electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> includes connections to additional or external electrolyte processing system to provide additional electrolyte supplies to the electroplating system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the electroplating system platform <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> includes a control system <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> that controls the functions of each component of the platform. The control system <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> may be mounted above the mainframe <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> and comprises a programmable microprocessor. The programmable microprocessor is typically programmed using a software designed specifically for controlling all components of the electroplating system platform <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The control system <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> also provides electrical power to the components of the system and includes a control panel that allows an operator to monitor and operate the electroplating system platform <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The control panel may be a stand-alone module that is connected to the control system <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> through a cable and provides easy access to an operator. Generally, the control system <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> coordinates the operations of the loading station <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, the SRD station <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, the mainframe <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> and the processing stations <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the control system <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> coordinates with the controller of the electrolyte replenishing system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> to provide the electrolyte for the electroplating process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of a typical wafer electroplating process sequence through the electroplating system platform <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A wafer cassette containing a plurality of wafers is loaded into the wafer cassette receiving areas <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> in the loading station <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> of the electroplating system platform <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. A loading station transfer robot <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> picks up a wafer from a wafer slot in the wafer cassette and places the wafer in the wafer orientor <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. The wafer orientor <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> determines and orients the wafer to a desired orientation for processing through the system. The loading station transfer robot <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> then transfers the oriented wafer from the wafer orientor <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> and positions the wafer in one of the wafer slots in the wafer pass-through cassette <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> in the SRD station <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. The mainframe transfer robot <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> picks up the wafer from the wafer pass-through cassette <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> and positions the wafer for transfer by the flipper robot <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight>. The flipper robot <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight> rotates its robot blade below the wafer and picks up wafer from mainframe transfer robot blade. The vacuum suction gripper on the flipper robot blade secures the wafer on the flipper robot blade, and the flipper robot flips the wafer from a face up position to a face down position. The flipper robot <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight> rotates and positions the wafer face down in the wafer holder assembly <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. The wafer is positioned below the wafer holder <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight> but above the cathode contact ring <highlight><bold>766</bold></highlight>. The flipper robot <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight> then releases the wafer to position the wafer into the cathode contact ring <highlight><bold>766</bold></highlight>. The wafer holder <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight> moves toward the wafer and the vacuum chuck secures the wafer on the wafer holder <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight>. The bladder assembly <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> on the wafer holder assembly <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> exerts pressure against the wafer backside to ensure electrical contact between the wafer plating surface and the cathode contact ring <highlight><bold>766</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The head assembly <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> is lowered to a processing position above the process kit <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. At this position the wafer is below the upper plane of the weir <highlight><bold>778</bold></highlight> and contacts the electrolyte contained in the process kit <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. The power supply is activated to supply electrical power (i.e., voltage and current) to the cathode and the anode to enable the electroplating process. The electrolyte is typically continually pumped into the process kit during the electroplating process. The electrical power supplied to the cathode and the anode and the flow of the electrolyte are controlled by the control system <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> to achieve the desired electroplating results. The head assembly may be rotated as the head assembly is lowered into contact with the electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the electroplating process may be performed utilizing an electroplating cell containing a highly resistive electrolyte. For copper metallization, the electrolyte may comprise CuSO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>having a molar concentration between about 0.5M and about 1.1M, HCl at a concentration between about 10 ppm and about 1000 ppm, a carrier additive at a concentration between about 5 ml/l and about 40 ml/l, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having a concentration less than about 0.4 percent. The metallization or filling of the feature is accomplished by applying a first power density to the plating surface (i.e., seed layer) at about 1 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 10 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for about 10 seconds to about 30 seconds followed by a second power density at about 10 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and about 80 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for about 60 seconds to about 120 seconds. The electrolyte is flowed at between 2 gpm and about 4.5 gpm during the electroplating process. No substrate rotation is required to achieve uniform deposition results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> After the electroplating process is completed, the head assembly <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> raises the wafer holder assembly and removes the wafer from the electrolyte. The head assembly may be rotated for a period of time to enhance removal of residual electrolyte from the wafer holder assembly. The vacuum chuck and the bladder assembly of the wafer holder then release the wafer from the wafer holder, and the wafer holder is raised to allow the flipper robot blade to pick up the processed wafer from the cathode contact ring. The flipper robot rotates the flipper robot blade above the backside of the processed wafer in the cathode contact ring and picks up the wafer using the vacuum suction gripper on the flipper robot blade. The flipper robot rotates the flipper robot blade with the wafer out of the wafer holder assembly, flips the wafer from a face-down position to a face-up position, and positions the wafer on the mainframe transfer robot blade. The mainframe transfer robot then transfers and positions the processed wafer above the SRD module <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight>. The SRD wafer support lifts the wafer, and the mainframe transfer robot blade retracts away from the SRD module <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight>. The wafer is cleaned in the SRD module using deionized water or a combination of deionized water and a cleaning fluid as described in detail above. The wafer is then positioned for transfer out of the SRD module. The loading station transfer robot <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> picks up the wafer from the SRD module <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> and transfers the processed wafer into the wafer cassette. Alternatively, the processed wafer may be transferred into the RTA chamber <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> for an anneal treatment process to enhance the properties of the deposited materials. The annealed wafer is then transferred out of the RTA chamber <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> by the loading station robot <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> and placed back into the wafer cassette for removal from the electroplating system. The above-described sequence can be carried out for a plurality of wafers substantially simultaneously in the electroplating system platform <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method for filling sub-micron features on a substrate comprising reactive pre-cleaning the substrate; depositing a barrier layer on the substrate using high density plasma physical vapor deposition; depositing a seed layer over the barrier layer using high density plasma physical vapor deposition; and electro-chemically depositing a metal using a highly resistive electrolyte and applying a first current density during a first deposition period followed by a second current density during a second period. The steps of depositing the barrier layer and depositing the seed layer are performed in a high density plasma chamber, and the electroplating process is performed in an electroplating cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> To begin the pre-clean process, a substrate having sub-micron, high aspect ratio interconnect features is transferred into a pre-clean chamber. A pre-clean gas mixture comprising about 5% hydrogen and about 95% helium is introduced into the chamber, and the chamber pressure is maintained at about 80 mTorr. The RF power provided to the coil is at about 450 W at 2.0 MHz, and the substrate support is biased at about 40 W. The reactive pre-clean process is carried out for about 60 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The substrate is transferred into an HDP-PVD chamber configured to deposit a barrier layer, such as a tantalum barrier layer. A process gas for the plasma sputtering process, such as argon, is flowed into the chamber, and the chamber pressure is maintained at about 20 mTorr. The target is biased at about 1 kW DC, and the coil of the HDP-PVD chamber is biased with an RF power at about 2 kW. The substrate support is biased at about 350 W at 13.56 MHz with about a 50% duty cycle. For a feature having less than about 0.35 &mgr;m opening width and &gt;4:1 height:width aspect ratio, the barrier layer deposition process is carried out for about 18 seconds to deposit a barrier layer having about 150 &angst; film thickness on the surfaces of the interconnect feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The substrate is then transferred into another HDP-PVD chamber configured to deposit a seed layer, such as a copper seed layer. A process gas for the plasma sputtering process, such as argon, is flowed into the chamber, and the chamber pressure is maintained at about 40 mTorr. The chamber conditions are stabilized for about 60 seconds. To begin deposition, the target is biased at about 1 kW DC, and the coil of the HDP-PVD chamber is biased with an RF power at about 3 kW. The substrate support is biased at about 350 W at 13.56 MHz with about a 50% duty cycle. The temperature of the substrate support is maintained at about 30&deg; C. For a feature having less than about 0.35 &mgr;m opening width and &gt;4:1 height:width aspect ratio, the seed layer deposition process is carried out for about 25 seconds to deposit a seed layer having about 1000 &angst; film thickness on the surfaces of the interconnect feature over the barrier layer. The deposition is paused for about 60 seconds with the bias power temporarily discontinued to the target and the coil. Deposition is resumed after the 60 seconds cooldown period. The seed layer deposition process is continued for about 25 additional seconds to deposit another layer of seed layer having about 1000 &angst; film thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The substrate is then transferred to an electrochemical deposition system, and the interconnect features on the substrate are filled using an electrochemical deposition or electroplating cell containing a highly resistive electrolyte. For copper metallization, the electrolyte comprises CuSO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>having a molar concentration between about 0.5M and about 1.1M, HCl at a concentration between about 50 ppm and about 100 ppm, a carrier additive at a concentration between about 12.5 ml/l and about 20 ml/l, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>having a concentration less than about 0.2 percent. The metallization or filling of the feature is accomplished by applying a first power density to the plating surface (i.e., seed layer) at about 2 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for about 18 seconds followed by a second power density at about 40 mA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for about 90 seconds. The electrolyte is flowed at between 2 gpm and about 4.5 gpm during the electroplating process. No substrate rotation is required to achieve uniform deposition results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing is directed to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow. </paragraph>
