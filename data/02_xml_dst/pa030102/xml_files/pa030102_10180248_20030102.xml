<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of toys, and, more particularly, a device for carrying toy furniture items. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There has become known in the venue of retail toy sales various types of furniture, such as stuffed arm chairs, sofas, and/or futons, which are appropriately sized for use as furniture for toys, such as stuffed animals, &ldquo;teddy bears&rdquo;, and the like. These items, while being light enough for an adult to carry with one hand, are often possessed of a non-uniform shape and are of sufficient size as to be awkward, if not impossible, to fit into a conventional shopping bag. Thus, there is a need for a temporary carrying device or carrier specifically for carrying such toy furniture items from a retail store to a vehicle or point of use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is also generally considered advantageous if the product carriers can be recycled and/or reused for other purposes before being discarded or recycled. In this instance, because the product which is purchased and carried from the retail store in the subject device is a toy product, it is desirable if the carrying device is also a source of play, especially for a child who receives the product carried home in the new device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A common problem for retailers in providing external packaging for carry-out purposes is that the packages require a significant amount of space for shipping, storage and in store-availability. Of course, if such packaging is also heavy, increased fees will be incurred in shipping of the carriers. Further, it is necessary that very little time be required to ready the package for receipt and carrying of the goods placed therein, so as to not interfere with store operations and require customers to wait for an extended period of time before leaving the store with their new purchases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is among the several objects of the present invention to provide a consumer product carrying device that permits the facile carrying from a retail store of an article of toy furniture, while simultaneously providing a significant amount of visibility of the article being carried in the new device. It is further among the objects of the present invention, having the features mentioned, that the new carrying device be quick to assemble by one person and be adapted for reuse, and/or alternative use as a play area, and further that the device be sufficiently light weight to readily permit carrying by an individual when a toy furniture product is in the carrier. It is also desirable that the new carrying device be formed a material which can be recycled and that the device provide a suitable substrate for addition of written information, such as product and source information, and/or graphic designs, such as advertising graphics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in keeping with the above objects and advantages, the present invention is, briefly, a device for carrying an article of toy furniture. The device includes a base portion and a sling portion which is selectively and releasably interconnectable with the base portion. The base portion and the sling portion when interconnnected provide a simple and convenient carrier for an article of toy furniture resting on the base portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention is also, briefly, a device that provides the dual function of a carrier device for carrying toys and a play set. The device includes a first piece and a second piece, the first piece being a base for the carrier device and a floor area for the play set and the second piece being a sling for the carrier and a background for the playset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinbelow.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Throughout the figures like parts are indicated by like element numbers. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference to the figures, and initially, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally designates a toy furniture carrier having a base portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which preferably can be separated from one another and optionally used, either separably or together for purposes of play. It is to be understood that while carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be modified to be constructed of all one piece, such is not preferred, in view of the various features and advantages discussed herein regarding storage and play functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</cross-reference>, base portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are each formed from flat pieces of semi-rigid, sheet-like material, which is preferably corrugated cardboard. Optionally, other materials, such as plastic or paper board, for example, can be used to form the portions of carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The material selected to form portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> must be sufficiently rigid to support the weight of a piece of toy furniture, such as indicated in phantom at <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and also sufficiently flexible to be capable of repeated bending at the indicated places (discussed hereafter) for assembly and disassembly of carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Each portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has two sides, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively, which are manufactured substantially flat for economy and for convenience of shipping and storage, but which can be bent at predetermined places in order to permit interconnection of portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as will be described further hereafter, for purposes of forming a sling-type package for carrying a piece of toy furniture. Each side surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provides area for graphic designs and/or advertising. In the preferred embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, whimsical decorations are applied to the flat surfaces of portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The graphical elements provide an eye-catching, attractive &ldquo;package&rdquo; for carrying a recently purchased piece of toy furniture from the store, and at the same time provides a method for advertising the store where the toy furniture item was purchased. This is particularly useful as a marketing mechanism when such stores are located within shopping malls, so that other shoppers in the mall are indirectly urged to frequent the same toy store. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The decorative graphic patterns on the flat surfaces of portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provide a further function, which is to create the impression of a play area, in the case of the illustrations shown herein, a play house, when portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are unconnected from one anther and disposed, for example, in the relative positions illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> (graphics omitted for simplicity). For example, the graphic illustrations shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> provide on side <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> a &ldquo;hardwood&rdquo; floor with a rug, and on side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> an alternative &ldquo;linoleum&rdquo; floor, for use in a pretend bathroom. The alternate sides of sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provide other whimsical home elements, such as a roof, bathtub, computer, lamp, bedroom furniture, and so on. Of course the graphic features can vary infinitely, or be omitted altogether without affecting the functional aspects of the carrying device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, base portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably generally rectangular, although other perimeter shapes are conceived which will suffice, an oval for example. Two slots <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are formed longitudinally through the depth of portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, one substantially adjacent and parallel to each long side edge of base portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Slots <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are sufficiently wide and long to receive the depth and widest portion of the width of sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> therethrough, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</cross-reference>, for example. However, slots <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are not so large in any dimension, as to permit significant &ldquo;play&rdquo; between portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Such construction of base portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> permits quick, facile, secure interconnection of the two portions of carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide a resting place for toy furniture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be stored separately in neat stacks in a retail facility or warehouse, and assembled together to form carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> also clearly illustrates two substantially parallel lines of weakness <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, disposed inwardly of the two opposed short ends of base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and substantially perpendicular to slots <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Lines of weakness <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provide bending lines, to permit base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be adapted for better carrying of toy furniture. When a larger piece of toy furniture is carried in device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, lines of weakness <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may not be used. Rather, in that case, the extensions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which extend as selectively movable panels laterally beyond lines <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may remain flat. Alternatively, if base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is bent somewhat along lines <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, extension panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be angled upwardly, as shown, e.g., in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</cross-reference>, in order to provide some degree of physical blockage, thereby enhancing the prevention of slipping of the toy furniture piece off the upwardly facing surface of base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For completeness, it is to be understood, that although device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in the figures for consistency, with surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> facing upwardly, base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably reversible so that either side can be used for carrying, or for play. Similarly, sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be reversed and either side used facing outwardly for either play or carrying purposes. This point is to be borne in mind as the following description of sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is reviewed, as such describes the sling portion from one side, for simplicity and clarity, but of course, the entire portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be flipped over and the procedure for assembly applied to the opposite side of the panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates the preferred form of sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> just as it is manufactured. The sling portion is elongated and flat and provided with multiple transverse lines of weakness to enhance bendability of portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at preselected places along the length of the portion. When bent at the places indicated, with the opposed ends of portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being directed generally toward one another, on the same side <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be interconnected with base portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and with portions of itself, so as to provide a secure, readily assembled carrying device for toy furniture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> More specifically, for purposes of discussion, the side of sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> facing upwardly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> will be referred to as side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. It is to be understood, that in this preferred embodiment, all lines of weakness described are disposed transversely to the longitude of portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Beginning at the left side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a handle, generally designated <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which includes a preferably elongated, transversely disposed tab portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> separated only by a parallel line of weakness <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to an area <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which defines an opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Area <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably separated by two closely spaced parallel lines of weakness <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from another area <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Area <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is substantially the same size and shape as area <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and also defines an opening, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which is in alignment with opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, preferably along the central longitudinal axis of sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are substantially identical in shape and perimeter size, but are disposed, as illustrated, &ldquo;head to head&rdquo;, so that when area <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is folded toward and over area <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, along lines of weakness <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are in overlapping relation to form a hand hold within handle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. If desired, this opening can have an overall logo shape, can have finger cut-outs, or can simply be an oval, or some other conventional shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Area <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of handle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is separated by a line of weakness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from a short panel <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Along the right side of panel <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a line of weakness <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, having a centrally disposed cut-out slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, separates short panel <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> from a long panel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Long panel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is separated by a line of weakness <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> from a short panel <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, which is further separated by another line of weakness <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> from a substantially central long panel <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. At the rightwardly directed end of long panel <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> there is disposed a line of weakness <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which forms the left border of a short panel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. To the right of panel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> a line of weakness <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> separates a long panel <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> from short panel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Long panel <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is similarly separated on the right boundary thereof by a line of weakness <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> from a short panel <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Short panel <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is separated from another, similarly sized and shaped short panel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> by two closely spaced, parallel lines of weakness <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which define a slot <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Slot <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is sufficiently long and wide to receive therethrough the main portions of areas <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, when such areas are folded, one over the other, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. In this manner the carrying handle is formed for use by passage of handle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through slot <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> as shown and described portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> takes on a sling shape for convenient transport of purchase. This is enhanced by introduction of the body of portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, through the two parallel slots <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in base portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as illustrated, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, so that long panel <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is firmly and securely captured between the upper and lower surfaces of base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, to the right of slot <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> there is illustrated a short panel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which is separated from short panel <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> by lines of weakness <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and slot <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. To the fight of short panel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> terminates in a tab <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which extends from the final panel, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and is separated by a line of weakness <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Tab <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is preferably notched as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, or otherwise suitably shaped to interengage slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, as illustrated, for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Accordingly when structured and assembled as shown and described, carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides and neat, attractive and handy exterior package for transport of a piece of toy furniture. Once the purchaser&apos;s destination has been reached, simple disassembly of the two portions of carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and set up, for example as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> (portions deleted for simplicity) provides an interesting and attractive play area for a child, with stuffed animals or other toys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that some variations in the construction described herein are conceived that will be within the scope of the invention, although the embodiment shown and described above is preferred. For example, the large and short panels of sling portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, can, if desired, be further subdivided by more transverse lines of weakness. In this manner, more options are available for bending sling portion to fit around toy furniture of different sizes and shapes, and more options are available for use of the new carrier as a play set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, it will be seen that the several objects of the invention are achieved and other advantages are attained. Although the foregoing includes a description of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention, various modifications are conceivable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As various modifications could be made in the constructions herein described and illustrated without departing from the scope of the invention it is intended that all matter contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative rather than limiting. </paragraph>
