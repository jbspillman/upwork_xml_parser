<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a dielectric duplexer mainly used in RF circuits for mobile communication and to a communication device having the dielectric duplexer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typically, a communication device having a dielectric duplexer is configured with elements as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a communication device of the related art, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> is a block diagram of another communication device of the related art in which matching circuits are inserted. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference>, reference symbol DPX indicates a duplexer, ANT is an antenna, PA is a power amplifier, and LNA is a low-noise amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, an impedance system in a transmission line for a radio frequency signal is set to 50 &OHgr; as a reference. Thus, a dielectric duplexer is also commonly configured so as to match with such a reference impedance system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, in a typical portable communication device, in many cases, the power amplifier PA is connected to a TX terminal of the dielectric duplexer DPX, the antenna ANT is connected to an ANT terminal, and the low-noise amplifier LNA is connected to an RX terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A signal amplified by the power amplifier PA is sent to the antenna ANT through the dielectric duplexer DPX, and is sent out from the antenna ANT. A signal received by the antenna ANT is sent to the low-noise amplifier LNA through the duplexer DPX, amplified, and then sent to a circuit at a subsequent stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, such a dielectric duplexer of the related art and such a communication device having the dielectric duplexer exhibit the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An element connected to a duplexer for use in a communication device does not necessarily have an impedance of 50 &OHgr;, and often has an impedance that deviates therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Since a portable communication device uses a battery as its power supply, a power amplifier PA provided in the portable communication device and connected to the input terminal (TX terminal) of a duplexer is set to have a low power-supply voltage, which is generally about 3 to 6 V. Thus, for increasing an output to be transmitted from the antenna, the output impedance must be set low. For example, the output impedance required for providing a saturation power of about 2 W is about 2 to 6 &OHgr;. However, when a power amplifier PA having an output impedance of 2 to 6 &OHgr; is directly connected to the duplexer, since the input impedance of the duplexer is 50 &OHgr;, no impedance matching is achieved, resulting in the generation of loss due to signal return. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B, a</cross-reference> matching circuit for performing impedance matching is inserted between the power amplifier PA and the duplexer DPX such that the 2 to 6 &OHgr; transmission system is converted into a 50 &OHgr; transmission system to transmit a signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In addition to loss that resulted from the matching circuit itself, the insertion of the matching circuit causes the generation of other transmission loss between the power amplifier PA and the matching circuit, and between the matching circuit and the duplexer DPX. Furthermore, such an arrangement requires additional space for arranging the matching circuit, thus causing an increase in the size of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The low-noise amplifier LNA connected to the output terminal (RX terminal) of the duplexer DPX typically has an input impedance of about 100 &OHgr;, thus requiring matching with the duplexer DPX. Also in this case, the insertion of a matching circuit causes the generation of various types of loss, such as those described above, making it difficult to achieve low-loss transmission of a signal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a dielectric duplexer that facilitates impedance matching between the duplexer and each circuit element connected thereto without the use of an additional circuit element, and to provide a communication device having the dielectric duplexer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a dielectric duplexer. The dielectric duplexer includes a dielectric block preferably having a substantially rectangular shape. In the dielectric block, a plurality of holes, each having an inner conductor on the inner surface thereof, are provided so as to extend from one surface of the dielectric block to the opposing surface thereof so as to form a plurality of conductive through holes. An antenna excitation hole having an inner-surface electrode is provided so as to extend from one surface of the dielectric block to the opposing surface thereof. The dielectric block has, on the outer surface thereof, an outer conductor, an input terminal, an output terminal, and an antenna terminal. The input terminal, the output terminal, and the antenna terminal are separated from the outer conductor, and the antenna terminal is electrically coupled with the antenna excitation hole. The absolute value of the reflection coefficient of at least one of the input terminal, the output terminal, and the antenna terminal is in the range of about 0.33 to about 1.00 in a passband, with a reference impedance of 50 &OHgr;. This arrangement allows impedance matching with an element to be connected to the dielectric duplexer, and allows low-loss transmission of a signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the input impedance of the input terminal is set to 25 &OHgr; or less. This arrangement allows impedance matching with a low-impedance circuit element at the earlier stage, and allows low-loss input of a signal from the earlier stage without inserting a matching circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the output impedance of the output terminal is set to 100 &OHgr; or more. This arrangement allows impedance matching with a high-impedance circuit element at the subsequent stage, and allows low-loss output of a signal to the subsequent stage without inserting a matching circuit </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the input/output impedance of the antenna terminal is set to either 25 &OHgr; or less or 100 &OHgr; or more. This arrangement allows impedance matching with an antenna, and also allows for a reduction in loss at the time of transmission and an improvement in sensitivity at the time of reception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the dielectric duplexer further includes an excitation hole having an inner-surface electrode that is electrically coupled with the input terminal or the output terminal. The mutual capacitance between the excitation hole and the conductive through hole adjacent thereto is set by adjusting the shape of the excitation hole and the distance between the excitation hole and the conductive through hole adjacent thereto, and the input impedance or the output impedance is set based on the mutual capacitance. This arrangement can facilitate provision of a desired input impedance or output impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the inner conductor of one of the conductive through holes is electrically coupled with the input terminal or the output terminal, and the conductive through hole provides a resonator. The self-capacitance of the resonator is preferably set by adjusting the shape of the conductive through and the distance between the conductive through hole and the outer conductor. The input impedance or the output impedance is set based on the self-capacitance. This arrangement can facilitate provision of a desired input impedance or output impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Capacitive coupling is provided between at least one of the conductive through holes and the input terminal or the output terminal. Preferably, the coupling capacitance therebetween is set by adjusting the shape and the position of the input terminal or the output terminal, and the input impedance or the output impedance is set based on the coupling capacitance. This arrangement can facilitate provision of a desired input impedance or output impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a communication device that includes the dielectric duplexer. This arrangement can facilitate configuration of a low-loss and compact communication device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a graph showing the mutual impedance Zr between the excitation hole and the adjacent resonator versus the input impedance Zin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the input impedance Zfin from the resonator R<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is constant, the input impedance Zin decreases as the mutual impedance Zr decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the input impedance of the transmitting filter in the dielectric duplexer can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Thus, configuring the transmitting filter as described above such that the input impedance becomes 25 &OHgr; or less can provide a reflection coefficient of about &minus;0.33 or less (0.33 or more in absolute value) for the input terminal, with a reference impedance of 50 &OHgr;. This allows low-loss transmission of a signal even when the dielectric duplexer is directly connected to a low output-impedance circuit element, such as a power amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> With regard to the output terminal <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, since the output terminal <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> also serves as the open circuited end of the resonator that is provided by the conductive through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> constituting the receiving filter, the output impedance of the receiving filter directly becomes the output impedance of the output terminal <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an equivalent circuit of the output terminal <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the resonator R<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> provided by the conductive through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that is electrically coupled with the output terminal <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, reference symbol Zout indicates the output impedance of the output terminal <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and Zfout indicates the output impedance of the transmitting filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The output impedance Zfout of the filter is expressed by:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> where Za is the self-impedance of the resonator R<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and Qe is the external Q-factor of the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Thus, increasing the self-impedance Za of the resonator R<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can increase the output impedance of the output terminal <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Increasing the self-capacitance of the resonator R<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can increase the self-impedance Za of the resonator R<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. That is, increasing the distance between the conductive through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the outer conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, or reducing the inner diameter of the conductive through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can increase the self-impedance Za. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> By way of an example, when the filter according to this embodiment is designed to have a bandwidth ratio of 40 and a Q-factor Qe of about 20, the following expression is given:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In general, in a small dielectric filter, since the self-impedance of the resonator is about 5 to 15 &OHgr;, the output impedance Zout becomes about 130 to 380 &OHgr;. In this manner, changing the structure of the resonator that is electrically coupled with the output terminal <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> allows for setting of the output impedance to 100 &OHgr; or more. This can provide a high output-impedance for the transmitting filter in the dielectric duplexer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Thus, configuring the receiving filter as described above such that the output impedance becomes 100 &OHgr; or more can provide a reflection factor of about &plus;0.33 or more for the output terminal, with a reference impedance of 50 &OHgr;. This allows low-loss transmission of a signal even when the dielectric duplexer is directly connected to a high input-impedance circuit element, such as a low-noise amplifier LNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In addition, adjusting the inner diameter of the excitation hole <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, which preferably has a straight-hole structure, allows for setting such that matching is achieved with the input/output impedance of the antenna terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Typically, the characteristic impedance of antennas is set to 50 &OHgr;. In some cases, the impedance may not be the intrinsic impedance of elements that constitute the antennas and may be converted into 50 &OHgr;. However, such impedance conversion into 50 &OHgr; causes generation of loss that is due to a converter circuit. Thus, changing the structures of an antenna terminal and a resonator for coupling therewith can provide a desired input/output impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, a connection can be accomplished with an impedance that can increase the gain of the antenna, which thus can enhance the sending and receiving efficiencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the impedance of a circuit element to be connected to the dielectric duplexer is either 25 &OHgr; or less or 100 &OHgr; or more, varying the shape of the excitation hole or the resonator allows for matching of the input impedance and the output impedance. In other words, varying the configuration of the dielectric duplexer such that the absolute value of the reflection factor falls in the range of about 0.33 to about 1.00 allows for direct and low-loss transmission of a signal to/from a circuit element that is connected prior to/subsequent to the input/output terminal and that has an impedance of either 25 &OHgr; or less or 100 &OHgr; or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The use of this dielectric duplexer allows for configuration of a communication device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, reference symbol DPX is a duplexer, PA is a power amplifier, ANT is an antenna, and LNA is a low-noise amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In this case, the output impedance of the power amplifier PA is 25 &OHgr; or less, the input impedance of the low-noise amplifier LNA is 100 &OHgr; or more, and the input/output impedance of the antenna ANT is 50 &OHgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A signal amplified by the power amplifier PA is converted by the duplexer DPX into a transmission wave having a signal within a frequency band. The transmission wave is then sent to the antenna ANT for transmission. The signal received by the antenna ANT is filtered by the duplexer DPX into a signal within a frequency band required by a circuit at a subsequent stage, and is sent to the low-noise amplifier LNA. The low-noise amplifier LNA amplifies the received wave and sends the resulting signal to a circuit at the subsequent stage. Incorporating the dielectric duplexer of the first embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in such a communication device allows impedance matching between the individual elements without inserting a matching circuit between the power amplifier PA and the dielectric duplexer DPX, and without inserting a matching circuit between the dielectric duplexer DPX and the low-noise amplifier LNA. This can therefore improve the reception sensitivity of a signal. </paragraph>

Thus, the transmitting filter and the receiving filter constitute the dielectric duplexer of the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In this case, increasing the diameter of the excitation hole <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, increasing the longitudinal diameter of the ellipse, or reducing the distance between the excitation hole <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the resonator provided by the conductive through hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can reduce the input-impedance. In addition, reducing the inner diameter of the excitation hole <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which preferably has a straight-hole structure, can increase the output impedance of the output terminal <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

That is, this dielectric duplexer is configured such that a two-stage resonator and a trap resonator constitute a transmitting filter and a three-stage resonator constitutes a receiving filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A, a</cross-reference> coupling capacitance Ce is generated between the output terminal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the resonator R<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> provided by the conductive through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the dielectric duplexer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, Zout is an output impedance when viewed from the output terminal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, Zfout is an output impedance when viewed from the resonator R<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and L is an inductance component of the resonator R<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, in combination with the inductance component L of the resonator R<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the impedance of the coupling capacitance Ce is converted to Ce&prime;. In this case, the relationship of the output impedances Zout and Zfout and the coupling capacitance Ce is expressed by:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Based on this expression, the relationship between the coupling capacitance Ce&prime; and the output impedance Zout is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, varying the coupling capacitance Ce&prime; allows for arbitrary setting of the output impedance Zout. That is, the shape and position of the output terminal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> defines the coupling capacitance Ce between the output terminal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the resonator R<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Thus, the output impedance Zout can be set high so as to match that of a high-impedance circuit element at the subsequent stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In this case, since the output impedance Zout cannot be set greater than the output impedance Zfout, it is adjusted within the range of 0&lt;Zout&lt;Zfout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The excitation hole <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> connected to the input terminal <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is analogous to the excitation hole <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the third embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, therefore, the output impedance of the dielectric duplexer can be set so as to match the impedance of a circuit element connected to the output terminal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, the input impedance and output impedance are adjusted by varying the structure of the input or output terminal or by varying the shape and/or position of the excitation holes or resonators that are in continuity with the terminals. The same approach can be equally applied to the antenna terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> With regard to the input terminal and the output terminal to which description has been separately given in the above embodiments, the configuration thereof may be such that the input terminal and the output terminal are reversed depending upon the impedances of circuit elements to be connected to the corresponding terminals. </paragraph>
