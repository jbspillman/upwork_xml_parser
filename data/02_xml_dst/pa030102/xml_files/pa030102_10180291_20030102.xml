<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a medical energy irradiation apparatus inserting an inserting portion thereof into a cavity or a lumen in a living body, such as a blood vessel, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, abdominal cavity, thoracic cavity, and irradiating tissues of a living body with energy, such as laser light, a microwave, radio frequency, and ultrasonic wave, from an emitting portion provided in the inserting portion to perform a cure for the tissues of a living body including a lesion. Further, it relates to a medical energy irradiation apparatus which permits easy and accurate establishment of a target position to be irradiated with the energy, in heat-curing for only a target depth of the living body, for example, a tumor, such as a cancer, and prostatic hyperplasia. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There is known a medical energy irradiation apparatus which inserts an inserting portion thereof shaped like a longer measure into a living body by using a body cavity or performing small incision, and irradiates the tissue of a living body including a lesion with energy, such as laser light, a microwave, radio frequency, and ultrasonic wave, from this inserting portion, thereby destroying the tissue of the lesion by degeneration, necrosis, coagulation, ablation or vaporization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The medical energy irradiation apparatus is generally for performing a cure by applying direct irradiation with energy to a lesion located on a surface of a tissue of a living body or in the proximity thereof. However, it is also applied to heat-curing for a lesion located in a deep part of a tissue of a living body, such as a prostate gland. Also, there is known a medical energy irradiation apparatus that is configured to be cooled with coolant in the proximity of its energy emitting portion provided in the inserting portion. According to this energy irradiation apparatus, because a tissue of a living body making contact with the energy emitting portion or the neighborhood thereof is cooled in the surface or in the proximity thereof, these parts can be protected from heat-injury and only a deep part of the tissue of a living body can be heated intensively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When, for example, a cure for a prostate gland is performed by using this medical energy irradiation apparatus, generally the following procedures are performed. That is, the doctors performing a cure for a prostate gland first insert the inserting portion of the medical energy irradiation apparatus toward the urinary bladder from the urethra of patients, and make the emitting portion reach to a portion of the urethra enclosed by the prostate gland (prostatic urethra). Then, in that position, the doctors align the position of the emitting portion to the direction of a target site in the urethra, thus performing irradiation with energy. The doctors generally perform this series of operations while they are observing the views of each position in the urethra by an endoscope that can be inserted in the longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To describe one example of the above described alignment of the emitting portion in detail, the doctors first insert a predetermined length of the inserting portion of the medical energy irradiation apparatus from the urethra entrance of the patients, and fix the inserting section and the endoscope at this position, and then observe and store the view of the proximal end portion of the urethra irradiated with energy observed by the endoscope in memory. Next, the doctors further insert the endoscope toward a deeper part in the direction of the urinary bladder of the patients by a predetermined length with the inserting section fixed in the urethra, and fix the endoscope at the position, and then again observe and store the view of the distal end portion of the urethra irradiated with energy therein observed by the endoscope in memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The doctors repeatedly carry out the above described operations of the endoscope while changing the position of the inserting section to be fixed in the urethra, thereby positioning the emitting portion toward a target position, that is, a target position for irradiating a target site with energy. Also, when the doctors judge that the endoscope has been inserted beyond the target position, they return the inserting section toward the urethra entrance and fix it, and the doctors repeatedly carry out the series of operations of the endoscope, as well, to move the inserting section to the target position, and fix if therein. Further, the doctors have determined a position for fixing the point of the inserting section based on a distance from the seminal colliculus in the urethra to be observed by an endoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also, when the doctors perform the heat-curing using the medical energy irradiation apparatus described above at a plurality of positions, they repeatedly perform the above described operations for each of the positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, according to the above described method, the doctors determine an irradiation target position for heat-curing by visual observation while they are moving the endoscope. For this reason, although the doctors can roughly grasp the target position, it has been impossible to determine reliably and accurately the portion for fixing the inserting section thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, in performing heat-curing by the medical energy irradiation apparatus described above, when the doctors place the emitting portion at an appropriate irradiation target position in a urethra surrounded by a prostate gland, they have sometimes placed the emitting portion at a position closer to the urinary bladder beyond the appropriate irradiation target position in the urethra, or sometimes placed it on the side of external urethral sphincter located at the front of the appropriate irradiation target position in the urethra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In this way, when the doctors fail to place the inserting portion of the medical energy irradiation apparatus on an appropriate position of placement, the patients cannot obtain a sufficient heat cure effect or can be damaged in the healthy urinary bladder or external urethral sphincter thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Also, when the heat-curing by the medical energy irradiation apparatus described above is performed a plurality of times, the possibility of error operations as described above further increase, because the doctors must perform the operation of positioning the inserting portion a plurality of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Also, when the heat-curing is performed by using a medical energy irradiation apparatus provided with an emitting portion having a wide range of energy irradiation, it is difficult for the doctors to limit the range of energy irradiation only to the prostate gland of the irradiation target site. For this reason, the doctors must irradiate accurately the central portion of the prostate gland with energy, but the conventional methods of setting an energy irradiation target position rely on the guesswork of the doctors in some part. Therefore, it has been impossible to avoid errors occurring in determination of an irradiation target position. For this reason, because of deviation from an energy irradiation target position, there have been fears that the patients cannot obtain a sufficient effect of curing or can be damaged in the healthy urinary bladder or external urethral sphincter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if the patients feel physical disorder caused by the insertion of the inserting portion into them during heat-curing, searing heat due to heat-curing, and pains, and they move by a reflex action, and even though the doctor realize a deviation in the position of placement, the doctors cannot return the inserting portion to the position of placement prior to the position deviation. As a result, there have been fears that the patients cannot obtain a sufficient effect of curing or can be damaged in the healthy urinary bladder or external urethral sphincter. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in accordance with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> By the way, in the description below, laser light is used as an example of energy used for heat curing of the prostatic hypertropy or the like, but the energy used for the heat curing does not need to be limited to laser light, and, for example, a microwave, radio frequency, ultrasonic wave, or the like may be used instead of laser light. Also, as an example of the application of a medical energy irradiation apparatus according to the present embodiment, its use for heat curing of the prostatic hyperplasia will be described. However, the application of the medical energy irradiation apparatus according to the present embodiment is not limited to heat curing of the prostatic hyperplasia, and can be used for heating curing of tumors such as cancer or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Medical Energy Irradiation Apparatus: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a system block diagram of a medical energy irradiation apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for heat curing of a prostatic hyperplasia according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The medical energy irradiation apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for laser-light irradiation of a sideward-irradiating type, which applicator is inserted into a living body (for example, a urethra <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>), and irradiation with laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> guided from a laser light generating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through an optical fiber <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is performed toward a tissue of a living body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from a housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Further, the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for laser irradiation is provided with a plurality of coolant-circulating lumens (not shown) which communicate with the housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> connected to the tip portion of the applicator. These lumens are connected with a coolant-sending tube <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> and a coolant return tube <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of a coolant-circulating unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The coolant-circulating unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> sends out a coolant at a predetermined flow rate to the laser-light irradiation applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> based on a control signal from a control unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A coolant temperature regulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> performs temperature control of the coolant by heating or cooling it based on a control signal from the control unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A motor <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> rotates in a predetermined number of revolutions based on a control signal from the control unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The control unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises an operation unit (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) as input means, a display unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for displaying input information and apparatus information, a controller (not shown) for controlling each device, a memory unit (not shown) for various information, and an input and output unit (not shown) for various information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> During heat curing of an irradiation target site of a prostate gland (target point) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by a laser beam, a coolant is supplied from the coolant-circulating unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the laser-light irradiation applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the coolant-sending tube <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, and the motor <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> rotates, and the laser-light generating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The generated laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is guided to the front end of the laser-light irradiation applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, reflected by a reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, and passes through a window portion, thus the irradiation target site (target point) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> being irradiated with the laser light. At this time, the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> changes its irradiation angles while performing an reciprocating motion in the axial direction with cycles 2-10 Hz, preferably 3-6 Hz. However, because all the optical paths of the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> cross each other at the irradiation target site (target point) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the prostate gland (target position) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the irradiation target site (target point) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is continuously subjected to irradiation with the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to absorb a large amount of heat, thus heated to a high temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, on the surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the tissue of the living body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (that is, the neighborhood of the surface of the urethra), the positions irradiated with the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, of which irradiation angles is being changed by the axial reciprocating motion of the reflection plane <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, constantly move without being fixed at a position, and therefore generate heat a little to be kept at a relatively low temperature. As a result, the surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (the neighborhood of the surface of the urethra) is protected from the effect of heating by the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Front End of the Applicator: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the front end of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has a front-end housing <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> having a front-observation window <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> smooth and flat, contained in the housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and for reflecting the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, a supporting member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for holding the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, a monorail pipe <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> for making the supporting member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> movable in the longitudinal direction of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, non-parallel grooves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> for varying an angle of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> such that irradiation with the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> reflected by the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> may be always directed toward the same site, and an endoscope <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> for observing the tissues of the living body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is linked with a drive unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) placed at the basal end of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the supporting member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Thus, the reciprocating motion of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by an arrow in the figure is made possible by the movement of the supporting member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The drive unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) has a cam mechanism (not shown) for converting a rotary motion of the motor <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) into a reciprocating motion, and thus allows the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> to reciprocate in the longitudinal direction of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> according to the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is configured by a hard tube-like body having a side-observation window <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Structure of the Reflecting Portion and Support Member: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view for illustrating structures of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and the supporting member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which slide on the monorail pipe <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The supporting member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> supports the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. A support portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is provided on one side of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, and a pair of protrusions <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are provided on the other side. The support portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is to mount the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> such that it can rotate independently of the support member <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and the support portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is adaptable for changes in reflection angle of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. The protrusions <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are fitted with the non-parallel grooves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> arranged on the inner wall of the housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The supporting member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is linked with the drive unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) placed at the basal end of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and slides on the monorail pipe <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> to reciprocate in the longitudinal direction of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For this reason, the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> can vary its angle of inclination with its movement in the axial direction based on the linkage between the supporting member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the non-parallel grooves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Relation Between the Reflecting Portion and Laser Light: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a diagram for illustrating a relation between the movement of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and a direction of irradiation with the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> distance between the supporting member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the non-parallel groove <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> at P<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(position B) is shorter than that at P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>(position C) . For this reason, when the support portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> moves from P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>(position C) to P<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(position B), the protrusions <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> slide along the non-parallel grooves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and thus the angle of inclination of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is adjusted. That is, the angle of inclination of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> with respect to the monorail pipe <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is adjusted to become small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Similarly, when the support portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> moves from P<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(position B) to P<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(position A), the angle of inclination of the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> with respect to the monorail pipe <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is adjusted to become smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in between P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>(position C)&mdash;P<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(position A), the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> reflected by the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is established to be always concentrated on the irradiation target site (target position) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the target prostate gland (target site) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For this reason, only the irradiation target site (target point) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is continuously irradiated with the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, and the other tissues such as those of the surface are intermittently irradiated. Therefore, the irradiation target site <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, continuously irradiated with the laser light, generates a large amount of heat due to the irradiation and thus is heated to a desired high temperature. On the other hand, the positions other than the irradiation target site <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as the surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, intermittently irradiated with the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> generates a small amount of heat due to the irradiation, thereby being little heated. Therefore, while suppressing a rise in temperature at the portion of the surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, it is possible to heat only the irradiation target site <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the neighborhood thereof by the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to a desired temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Further, in the above description, the non-parallel grooves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> have been described as straight lines, but they are not limited to be like straight-lines, and they may be like curved lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Also, the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> for reflecting the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> reciprocates on the monorail pipe <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at a cycle of 2-10 Hz, preferably 3-6 Hz, while varying its angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Herein, the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> for irradiation is preferably divergent light, collimated light, or convergent light. Also, optics for converting the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> into convergent light may be provided at some midpoint in the optical path of the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. In addition, although the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> used is specifically not limited as far as it has in-the-living-body reachability, the laser light preferably has a wavelength of 750-1300 nm or 1600-1800 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> For example, a gas laser such as a He&mdash;Ne laser, a solid laser such as an Nd&mdash;YAG laser, and a semiconductor laser such as a GaAlAs laser are applicable to the laser light generating unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for generating the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> having a wavelength above described. Also, the diameter of the inserting portion of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, or the outer diameter of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, is not specifically limited as far as it can be inserted into a body cavity <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. However, the outer diameter of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferable in the degree of 2-20 mm, more preferably 3-8 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Positioning Marker: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows one example in which positioning markers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are arranged in the interior of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> That is, the positioning markers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are arranged at a front position (M<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), central position (M<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), rear position (M<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) and four positions (m<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, m<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, m<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, m<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) spaced an equal spacing (for example, 3 mm) between the central position (M<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and the rear position (M<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) in the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> for reflecting the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Herein, the front position (M<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) and the rear position (M<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) indicate the limit points of irradiation with the laser light <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> radiated toward tissues of a living body, and the front position (M<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) indicates the limit point of irradiation on the front end side of the inserting portion, and the rear position (M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) indicates the limit point of irradiation on the basal end side of the inserting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Further, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the shape of the markers is shown as lines, but arbitrary shapes (for example, points, triangles, etc.) may be used as far as doctors can identify the shapes by using an endoscope. Also, the color of the markers is not specifically limited, any color may be used as far as doctors can identify the colors by using an endoscope. Each marker may be color coded, including that the markers of the front position (M<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), central position (M<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and rear position (M<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) are changed from one another in color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Also, the number of the markers is not limited to the example described above (seven markers), but arbitrary number of the markers may be established to be arranged. Further, the spacing of markers is not limited to the example described above, but any spacing may be used as far as doctors can identify the spacing by using an endoscope. Preferably the spacing of 1-5 mm, more preferably 2-3 mm, is easy to identify. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Other Positioning Markers: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&rsqb;</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, the direction of irradiation with laser light points downward. For example, when the left lateral lobe of the prostate gland <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is irradiated with laser light, the doctors must change the direction of irradiation with laser light to the direction of the left lateral lobe of the prostate gland <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the doctors rotate the basal end portion <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A, 9B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C) of the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in 90-degree angles up to the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, and then the applicator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> rotates, thus changing the direction of irradiation with laser light to the direction of the left lateral lobe of the prostate gland <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. At this time, because an angle denotation sheet shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is affixed on the endoscope monitor <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>), the scale pointed by the direction marker <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in the angle denotation sheet is changed from 180&deg; to &plus;90&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram for showing one example of tissue sites of a living body observed by the endoscope <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> in the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>B, and this is the same diagram as that obtained at rotating <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> in 90-degree angles. Also, the direction marker <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is observed at &plus;90&deg; position in the angle denotation sheet shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Further, the rotation operation described above is one example, and the operation of rotation to the directions other than &plus;90&deg; is similar to that. Also, the angle denotation sheet shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is one example, the shape of scales may be a &ldquo;point&rdquo;, but not a &ldquo;line&rdquo;. Further, the notation of the scales may be &ldquo;o&apos;clock&rdquo;, but not &ldquo;degree&rdquo;. Furthermore, the color of the scales may be arbitrary as far as they can be distinguished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In addition, although the angle denotation sheet can be made of any material as far as it is transparent, the material is preferably a film material removably attached to the endoscope monitor. Also, the angle denotation does not need to be indicated on a sheet, but it may be on an endoscope monitor having angle denotation provided initially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the operations of FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B, a position to be irradiated with laser light is determined. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Next, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>, an ascertaining operation after determining a position to be irradiated with laser light will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Although the direction of irradiation with laser light has been determined in the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>B, when it is wanted to check the front and back directions of the prostate gland <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with respect to the urethra, the doctors move the endoscope <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> toward the urinary bladder <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram for showing one example of tissue sites of a living body observed by the endoscope <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> in the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference>. Herein, the tissues of a living body observed through the side-observation window <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are observed in the right side part (indicated by a dotted line) of the observed image. Also, the interior <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> of the applicator is observed in the upper, lower and left side parts (displayed by dotted lines) of the observed image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In the interior of the applicator <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, there are observed M<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>located at the front position and M<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>located at the central position among the positioning markers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the area to be irradiated with laser light can be grasped by using the positioning markers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and a position to be irradiated with laser light is finally determined based on the position and conditions or the like of the urethra seen through the side observation window <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The embodiments described above have not been described to limit the invention, but they may be variously changed within the technological principle of the invention. Also, although laser light has been exemplified and described as energy radiated toward tissues of a living body, the invention is not limited to it, and includes, for example, a microwave, radio frequency, ultrasonic wave or the like. Further, the medical energy irradiation apparatus according to the invention is preferably applied to heat curing of only prostate gland as in curing for prostatic diseases, such as the prostatic hypertropy, prostatic cancer, while decreasing damage caused by heating of normal tissues, such as a urethra and rectum, existing in the proximity of the prostate gland. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> As described above, the invention can provide a medical energy irradiation apparatus permitting easy and accurate establishment of a position targeted for irradiation with energy (a site to be irradiated with energy in tissues of a living body), when doctors use the medical energy irradiation apparatus to cure prostatic hypertropy or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the claims. </paragraph>
