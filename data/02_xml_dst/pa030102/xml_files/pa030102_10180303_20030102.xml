<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">For the purpose of repairing supply lines such as a wastewater pipe, a plastic hose has been developed which, in the clear state, has a diameter which is the same size as, or larger than, the diameter of the pipe in which it is to be inserted. This plastic hose is used to fix optical or electric cables against the inner wall of the pipe. For this purpose, the plastic hose is introduced into the waste-water pipe in a collapsed state, together with the cable, and is released when the desired positioning has been reached. The collapsed plastic hose will then regain its original shape and thereby fix the cable against the inner wall of the waste-water pipe. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on a priority application EP01440193.9 which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a device and two methods for fixing an optical or electric cable against the inner wall of a pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The use of waste-water, rain-water or mixed-water conduits or other discharge or supply lines for laying communications cables is one possible way, which has already been used, of reducing underground construction costs for the connection of subscribers (access). In addition, it makes possible to expand such connection of subscribers in a demand-orientated and rapid manner, something which has become increasingly important of late because of the large number of operators. In what follows, the term &ldquo;waste-water conduit&rdquo; (waste-water pipe) is also intended to cover rain-water conduits, mixed-water conduits and discharge or supply lines. Whereas it is possible, in case of accessible conduits, to employ the existing standard techniques for laying communications cables, the problems in case of inaccessible conduits are still unresolved to a very great extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When laying cables in inaccessible waste-water conduits (diameters of less than 20 cm), care has to be taken to ensure that </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> the hydraulically usable cross-sectional area is only slightly reduced; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> as far as possible, no objects must be laid transversely to the direction of flow; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> no points of attachment are produced which can lead to the formation of snags (for example, the accumulation of sewage materials) and consequently to obstruction; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> that cleaning of the waste-water conduit is not prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> DE 198 26 880 discloses a device which consists of a plastic element which is annular in cross-section and which, as a result of a memory effect, enlarges its outer diameter when heat is supplied or as a result of moistening. This takes advantage of the reverse shrinkage effect. The device is compressed after shaping, and will expand after being reheated. This reheating then takes place in the waste-water conduit, so that the device rests against the inner wall of the waste-water conduit. The plastic element is introduced into the waste-water conduit in the pressed state, with an optical or electric cable. In the expanded state, the plastic element will fix the optical or electric cable against the inner wall of the waste-water conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Plastics which have a pronounced memory effect consist of a relatively expensive material. In addition, this memory effect is inclined to decline gradually in the course of time. If these plastic elements are used in the form of a hose in order to simultaneously permit repair of the wastewater conduit, the usable clear space of the latter is then restricted to too great an extent. The result of this is that plastic elements of this kind do not represent an ideal solution for both fixing optical or electric cables and repairing the waste-water conduits. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The object underlying the invention is to develop plastic hoses which can be manufactured in a cost-effective manner and which retain a lasting, satisfactory shape in the installed state in the waste-water conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The object is achieved, according to the invention, by means of </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> a device for fixing an optical or electric cable against the inner wall of a pipe, with the aid of a plastic hose, which is annular in cross-section, wherein, in the clear state, the plastic hose has a diameter which is the same size as, or larger than, the diameter of the pipe; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> the methods of fixing an optical or electric cable against the inner wall of a pipe </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> wherein the cable is introduced into the pipe together with the plastic hose in the collapsed state and, after being correctly positioned, is fixed in the said pipe through the fact that an element such as air, gas or liquid is admitted to the said plastic hose; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> wherein the cable is introduced into the pipe together with the plastic hose in the collapsed state surrounding a flexible pipe and, after being correctly positioned, is fixed in the said pipe through the fact that an element such as air, gas or liquid is admitted to the said flexible pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The use of ordinary, cost-effective plastics such as polyethylene (PE) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can be guaranteed by using a plastic hose which, in the clear state, has a diameter which is the same size as, or larger than, the diameter of the waste-water conduit or pipe in which it is inserted. A plastic hose of this kind according to the invention can be brought into a collapsed state by inserting, for example, a degree of vacuum. This collapsed plastic hose may advantageously be rolled up axially, for example, so as to be introduced into the waste-water conduit without any problems. In this connection, use may be made of a travelling robot which introduces the collapsed, rolled-up hose into the wastewater conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is quite possible to apply a plastic hose of this kind according to the invention round a flexible pipe, which may optionally have regular openings. When a state of vacuum is set up in the flexible pipe, the plastic hose will collapse onto the latter. In this way, the said plastic hose can be easily introduced into the waste-water conduit together with the flexible pipe, optionally even without a robot. After the state of vacuum has been set aside by the admission of an element such as air, gas or liquid into the flexible pipe, the said element will penetrate into the collapsed plastic hose via the regular openings in the said flexible pipe. The plastic hose will thus attempt to assume its original shape and thereby apply itself against the inner wall of the waste-water conduit over its entire length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Advantageous refinements of the invention will emerge from the dependent claims, the following description and the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, for example a waste-water pipe or waste-water conduit, which has a certain cross-section, is drawn in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This pipe may, for example, form the final, lateral stretch to the subscriber&apos;s connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A plastic hose <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>according to the invention is drawn in the clear state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It has an annular cross-section which is the same size as, or larger than, the diameter of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or rather the inner diameter of the said pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in which it is laid. It is formed from an ordinary plastic such as PE or PVC. When a vacuum is set up in this hose <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, it will collapse along its axis <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This collapsed state <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is drawn in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In this collapsed state, the plastic hose can be easily rolled up along its axis as long as the state of vacuum is guaranteed. The individual ends must therefore be sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A typical cable used for telecommunications purposes, that is to say a purely optical or electric cable or a combined cable, is drawn in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the plastic hose is introduced into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the collapsed state <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, together with the cable <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. It can be seen that, in the collapsed state <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the plastic hose is distinctly smaller in cross-section than the cross-section of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The introduction of the said plastic hose, together with the cable to be fixed, can therefore take place easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> After the introduction of the plastic hose, together with the cable, has been completed, the seals can be destroyed or removed. As a result of this, the plastic hose should be able to assume its original shape again. An element such as air, gas or liquid may optionally be admitted into the plastic hose for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the state in which the plastic hose <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>covers the inner wall of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, fixes the cable <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to this wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is possible, and in some cases advantageous, to introduce the plastic hose into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the aid of a flexible pipe. This flexible pipe may have openings in order to cause the plastic hose to collapse uniformly along its entire length more easily, through the fact that the state of vacuum is transmitted to the plastic hose via the said flexible pipe. The collapsed plastic hose <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be introduced into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> together with the flexible pipe, optionally without a travelling robot. When an element such as air, gas or a liquid is admitted to the said flexible pipe, the collapsed plastic hose <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will attempt to regain its original shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> By choosing a cross-section for the plastic hose in the clear state which is the same size as, or even distinctly larger than, the diameter of the pipe into which it is introduced, it is guaranteed that the said plastic hose will retain its shape in a lasting manner. As a result of this, the repair of waste-water conduits, and/or the fixing of telecommunication cables against the inner wall of waste-water conduits of this kind, can take place in a favourable manner. </paragraph>
