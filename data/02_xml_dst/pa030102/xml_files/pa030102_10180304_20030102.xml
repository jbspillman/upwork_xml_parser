<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A camera uses a program shutter as a shutter device. When an exposure value becomes larger than EV9, a stop of the camera is closed down so as to increase an f-number. In a case that the camera is loaded with a photographic film having film sensitivity of ISO 1000 or more, an upper limit of a focus set position of a taking lens is fixed to 3 m. By utilizing a depth of field, a picture is taken in a state that a blur is reduced, relative to a subject existing within a range from a comparatively short photographic-distance to a far photographic-distance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a camera for taking a picture in a good focus condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, technology regarding a photographic film is improved so that the photographic film is adapted to have high sensitivity without deteriorating image quality. The photographic films of ISO 1000 and ISO 1600, for instance, tend to be used in general. When this kind of photographic film having high sensitivity is used in a room and at the midnight outdoors, it is possible to take a picture in proper brightness, whereas the background thereof becomes dark on another photographic film having comparatively low sensitivity. For example, when a picture is taken on condition that f-number of an exposure aperture of a camera is F4, proper exposure is obtained relative to subject brightness of BV0 by combining with a shutter speed of {fraction (1/30)} sec and by using the photographic film having film sensitivity of ISO 1600. Thus, an exposure amount is properly obtained relative to the background in a photographic scene of general room lighting and in a photographic scene having the background of a bright night view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Most of the currently-sold cameras comprise an automatic exposure mechanism (AE mechanism) and an autofocus mechanism. In a compact camera comprising the AE mechanism, the f-number and the shutter speed are determined so as to correspond to a proper exposure value, which is determined on the basis of measured subject brightness and sensitivity of the loaded photographic film. Many compact cameras use a program shutter controlling the exposure amount in accordance with the determined f-number and shutter speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although there are various programs used for the program shutter, many compact cameras adopt a program shifting the shutter speed to a high-speed side. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows an example of this kind of program. Such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, as the exposure value (EV) becomes large, the shutter speed is gradually shifted to the high-speed side, keeping the f-number of the aperture (F4 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). When the shutter speed becomes high ({fraction (1/250)} sec in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), the shutter speed is shifted to the high-speed side, increasing the f-number to close down a stop. The reason for adopting such a program is that camera-shake is prevented from occurring when using a telephoto lens or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The camera including the autofocus mechanism is provided with a measurement area, which is normally arranged at a central portion of a picture to be taken, to measure a distance to a subject existing in the measurement area. A projection amount of a taking lens is adjusted so as to automatically bring the measured distance into focus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> By the way, when using the high-sensitivity photographic film having the film sensitivity of ISO 1000 and ISO 1600, the exposure is performed within an exposure control range of the general compact camera so that it is possible to obtain a proper exposure amount. In a case of the program shutter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the proper exposure amount is about EV9 to EV13 upon using the photographic film of ISO 1600 when a picture is taken inside a room of which subject brightness is about BV0 to BV4. In this case, although the proper exposure amount is obtained, a depth of field becomes shallow, since the f-number of the aperture is used. Accordingly, there arises a problem in that all of the taken pictures have great blur with respect to the background, whereas the main subject is brought into focus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, when the autofocus mechanism of the camera is used for taking a picture, photographing is mistakenly performed if the measurement area is not set to the main subject at the time of framing. In this case, the main subject is not brought into focus, but the background is brought into focus. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a camera in which it is possible to take a picture in a good focus condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a second object of the present invention to provide a camera in which a main subject of a short distance and the background thereof are photographed in a good focus condition even if photographing is performed in a room. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above and other objects, the camera according to the present invention comprises a program shutter and a focal-position controller limiting a length for focusing within a range of 3 m or less. In the program shutter, a combination of a shutter speed and an f-number corresponding to each exposure value is determined so as to satisfying the following condition: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>0.5&lE;(<highlight><italic>AV</italic></highlight>11&minus;<highlight><italic>AV</italic></highlight>9)/(<highlight><italic>TV</italic></highlight>11&minus;<highlight><italic>TV</italic></highlight>9)&lE;2.0&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> wherein AV9 denotes an apex value of the f-number which is set when the exposure value is EV9, and TV9 denotes an apex value of the shutter speed at that time. Further, AV11 denotes the apex value of the f-number which is set when the exposure value is EV11, and TV11 denotes the apex value of the shutter speed at that time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the camera according to the present invention comprises a program shutter and a taking lens of a fixed-focus type in which a length for focusing is set within a range of 1.0 m to 3.0 m. In the program shutter, the combination of the shutter speed and the f-number corresponding to each exposure value is determined so as to satisfying the foregoing condition (1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a program of the program shutter is adapted to satisfy the forgoing condition (1). At the same time, when film sensitivity is ISO 1000 or more, the length for focusing is limited within a range of 3 m or less. Owing to this, when a photographic film of ISO 1000 or more is used, a main subject of a short distance and the background thereof can be photographed in a good focus condition even in a photographic environment of a room and so forth. Further, in the case that the taking lens of the fixed-focus type is used, the length for focusing is set within the range of 1.0 m to 3.0 m so that a main subject of a short distance and the background thereof can be photographed in a good focus condition even in a photographic environment of a room and so forth.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT (S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A camera according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The front of a camera body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided with a lens barrel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for holding a taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, light emitting and receiving windows <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for measuring a distance, a viewfinder <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a flash portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and a light-regulation window <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Further, a front side of the lens barrel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with a photometry window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Upon turning on a main switch of the camera, the lens barrel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> projects from a collapsible-mount position, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to a photographing position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A top face of the camera body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided with a release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a liquid-crystal panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and an operational portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The liquid-crystal panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> displays a residual number of photographable frames and a flash mode. By operating the operational portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the main switch and a self-timer are tuned on and off, and a flash mode is selected, for instance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As to the flash mode, it is possible to select one of an automatic flash mode, a flash compulsion mode, and a flash prohibition mode. In the automatic flash mode, the flash light is automatically emitted when subject brightness is low. In the flash compulsion mode, the flash light is emitted without regard to the subject brightness. In the flash prohibition mode, emitting the flash light is prohibited. In the camera of the present embodiment, when photographing is performed with the flash light, an exposure value is determined in accordance with the measured subject brightness. In other words, a combination of an f-number and a shutter speed is determined in accordance with the measured subject brightness. At the same time, with respect to a main subject of comparatively short distance, exposure amounts of the main subject and the background are adjusted so as to become proper by controlling a flash-light amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A light emitting unit for emitting a light toward a subject is disposed behind the light emitting window <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a light receiving unit for receiving the light reflected from the subject is disposed behind the light receiving window <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Further, a light-regulation sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and a light receiving element used for photometry are disposed behind the light-regulation window <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the photometry window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> respectively. The light-regulation sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives the flash light reflected from the subject. The light receiving element for photometry measures the subject brightness. The lens barrel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> contains a shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) being as a lens shutter, together with the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> comprises a shutter blade, which is also used as a stop blade. The shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is a program shutter performing an opening-and-closing operation in accordance with the f-number and the shutter speed, which are determined so as to correspond to the determined exposure value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Upon depressing the release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a half stroke, the light emitting unit for measuring the distance emits the light to the subject through the light emitting window <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. By receiving the reflected light with the light receiving unit through the light receiving window <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, is measured a photographic distance of the subject positioned within a measurement area, which is set at a central portion of a picture to be taken. Meanwhile, the light receiving element for photometry measures the subject brightness through the photometry window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of averaged light metering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Successively, when the release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fully depressed, a focusing operation of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is performed. After that, the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is actuated in accordance with the f-number and the shutter speed, which correspond to the exposure value calculated on the basis of the measured subject brightness and film sensitivity, to take a picture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The flash portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> comprises a diffusion plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a flash discharge tube (Xe tube) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) disposed behind the diffusion plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and so forth. The flash discharge tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> radiates the flash light, and the diffusion plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>diffuses the flash light in a predetermined radiation pattern. After the flash light has been emitted, the flash light reflected from the subject is received by the light-regulation sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to integrate the light amount. When an integral value of the light amount reaches a predetermined level, emitting the flash light is stopped. In this way, the exposure amount of the main subject, which is obtained by using the flash light, is controlled so as to become proper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The camera body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided with a film lid (not shown). By opening the film lid, a photographic film is contained and is drawn out. As to the photographic film, the 135 type is contained, for instance. However, an IX240 type of Advanced Photo System (APS) may be contained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Upon containing the photographic film, the film sensitivity thereof is automatically inputted into the camera and is set by a mechanism incorporated in the camera. In the case of the 135-type photographic film, a DX code provided on a cassette of the photographic film is read when the film sensitivity is inputted into the camera. In the case of the IX240-type photographic film, a bar code provided on a data disk is read. The data disk is rotatably disposed in a cartridge together with a spool. Of course, the film sensitivity may be manually inputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> partially shows a structure of the camera. A microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a CPU and various interface circuits, all of which are unified in one chip. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to a ROM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a RAM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The ROM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>stores a program for executing a photographic sequence. This program includes a control program according to the present invention, and along this program, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> controls each section of the camera. The RAM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is used as a work memory for temporarily storing the film sensitivity, which is inputted from a sensitivity input member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and various data required for executing the photographic sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The sensitivity input member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is for distinguishing and inputting the film sensitivity. The sensitivity input member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> electrically reads the DX code provided on the cassette of the photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, when the IX240-type photographic film is used, the sensitivity input member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a bar-code sensor for photoelectrically reading the bar code of the data disk. In the case that the film sensitivity is manually inputted, the sensitivity input member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is constituted of a switch or the like externally operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is the program shutter comprising the shutter blade, which is also used as the stop blade, such as mentioned above. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> sets the exposure value to the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. When a shutter drive signal is inputted from the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in response to the full depression of the release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> opens the shutter to expose the photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with the set exposure value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In response to the shutter drive signal, the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> moves the shutter blade in an open direction. In doing so, a diameter of a stop aperture formed by the shutter blade is gradually increased up to a diameter corresponding to the f-number (hereinafter called as set f-number), which is solely determined in accordance with the set exposure value. When the diameter of the stop aperture reaches the diameter corresponding to the set f-number, the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> keeps the current state for a period corresponding to the shutter speed. After that, the shutter blade is moved in a closed direction, which is the backward direction to the open direction. Thus, the diameter of the stop aperture is gradually decreased and the stop aperture is finally closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, for the purpose of making a depth of field deep from a stage of the small exposure value, a combination of the f-number and the shutter speed (hereinafter called as program), which corresponds to each exposure value, is predetermined such that the f-number becomes small from the stage of the small exposure value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Concretely, the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has the program in that the f-number is larger than the f-number of an exposure aperture when the exposure value is larger than EV<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Thus, in the case of this program, photographing is performed in a state that the stop is closed down. This kind of program satisfies the following condition: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>0.5&lE;(<highlight><italic>AV</italic></highlight>11&minus;<highlight><italic>AV</italic></highlight>9)/(<highlight><italic>TV</italic></highlight>11&minus;<highlight><italic>TV</italic></highlight>9)&lE;2.0 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> wherein AV9 denotes an apex value of the f-number (AV value) corresponding to EV9, TV9 denotes an apex value of the shutter speed (TV value) corresponding thereto, AV11 denotes the apex value of the f-number corresponding to EV11, and TV11 denotes the apex value of the shutter speed corresponding thereto. Incidentally, it is preferable to satisfy the following condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>0.7&lE;(<highlight><italic>AV</italic></highlight>11&minus;<highlight><italic>AV</italic></highlight>9)/(<highlight><italic>TV</italic></highlight>11&minus;<highlight><italic>TV</italic></highlight>9)&lE;1.5 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a program diagram showing an example of the program of the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> used in the camera. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> vertical line and a horizontal line represent the AV value and the TV value respectively, further, the f-number and the shutter speed corresponding thereto are respectively entered as well. The shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is capable of controlling the exposure within a range of EV4 to EV18. The aperture f-number F4 and the shutter speed &ldquo;1 sec&rdquo; are combined at the time of EV4. As the exposure value increases from EV4, the shutter speed is shifted to a high-speed side in the state that the f-number is kept at the aperture f-number F4. After exceeding EV9, the stop is gradually closed down from the aperture f-number F4. Simultaneously, the shutter speed is shifted to the high-speed side. At the time of EV18, the minimum f-number F22 and the shutter speed &ldquo;{fraction (1/500)} sec&rdquo; are combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the f-number AV9 and the shutter speed TV9 corresponding to EV9 are &ldquo;4&rdquo; (F4) and &ldquo;5&rdquo; ({fraction (1/30)} sec) respectively. Moreover, the f-number AV11 and the shutter speed TV11 corresponding to EV11 are about &ldquo;5.1&rdquo; and about &ldquo;5.9&rdquo; respectively. Upon calculation with accurate values of AV11 and TV11, a value of &ldquo;(AV11&minus;AV9)/(TV11&minus;TV9)&rdquo; is &ldquo;1.25&rdquo; so that the foregoing condition is satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As to a method for carrying out the program shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is easily performed to slow down an operation speed of a shutter blade employed in a conventional shutter device. In this case, a size of the stop aperture is changed such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> when the exposure value is EV9, and is changed such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> when the exposure value is EV11. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, the size of the stop aperture changes so as to be shown by a broken line of the respective drawings before the operation speed of the shutter blade is slowed down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generates synchro signals at the time of the predetermined f-number, which is more closed dawn than the aperture f-number, and at the time of the set f-number. If the predetermined f-number is equal to the set f-number, the sole synchro signal is generated. The synchro signal from the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is sent to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is used for controlling flash timing. In this embodiment, the predetermined f-number is set to F11. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> activates a distance measurement unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a photometry unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> when the release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is depressed by a half stroke. The distance measurement unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> includes a light-emitting device and a light-receiving device to measure a photographic distance of a subject arranged at a central portion of a picture to be taken. The photometry unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a light-receiving element for photometry to measure subject brightness of a photographic area. Information concerning the photographic distance obtained by the distance measurement unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is transferred to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Moreover, information concerning the subject brightness obtained by the photometry unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is also transferred to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> calculates the proper exposure value from the obtained subject brightness and the film sensitivity of the loaded photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The calculated exposure value is set to the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. If the automatic flash mode is selected, whether the flash light is emitted or not is determined in accordance with the measured subject brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A focusing mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is constituted of a motor and a drive circuit to adjust a projection amount of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The focusing mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is controlled by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the film sensitivity of the loaded photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is less than ISO 1000, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> controls the focusing mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to adjust the projection amount of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> such that the focus is set to the photographic distance based on the information obtained from the distance measurement unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, when the film sensitivity of the loaded photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is ISO 1000 or more, a length to which the focus is set is limited to 3 m or less by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This length is called as, &ldquo;focus set position&rdquo;, hereinafter. In other words, when the photographic distance measured by the distance measurement unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is 3 m or less, the projection amount of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is adjusted so as to set the focus to the photographic distance based on the information, which is obtained from the distance measurement unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, similarly to the case in that the film sensitivity is less than the ISO 1000. However, when the photographic distance exceeds 3 m, the focusing mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> adjusts the projection amount of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to set the focus to a subject, the photographic distance of which is 3 m, regardless of the photographic distance measured by the distance measurement unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. By the way, in the present embodiment, the upper limit of the focus set position is 3 m when the film sensitivity is ISO 1000 or more. This upper limit, however, may be less than 3 m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The camera employs the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> adopting the above-mentioned program. Owing to this, when using the photographic film having high sensitivity, the depth of field becomes deep by closing down the stop more than the aperture f-number, even if photographing is performed in a room. When the film sensitivity is ISO 1000 or more, the upper limit of the focus set position is 3 m as stated above. Thus, even if a picture is taken in a room, the focus set position and the f-number are combined so as to take the picture in good focus condition relative to both of the short-distance main subject and the comparatively-separated background. In other words, the depth of field is elongated by closing down the stop, and at the same time, a distance range included in the depth of field is properly set by limiting the focus set position within a proper range. In virtue of this, a blur of the subject is reduced as small as possible from the comparatively-short distance to the infinity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When the film sensitivity is ISO 1000 or more, the range of the focus set position is restricted such as described above. Thus, it is prevented to mistakenly take a picture, in which the focus is not adjusted to the main subject but is adjusted to the background, when the measurement area of the picture to be taken is shifted from the main subject at the time of framing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A flash device is an automatic type, which comprises a charge-and-discharge circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a light-regulation circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> besides the light-regulation sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the flash discharge tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which are respectively disposed behind the light-regulation window <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and inside the flash portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The charge-and-discharge circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> charges a main capacitor (not shown) up to a predetermined level when the main switch of the camera is turned on. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> inputs a flash start signal into the charge-and-discharge circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> when the flash light is emitted. Upon inputting the flash start signal, the charge-and-discharge circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> applies a trigger voltage to the flash discharge tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that an electric charge of the main capacitor is discharged in the flash discharge tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to start the emission of the flash light. Incidentally, when the flash is used, the shutter speed is limited so as to be faster than &ldquo;{fraction (1/30)} sec&rdquo; for the purpose of preventing camera movement blur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The light-regulation sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives the flash light reflected by the subject during the emission of the flash light. Further, the light-regulation sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> lets a photoelectric current flow in accordance with an amount of the received light. The light-regulation circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> integrates the amount of the reflected flash light received by the light-regulation sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, on the basis of the photoelectric current flowing from the light-regulation sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the integrated amount has reached a predetermined stop level, the charge-and-discharge circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is controlled to stop the flash light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When the subject brightness is low under the automatic flash mode or when the flash compulsion mode is selected, the flash start signal is sent to the charge-and-discharge circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at the moment that the first synchro signal is inputted from the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As described above, the synchro signals are generated when the diameter of the stop aperture formed by the shutter blade corresponds to each of the predetermined f-number (F11) and the set f-number. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in the case that the set f-number is within a range of F4 to F11, the flash light is emitted when the diameter of the stop aperture corresponds to the f-number F11. In the case that the set f-number exceeds F11, the flash light is emitted when the diameter of the stop aperture corresponds to the set f-number currently preserved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the camera according to the present invention, the flash light is emitted in the state that the f-number is more closed than the f-number of the aperture. Owing to this, the depth of field is deepened at the time of flash photographing so that it is reduced to photograph an unfocused main subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The flash stop level is determined by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is set to the light-regulation circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> calculates the flash stop level so as to make the exposure amount proper. The flash stop level is calculated on the basis of the f-number for the flash photographing and the film sensitivity of the photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, an operation of the above structure is described below. A photographer turns on the main switch with the operational portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to set a photographable state when taking a picture. Further, the photographer selects the flash mode, if necessary. After that, the photographer determines the framing through the viewfinder <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and depresses the release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, upon depressing the release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a half stroke, the distance measurement unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the photometry unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are activated. The distance measurement unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> measures the photographic distance of the central subject of the picture to be taken. The photometry unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> measures the subject brightness of the whole of the picture to be taken. The information concerning the photographic distance and the subject brightness are transferred to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> After receiving the information concerning the photographic distance and the subject brightness, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> accesses the RAM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to read the film sensitivity of the loaded photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Then, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> calculates the exposure value corresponding to the proper exposure amount, on the basis of the film sensitivity and the subject brightness transferred from the photometry unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The calculated exposure value is set to the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Successively, whether the flash light is emitted or not is confirmed. When the flash light is not emitted, namely when the subject brightness is high under the automatic flash mode or when the flash prohibition mode is selected, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> waits until the release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fully depressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fully depressed, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> drives the focusing mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to adjust the projection amount of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. At this time, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> checks the film sensitivity of the photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> previously obtained by accessing the RAM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. When the film sensitivity is less than ISO 1000 or when the film sensitivity is ISO 1000 or more and the photographic distance is 3 m or less, the distance of the photographic-distance information is dealt with as the focus set position. However, when the film sensitivity is ISO 1000 or more and the photographic distance is 3 m or more, the focus set position is regarded as 3 m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In this way, the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is moved by the focusing mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> under the control of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to adjust the projection amount of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> such that the focus is set to the subject distance determined on the basis of the film sensitivity of the photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the measured photographic distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> After adjusting the projection amount of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the shutter drive signal is sent from the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In response to the shutter drive signal, the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is driven. The shutter blade is moved in the open direction so that the diameter of the stop aperture gradually increases up to the diameter corresponding to the set f-number. This diameter is kept during the period corresponding to the shutter speed. Then, the diameter of the stop aperture is gradually decreased and is closed. In the present embodiment, when the exposure value is EV9 or more bright, namely when the shutter speed is {fraction (1/30)} sec or more fast, the decrement operation of the stop-aperture diameter is started at the moment that the diameter has reached the stop diameter corresponding to the set f-number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> While the stop aperture is formed by opening and closing the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the photographic light of the available light enters the photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the stop aperture so that the photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the case that the picture is taken by using the photographic film having high sensitivity of ISO 1000 or more, the focus set position is adjusted to 3 m when the main-subject distance is more than 3 m. In this case, the main subject is not brought into focus perfectly. However, the used shutter device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is programmed so as to be closed down from the stage in that the exposure value is comparatively small. Thus, even in a comparatively dark condition, for example in a room, the depth of field becomes deep since the picture is taken with the large f-number. Further, the focus set position is adjusted to 3 m so that the focusing range substantially exists near the photographic distance of 3 m. In other words, the depth of field substantially exists near the photographic distance of 3 m. As to this range, a rear side thereof is broader than a front side (camera side) thereof. Owing to this, the subject is photographed from 3 m to the infinity in a focus state substantially having no problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Even if photographing is performed in a state that the background is mistakenly regarded as a main subject when the focus should be set to the main subject of comparatively short distance, it is prevented to cause a failure in that the focus is set to only the background, since the picture is taken in the focus state having no problems from the short distance to the long distance, as described in the above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, in the case that the flash light is emitted when the subject brightness is low under the automatic flash mode or when the flash compulsion mode is selected, a light-level setting process is executed by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> after setting the exposure value to the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In the light-level setting process, when the set f-number corresponding to the exposure value, which is determined on the basis of the subject brightness and the film sensitivity, is F11 or less, the flash stop level is determined by using the film sensitivity of the loaded photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the f-number F11 such that the proper exposure amount is obtained for the loaded photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> when the flash light is emitted on condition that the f-number is F11. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the set f-number is more than F11, the flash stop level is determined by using the current set f-number and the film sensitivity of the photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such that the proper exposure amount is obtained for the photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> when the flash light is emitted on condition of the current set f-number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> After the flash stop level has been determined, the microcomputer waits until the release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fully depressed. Upon full-depression of the release button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the projection amount of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is adjusted similarly to the above. Then, the opening-and-closing operation of the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is performed in response to the shutter drive signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> While the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is operated, the stop aperture formed by the shutter blade reaches the diameter corresponding to either of the set f-number and the predetermined f-number F11. At the moment that the stop aperture has reached the corresponding diameter, the synchro signal outputted from the shutter device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is inputted into the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Upon this, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> sends the flash start signal to the charge-and-discharge circuit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the flash device. The flash discharge tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> starts to flash so that the flash light is emitted from the flash portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> toward the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> During the emission of the flash light, a part of the flash light reflected by the main subject enters the photographic film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the stop aperture to expose the photographic film. The exposure of the main subject is performed by the flash light in the state that the stop is more closed down than the aperture f-number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A part of the reflected flash light is received by the light-regulation sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the light-regulation window <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. On the basis of the photoelectric current flowing from the light-regulation sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the light amount is integrated by the light-regulation circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the integrated amount reaches the flash stop level determined by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the flash light is stopped at that moment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the flash photographing, even if a picture is taken with the aperture f-number or the other f-number approximate thereto, the flash light is emitted in the state that the stop is more closed down than the aperture f-number. Thus, the main subject is photographed with the flash light in the good focus condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows diameters of circles of confusion on a photo print in the case that the focus set position is adjusted to 3 m and the infinity. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the diameter of the circle of confusion is calculated relative to each photographic distance on the following conditions. A focal length of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is 28 mm, the f-number is F11 when photographing, and a print magnification (enlargement ratio) is 3.53 when the photo print is produced from the photographic film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As will be understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, when the focus set position is adjusted to 3 m, the diameter of the circle of confusion is less than 0.1 mm on the photo print within a range of about 1.5 m to the infinity so that a sharp image brought in focus is reproduced. By contrast, in the case that the focus set position is adjusted to the infinity, the diameter of the circle of confusion increases to deteriorate the focus condition when the photographic distance is less than <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the diameter of the circle of confusion in the case that the f-number is F11. Although the diameter of the circle of confusion slightly increases when the f-number is more opened than F11 to some extent, the focus condition is kept in a comparatively good state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the above-described camera is loaded with the photographic film having high sensitivity of ISO 1000 or more, the main subject of comparatively short distance and the background thereof may be photographed on the good focus condition even in the photographic environment of the indoor and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, when the photographic film of ISO 1000 or more is loaded, the upper limit of the focus set position is always fixed to 3 m. However, whether the upper limit of the focus set position is fixed or not may be determined in accordance with the f-number and the emission of the flash light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows another embodiment in that setting of the upper limit of the focus set position is determined in accordance with the f-number and the emission of the flash light on condition that the photographic film of ISO 1000 or more is loaded. Incidentally, this embodiment is similar to the above embodiment except the following so that the component which is substantially similar to that of the above embodiment is denoted by the same reference numeral and the detailed description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, similarly to the above embodiment, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fixes the upper limit of the focus set position to 3 m without regard to the f-number when the photographic film of ISO 1000 or more is loaded and the flash light is emitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, when the photographic film of ISO 1000 or more is loaded and the flash light is not emitted, the upper limit of the focus set position is fixed to 3 m if the f-number is less than F11 (large stop). However, if the f-number is F11 or more (small stop), the projection amount of the taking lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is adjusted so as to focus on the subject distance measured by the distance measurement unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the case that the flash light is emitted, it is sufficient to include a flash available distance within the depth of field. In other words, it is sufficient to include a comparatively short distance within the depth of field. In this case, it is judged that the measurement result of the infinity, for example, is caused by a mistake of measuring. In view of this, when the flash light is emitted, the upper limit of the focus set position is fixed to 3 m for the purpose of minimizing the blur of the main subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> By contrast, in the case that the flash light is not emitted, the photographic distance is sometimes adjusted to the infinity to photograph a landscape, and sometimes a short-distance subject is photographed. Thus, when the f-number is F11 or more, the limitation of the focus set position is removed and focusing is performed on the basis of the measurement result. Further, when the f-number is less than the F11, the upper limit of the focus set position is fixed to 3 m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the other embodiment of the camera having a taking lens of a fixed-focus type. This embodiment is also similar to the first embodiment except the following so that a component which is substantially similar to that of the first embodiment is denoted by same reference numeral and the detailed description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The camera of this embodiment has the taking lens <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the fixed-focus type. In this camera, a subject distance is not measured and the projection amount of the taking lens <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is not adjusted in accordance with the measured distance. The taking lens <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is adapted to set a length for focusing, or the focus set position, to any position within a range of 1.0 m to 3.0 m. Although the taking lens <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is the fixed-focus type, it is possible to obtain an effect similar to the first embodiment by setting the fixed focus set position to any position of the range of 1.0 m to 3.0 m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Each of the above embodiments adopts the program shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In this program, when the exposure value is EV9 or more, the stop is continuously closed down as the exposure value increases, and at the same time, the shutter speed is shifted to the high-speed side. However, another program may be adopted to the shutter device if the condition of &ldquo;0.5&lE;(AV11&minus;AV9)/(TV11&minus;TV9)&lE;2.0&rdquo; is satisfied, and more preferably, the condition of &ldquo;0.7&lE;(AV11&minus;AV9)/(TV11&minus;TV9)&lE;1.5&rdquo; is satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In a program shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, when the exposure value increases from EV9 to EV10, the stop is closed down by one step without changing the shutter speed. Moreover, when the exposure value increases from EV10 to EV11, the shutter speed is shifted to the high-speed side by one step without changing the f-number. Further, when the exposure value increases from EV11 to EV12, the stop is closed down without changing the shutter speed. In this case, a value of (AV11&minus;AV9)/(TV11&minus;TV9) is &ldquo;1&rdquo;. This kind of program may be realized by adjusting periods for keeping the diameters corresponding to the f-numbers of F5.6 and F8, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, the used flash device is the automatic type in which the flash light is controlled in accordance with the received light amount of the reflected flash light. However, it is possible to use a flash device of a flashmatic type in which the exposure amount obtained by the flash light is adjusted in accordance with a size of the stop aperture. Also in the case of the flashmatic type, the flash light is preferable to be emitted when the stop is more closed down than the aperture stop. Moreover, the light amount of the one-time flash light may be increased or decreased so as to obtain a proper exposure amount in a state that the stop is more closed down than the aperture stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been fully described by way of the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, various changes and modifications will be apparent to those having skill in this field. Therefore, unless otherwise these changes and modifications depart from the scope of the present invention, they should be construed as included therein. </paragraph>
