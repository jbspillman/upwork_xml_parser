<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A metal plate of a recording tape cartridge is provided with a tapered portion at an outer circumference thereof. In a state in which the metal plate is attached at a fixed-side mold plate of a metal mold for molding a reel hub and a lower flange, a gap is formed between the tapered portion and the fixed-side mold plate. During molding, molding material flows into the gap. Because of this gap, an annular pawl portion is formed at the reel hub, which annular pawl portion integrally joins the metal plate with the reel hub by sandwiching the metal plate via the tapered portion. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a recording tape cartridge for rotatably accommodating a reel on which a recording tape is wound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a conventionally known type of recording tape cartridge for a recording medium for use as an external storage device of a computer or the like, a single reel, on which a recording tape such as a magnetic tape is wound, is rotatably accommodated in the recording tape cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A magnetic tape is used, for example, for storing computer data. The tape cartridge is structured so as to prevent the magnetic tape, which may contain important information, from jamming or the like, and from being unwound unintentionally when not in use, such as during storage or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The reel comprises a reel hub and upper and lower flanges, which are disposed at both ends of the reel hub. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29, a</cross-reference> reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and a lower flange <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are integrally molded and, after the molding, an upper flange <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is welded to the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to form a reel <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A magnetic tape can be wound on the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, and width-directional end portions of the wound-on magnetic tape are retained by the upper and lower flanges <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</cross-reference>, the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is provided with a driven gear <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, which meshes with a driving gear for transmitting driving force from a drive-side driving device (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> At an inner side of the driven gear <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is disposed a metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> for magnetic attachment. The metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is magnetically attracted by a magnet disposed at the drive-side driving device, thus preventing misalignment of the axis and keeping the meshing state of the driven gear <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and the driving gear. However, because the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is provided with the driven gear <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, the metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, and the like, variations of pressure during the molding may affect the lower flange <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> molded integrally with the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, reducing flatness of the lower flange <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, and this may be a cause of surface-runout in the drive. Further, because the flatness of the lower flange <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is lowered, roundness of the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> deteriorates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is integrally molded with the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> inside a metal mold which molds the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Three through-holes <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> for joining the metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> are formed at regular intervals in the metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> on a concentric circle thereof. During molding, a molding material flows into the through-holes <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> to fix the metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the metal mold, a position corresponding to an inner circumferential portion of the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is a gate position. When the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are molded, the molding material flows in a space defined by the metal mold from the position corresponding to the inner circumferential portion of the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> towards positions corresponding to a distal portion of the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, and in radial directions towards positions corresponding to an outer circumferential portion of the lower flange <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When the molding material flows into the through-holes <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> formed in the metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, air in the through-holes <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> causes friction that resists the molding material. Therefore, comparing with a case in which the molding material flows around the metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the pressure is increased. This causes variations in the pressure in a cavity <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, and disturbs stress balance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Because the stress balance is disturbed when the molding material is filled, the disturbed stress balance is manifested as residual stress after the molding, and causes deformation of the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. Therefore, there is a risk of lowering the accuracy of the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the driven gear <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, and the flatness of the lower flange <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, because within the through-hole <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> (shown by arrows) moves during hardening of the molding material, wrinkles <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> are produced. Particularly, if the wrinkles <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> produce differences in the level of the outer circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>), a winding state of the magnetic tape on the reel may be disturbed, and magnetic surfaces at the inner and outer circumferential sides of the magnetic tape may be scratched by the tape&apos;s edges. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In view of the aforementioned, an object of the present invention is to provide a recording tape cartridge comprising a highly accurate reel including highly flat flanges. Further, there is a demand for improving breaking power of the reel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect of the present invention, a single reel, on which a recording tape is wound, is rotatably accommodated in a recording tape cartridge. The reel includes a hollow hub on which the recording tape is wound. Annular flanges are disposed at both ends of the hub for holding width-directional ends of the recording tape wound on the hub. Also, a metal plate is inserted at one end of the hub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The hub is formed such that cross-sections taken radially from an axis thereof are the same as each other. This makes flowing states of a molding material the same for the respective cross-sectional directions. Therefore, the flowing state of the molding material does not differ with circumferential position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the first aspect of the present invention, an annular joining device that joins to an outer circumference of the metal plate may be provided at the hub. By joining the outer circumference of the metal plate inserted at the end of the hub using the annular joining device, cross-sections of the hub, taken radially from the axis thereof, can be made the same as each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further, since there is no need to provide a hole or the like in the metal plate, variations in the pressure of the molding material flowing over the metal plate are small. Therefore, residual stress can be reduced, thereby improving accuracy of the hub and flatness of the flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, by joining the metal plate firmly at the outer circumference thereof, the internal dimensions of a portion for joining the metal plate is increased compared with the case in which the metal plate is provided with holes. This means air is easier to remove and less likely to stay. Thus, no wrinkles are created on the hub and the flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the first aspect of the present invention, the joining device may include a joining portion provided at the end of the hub. The joining portion surrounds an annular joined portion extending from an entire outer circumference of the metal plate, and joins the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the joining portion may be an annular pawl portion that holds the joined portion. By provision of the pawl portion, the metal plate is prevented from coming off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the joined portion may join by projecting toward a side away from the pawl portion and meshing with the hub. Thus, the metal plate is firmly fixed to the hub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, an annular fitting portion can be provided in a metal mold for molding the hub, and an annular fitting portion, which fits to the fitting portion of the mold can be formed at the metal plate. Thus, the metal plate is assuredly fixed in the metal mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect of the present invention, a recording tape cartridge rotatably accommodates a reel on which a recording tape is wound, and the reel includes a hollow hub on which the recording tape is wound. Flanges are welded at both ends of the hub, and the flanges retain the width-directional ends of the recording tape that is wound on the hub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the hub and the flanges are separately molded, and the flanges are then welded at the both ends of the hub to form the reel. Separately molding the hub and the flanges allows selection of a suitable gating system, for example disc gates, and setting of optimal molding conditions for each shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Therefore, compared with the case in which the hub and the flange are integrally molded, variations in pressure of the hub can be reduced and flatness of the flanges can be improved. Further, roundness of the hub can be improved by the improvement in the flatness of the flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by welding the hub and the flange, they can be united with greater certainty and less backlash compared with the case in which a flange and hub are provided with pawl portions for fitting to each other, and can be united more simply compared with the case in which a flange and hub are threaded and screwed together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the second aspect of the present invention, a first weld boss may be provided projecting from a welding surface, for welding to the flange, along a circumferential direction of a collar provided at an outer circumferential surface of the hub. A second weld boss may be provided projecting from another welding surface, for welding to the other flange, along a circumferential direction of a stepped portion provided at an inner circumferential surface of the hub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By providing the first weld boss and the second weld boss projecting from the welding surfaces, the weld bosses can be fused to weld the flanges to the hub when frictional heat is generated between the flanges and the hub by vibrational energy from an ultrasonic welder. Therefore, compared with the case in which no weld boss is provided, the flanges and hub can be welded together more firmly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the second aspect of the present invention, a gap may be formed between the outer circumferential surface of the collar and the hub and an inner circumferential surface of the flange, so that residue of the first weld boss can run into the gap. According to the second aspect of the present invention, when two members are to be welded, one of the welding surfaces is provided with a projecting weld boss, and the weld boss is fused for welding. By forming the gap between the inner circumferential surface of the flange and the outer circumferential surface of the collar of the hub, and allowing the residue from the welding surface to run into the gap, the residue of the welding can be prevented from running over onto the surface of the flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the second aspect of the present invention, a gap may be formed between a wall surface of the stepped portion and an outer circumferential surface of a boss provided at an inner circumferential portion of the flange, so that residue of the second weld boss can run into this gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the second aspect of the present invention, instead of the first weld boss, a third weld boss may be provided at a stepped portion cut into the outer circumferential surface of the hub, and an upper surface of the flange may make surface contact with a ceiling portion of this stepped portion. In this structure, a gap is formed between a wall surface of the stepped portion and an inner circumferential surface of the flange, so that residue of the third weld boss can run into this gap. Thus, edges of the recording tape can be prevented from coming into the gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect of the present invention, a recording tape cartridge rotatably accommodates a reel on which a recording tape is wound. The reel includes a core. An annular lower flange is integrally molded with the core and positioned at one end side of the core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Outside the core, a cylindrical hub, on which the recording tape is wound, is disposed and fixed at the lower flange. Further, an upper flange is fixed at the other end side of the core, and the upper flange and lower flange held width-directional ends of the recording tape wound on the hub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> By disposing the hub outside the core and winding the recording tape on the hub, even if the core becomes inclined due to thermal contraction after the molding of the core and the lower flange, the inclination of the core does not affect winding of the recording tape, and a highly accurate hub can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the third aspect of the present invention, the hub may include a sleeve attached at an annular depression formed in the lower flange on a concentric circle thereof. During thermal contraction after molding, the thermal contraction is effected along radial directions of the core and the lower flange. Therefore, the annular depression follows the thermal contraction of the core and the lower flange. By providing the annular depression on a concentric circle of the lower flange, and fitting the sleeve in the annular depression, the axis of the sleeve is aligned with axes of the core and the lower flange. Therefore, the axis of the sleeve does not deviate with respect to the lower flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the third aspect of the present invention, a small diameter portion may be provided at one end side of the sleeve, and the small diameter portion may be attached to the annular depression. In this structure, a shoulder portion between the small diameter portion and a large diameter portion abuts on the lower flange. Therefore, even if there is a gap formed between the small diameter portion and the annular depression, the recording tape will not come into the gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the third aspect of the present invention, the sleeve of the hub is inserted in a metal mold for molding the core and the lower flange. Thus, labor for attaching the sleeve after the molding of the core and the lower flange can be saved. Therefore, production steps can be reduced, thereby reducing production costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the third aspect of the present invention, a metal sleeve may be used. Since metals have a lower coefficient of linear expansion than synthetic resins, use of the metal sleeve provides a highly accurate hub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the third aspect of the present invention, engaging portions for engaging with the upper flange and the lower flange may be provided at the sleeve at an inner circumferential surface side thereof. In this structure, the recording tape is wound only on the sleeve. Therefore, even if size is irregular at engaged portions of the upper flange and the lower flange which engage with the sleeve, this irregularity does not affect the winding of the recording tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a fourth aspect of the present invention, the reel includes a hollow hub on which recording tape is wound, and annular flanges are disposed at both ends of the hub for holding the width-directional ends of the recording tape wound on the hub. A reel rotation gear is disposed at one end of the hub, and a plate is disposed inside the reel rotation gear, which plate can be attracted by a magnet disposed at a drive for writing/reading information on/from the recording tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A braking gear is provided at an outer circumference of one flange, and the braking gear can engage with a braking member disposed in a case that accommodates the reel. By providing the braking gear at the outer circumference of the flange to effect braking, unintended rotation of the reel when the recording tape cartridge is not in use can naturally be prevented with certainty. Further, compared with a case in which the braking gear is provided at a core side of the flange, required braking force is smaller and pitch of the braking gear can be increased. Therefore, failures such as breakage of the braking gear will not be caused. Moreover, since the braking gear is not provided at the core side of the flange, molding accuracy of the reel can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the fourth aspect of the present invention, the braking member is urged by an urging device in a direction in which it engages with the braking gear. At a time when a driving gear, which is disposed at the drive and can mesh with the reel rotation gear, meshes with the reel rotation gear, the braking member is pushed in a direction against the urging device to release engagement between the braking member and the braking gear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In other words, when the driving gear is not meshed with the reel rotation gear, the braking member urged by the urging device engages with the braking gear to block rotation of the reel. On the other hand, at the same time as the driving gear meshes with the reel rotation gear, the braking member is pushed in the direction against the urging device to release engagement between the braking member and the braking gear. Therefore, driving force from the driving gear can be transmitted to the reel rotation gear to rotate the reel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the fourth aspect of the present invention, the pitch of the braking gear may be in a range from 1 mm to 3.5 mm. As a result, the braking gear is not easily broken.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A recording tape cartridge according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be described. It should be noted that, for convenience of explanation, a direction in which the recording tape cartridge is mounted into a drive is referred to as a forward direction, and expressions such as front, back, right, left, upper and lower are based on this direction. Further, the recording tape used is a magnetic tape, and the following description is made with respect to a magnetic tape cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> First, an outline of the magnetic tape cartridge according to the first embodiment of the present invention is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an upper case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a lower case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which are made of synthetic resin and formed in a substantially rectangular box shape. A peripheral wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the upper case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a peripheral wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the lower case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are welded together by ultrasonic welding or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Substantially cylindrical walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are formed standing respectively from inner surfaces of the upper case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the lower case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Internal diameters of the cylindrical walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are slightly larger than external diameters of an upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of a reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is rotatably accommodated in the cylindrical walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Ribs <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are provided between the cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the upper case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and ribs <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are provided between the cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the lower case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The ribs <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> respectively connect the cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thereby reinforcing the cylindrical walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and the upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> disposed at both ends of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> retain width-directional edges of a magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is a medium for writing and reading information, wound around the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A bottom wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> including a hole <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A formed in the center thereof is provided at the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> side of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. An annular reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (driven gear) is formed at a lower surface side of the bottom wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> projecting from the bottom wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be exposed through a circular opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> provided in the center of the lower case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so as to mesh with a driving gear <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> provided at a drive <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and transmit rotational force to the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> An annular metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is integrally molded at an inner side of the reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The metal plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is attracted by a magnet (not shown) disposed at the drive <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in order to prevent axial misalignment, and thus maintain the meshing state of the reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with the driving gear <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> An annular groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is provided outside the reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A rib <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which is provided standing from a peripheral portion of the opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> provided in the lower case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is inserted in the annular groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> so that the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is positioned with respect to the lower case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Further, an annular reel gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is formed at an upper surface side of the bottom wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The reel gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can mesh with a braking gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> provided at a lower surface outer circumferential portion of a substantially disk-shaped braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which can be accommodated in the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Substantially U shaped (when viewed from above) ribs <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;U-rib&rdquo;) are provided standing up from the braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Also, a pair of locking pins <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, which can engage with the U-rib <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, is suspended from the center of the inner surface of the upper case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Thus, the braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can move within the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the U-rib <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can move along the locking pins <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and rotation of the braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is blocked. Therefore, when the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not in use, the braking gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is meshed with the reel gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to prevent rotation of the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Further, an annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is provided at the braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> outside the U-rib <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Also, an annular projection <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is provided at the upper case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> outside the locking pins <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The annular projection <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the annular groove <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> hold a spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which is mounted between the braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the upper case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Thus, the braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is urged toward the reel gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> so that the braking gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> firmly meshes with the reel gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, thereby assuredly preventing unintended rotation of the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> A substantially cylindrical projection <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, which can be inserted into a hole <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A, is provided at the center of a lower surface of the braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Before the reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> meshes with the driving gear <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to transmit rotational force to the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a mesh-release pin <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, which is provided at a tip of a rotating shaft <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the drive <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, abuts the projection <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to push up the braking member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in a direction against urging force of the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thereby releasing meshing between the braking gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Thus, rotation of the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is permitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, openings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are formed respectively at front-left corners of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the upper case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and that of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the lower case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are provided such that the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> wound around the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be drawn out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> A leader block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is attached at an end of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A pulling pin (not shown) provided at the drive engages with a recess <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> formed in the leader block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is wound by a winding reel provided at the drive. At this time, the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the winding reel are driven to rotate synchronously, and data is written or read while the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sequentially wound onto the winding reel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not in use, the leader block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is locked at peripheral edges of the openings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and the openings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are closed by the leader block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Next, the reel of the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment of the present invention is described. It should be noted that explanations of parts that overlap the above description are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which form the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, are integrally molded. A weld boss <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for ultrasonic welding, which has a substantially triangular cross section, is provided projecting from an end surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> After the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> have been molded, the upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is placed on top of the weld boss <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and the weld boss <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is fused by ultrasonic waves to weld the upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the end surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, thereby forming the reel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are formed using molding materials which are mutually compatible. Therefore, the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be welded together using ultrasonic waves. Examples of types of the molding materials include combinations of resins such as PMMA and ABS, AS and ABS, and combinations of polycarbonates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> An inner circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is provided with a small diameter portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> at a position a step lower than the end surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Also, a boss <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A is formed at the upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. When the upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is placed on top of the weld boss <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the boss <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A engages with the inner circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Further, when the upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is welded to the end surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by the ultrasonic welding, the end surface of the boss <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A abuts on the end surface of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, thereby limiting movement of the upper flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Thickness of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is partially increased by the provision of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> at the inner circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. However, the annular groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> provided in the bottom wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is utilized to reduce the thickness, the thickness of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>is made as even as possible, and thus sinking of the outer circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is disposed inside the reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is integrally molded by being inserted into a metal mold <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> for molding the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The metal mold <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> includes a fixed-side mold plate <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and a movable-side mold plate <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. The molding material is filled into a cavity <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> defined by the fixed-side mold plate <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and the movable-side mold plate <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> in a state in which the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is fixed to the fixed-side mold plate <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and the metal mold <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is clamped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> An annular depression <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is provided at one side of the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. When the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is attached at the fixed-side mold plate <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, an annular protrusion <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> formed at the fixed-side mold plate <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> fits in the annular depression <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, to position and fix the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to the fixed-side mold plate <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Further, an annular tapered portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is provided, as a joinable portion, at a peripheral portion of the one end side of the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. When the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is attached to the fixed-side mold plate <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, a gap is formed between the tapered portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the fixed-side mold plate <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. At the time of molding, the molding material flows into this gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> With this gap, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, an annular pawl portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, which serves as a joining portion joined to the outer circumference of the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, is formed at the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In this manner, by the pawl portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> joining to the tapered portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is united with the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by providing the annular tapered portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at the peripheral portion of the one end side of the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and joining the tapered portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> by the annular pawl portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, all cross-sectional forms of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> taken radially from the axis of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be made the same as each other. Therefore, flowing states of the molding material do not differ between circumferential direction positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In addition, since there is no need to provide the through-holes <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> in the metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>) as in the conventional technique, variations in the pressure of the molding material flowing over the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are small. Therefore, the residual stress can be reduced, improving accuracy of the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Further, flatness of the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Further, by providing the annular pawl portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> for joining the outer circumference of the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, internal dimensions of the portion for joining the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are larger than in the case of providing the through-holes <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> in the metal plate <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>), and air is easier to remove and less likely to be trapped. Thus, no wrinkles are caused on the reel hub <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the tapered portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is provided at the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to improve joint condition between the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for integration thereof. However, this is not intended to limit the present invention, what is required is simply that the metal plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is united with the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by insert molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an annular stepped portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>A, which serves as a joining portion, may be provided at an outer circumferential surface of a metal plate <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> so as to intrude into a reel hub <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. An annular rib <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>B may be provided standing from an outer circumferential surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> toward a movable-side mold plate of a metal mold (upward in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), and the stepped portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>A and the rib <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>B may be joined by an annular pawl portion <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Thus, the molding material is poured into a stepped portion defined by the stepped portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>A and the rib <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>B, and joint condition around the rib <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>B is improved by increasing contact area with the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, thus uniting the metal plate <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> with the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, simply by providing an annular rib <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>A (a joining portion) standing from an outer circumferential surface of a metal plate <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> toward a movable-side mold plate of a metal mold (upward in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) to join with the bottom wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> joining portion) of the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the metal plate <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can be joined with the lower flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, although a so-called single reel type, wherein one reel is accommodated in the magnetic tape cartridge, is described here, this is not intended to limit the present invention. A two-reel type, wherein two reels are accommodated in the magnetic tape cartridge, is also applicable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Next, a reel of a magnetic tape cartridge according to a second embodiment of the present invention is described. It should be noted that details of the magnetic tape cartridge according to the present embodiment are substantially the same as those of the magnetic tape cartridge according to the first embodiment, and therefore explanation thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, a reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, an upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and a lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> forming a reel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are separately molded Additionally, the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may be molded as a set. After the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> have been molded, the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are welded by ultrasonic welding to form the reel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>A, a collar <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> extends from a lower edge of an outer circumference of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. On an upper surface of the collar <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, a so-called weld boss <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which is fused by ultrasonic waves for welding to the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, is provided so as to project therefrom. A sectional form of the weld boss <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is substantially a triangle, so it can be fused easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> An internal diameter D<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is slightly larger than an external diameter D<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, so that a gap h is formed between an outer circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and an inner circumferential surface of the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> when the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is fitted on the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Further, the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is provided with a large diameter portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. An internal diameter of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is slightly larger than an external diameter of the collar <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, so that a gap t is formed between the collar <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> when the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is fitted on the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Because the gaps h and t are formed between the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, residue of the fused weld boss <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which is produced when the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are welded, runs into the gaps h and t. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, the residue of the welding material does not overflow onto the surfaces of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Further, the welding can be effected not only in an axial direction of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, but also in a circumferential direction thereof, thereby providing a good welding stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, an inner circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is provided with a small diameter portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> (stepped portion) at a position a step lower than the end surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. A weld boss <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is provided projecting from a top surface of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> A boss <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A is formed at the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. An external diameter of the boss <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A is slightly smaller than an internal diameter of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, so that a gap s is formed between an inner circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and an outer circumferential surface of the boss <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are welded, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>B, residue of the fused weld boss <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> runs into the gap s (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>). Therefore, the residue of the welding material does not run over onto the surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Further, by making the residue of the welding material run into the gap s formed between the inner circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the outer circumferential surface of the boss <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A, welding can be effected not only in the axial direction of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, but also in the circumferential direction thereof, thereby providing a good welding stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, although the residue of the fused weld boss <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> slightly overflows onto inner circumferential surfaces of the boss <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A and small diameter portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, this does not affect flatness of the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and roundness of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and therefore is not a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Next, a method for welding the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> First, for performing ultrasonic welding, a jig for fixing the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the like, which are placed on a stage of an ultrasonic welder (not shown), and a &lsquo;horn&rsquo; for transmitting vibrational energy generated by the ultrasonic welder to the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and to the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the jig <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> includes a hollow-cylindrical depression <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> whose internal diameter is substantially the same as external diameters of the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). A cylindrical shaft <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, whose external diameter is substantially the same as the internal diameter of the hole <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A formed in the bottom wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, is provided at the center of the annular depression <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> When the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are fitted in the annular depression <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is fitted on the shaft <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are coaxially aligned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> A lower flange horn <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is substantially cylindrical, and has a size such that it can fit around the outer circumference surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and face the collar <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. An upper flange horn <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference>) is also substantially cylindrical, and has an external diameter substantially the same as the external diameter of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and an internal diameter substantially the same as the internal diameter of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> When welding the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a load applied by the upper flange horn <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is received by the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and therefore no excessive load is applied to the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In this structure, the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is fitted on the shaft <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the jig <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is fitted in the annular depression <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A, a</cross-reference> ceiling portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>A formed by the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is abutted against the top of the weld boss <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> formed at the collar <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In this state, the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are coaxially positioned. Therefore, the axes of the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are kept aligned in spite of the presence of the gaps h and t formed between the outer circumferential surfaces of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the inner circumferential surfaces of the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, the lower flange horn <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the ultrasonic welder is abutted on the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and the vibrational energy generated by the ultrasonic welder is transmitted to the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> via the lower flange horn <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Thus, frictional heat is generated between the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and the weld boss <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>) is fused to weld the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Next, the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is welded to the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). The upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is fitted in the annular depression <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the jig <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, the end surface of the boss <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A of the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is abutted against the top of the weld boss <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> formed at the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, to which the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> has already been welded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In this state, the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are coaxially positioned. Therefore, the axes of the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are kept aligned in spite of the presence of the gap s formed between the inner circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the outer circumferential surface of the boss <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>B, the upper flange horn <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is abutted on the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Thus, the weld boss <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> (see Fig, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A) is fused to weld the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, thereby forming the reel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As described above, by welding the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, which are separately molded, the highly accurate reel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be easily formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In other words, the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be separately molded. This allows selection of a suitable gating system (such as disc gates) and setting of optimal molding conditions for each of the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> depending on the shapes thereof. Thus, flatness of the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be improved, and at the same time roundness of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can also be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> By welding, the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be united with certainty and without backlash, as compared with the case in which the lower flange and the hub are provided with pawl portions to be fitted with each other, and can be united more simply as compared with the case in which the flange and the hub are threaded and screwed together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that although the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are separately welded to the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, welding between the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and between the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may be performed simultaneously by fitting the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in the annular depression <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in this order and then abutting the upper flange horn <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> on the upper flange <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. However, in this case, slight modifications are required to a generated frequency setting of the ultrasonic welder, to the shape of the horn, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Further, although the collar <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is extended from the outer circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for welding to the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, the shape is not limited to the shape in this embodiment; all that is required is that the lower flange <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be welded to the reel hub <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> neatly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference>, a small diameter portion <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is provided at an outer circumferential lower edge of a hub <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, a small diameter flange <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is provided at a lower flange <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> extending from an inner circumferential surface thereof, and a weld boss <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is provided projecting from the small diameter flange <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Further, an internal diameter D<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the lower flange <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is slightly larger than an external diameter D<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the hub <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. When the hub <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> is fitted in the lower flange <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a gap h<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is formed between the outer circumferential surface of the hub <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and the inner circumferential surface of the lower flange <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. Also an internal diameter of the small diameter flange <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of the lower flange <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is slightly larger than an external diameter of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> of the hub <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, and when the hub <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> is fitted in the lower flange <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a gap t<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is formed between the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> of the hub <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and the small diameter flange <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of the lower flange <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the hub <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are welded together, residue of the fused weld boss <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference>) runs into the gaps h<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference>, by providing a small diameter portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> (stepped portion) at an outer circumferential lower edge of a hub <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, providing a weld boss <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> projecting from a ceiling surface <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> formed by a small diameter portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and welding a top surface <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>A of a lower flange <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> thereto, so that there is no gap formed in an area of an outer circumferential surface of the hub <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, where magnetic tape will be wound, a risk of edges of the magnetic tape coming into such a gap can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In this structure, a gap t<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is formed between the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the hub <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and an inner circumferential surface of the lower flange <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, so that residue of the fused weld boss <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> runs into the gap t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, the weld boss <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> provided at the ceiling surface <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> must be disposed near the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, so that the residue of the fused weld boss <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> does not overflow onto the outer circumferential surface of the hub <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> As described above, in order to eliminate the risk of the edge of the magnetic tape coming into a gap, what is required is simply that no gap is formed in the area of the outer circumferential surface of the hub <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> where the magnetic tape is wound. Therefore, the shape is not limited to the above structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</cross-reference>, a depression <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> is provided between a small diameter portion <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> (stepped portion) provided at a hub <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and a ceiling surface <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. A projection <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, which can be accommodated in the depression <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, is provided at a lower flange <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> so that the projection <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is accommodated in the depression <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> when the lower flange <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is welded to the hub <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and a gap t<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is formed between the projection <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and the depression <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure that residue of a weld boss <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> provided at the ceiling surface <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> runs into the gap t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, the weld boss <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> is provided near the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Next, a reel of a magnetic tape cartridge according to a third embodiment of the present invention is described. It should be noted that details of the magnetic tape cartridge according to the present embodiment are substantially the same as those of the magnetic tape cartridge according to the first embodiment, and therefore explanation thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>, a reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (core) and a lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> forming a reel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are integrally molded. The lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is provided with an annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> outside the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. A metal sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, which serves as a hub, can be fitted in the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> so as to sheathe the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> A height of the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is less than a height of the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and a tip of the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> sticks out from the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> when the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is fitted in the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> A weld boss <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> for ultrasonic welding having a substantially triangular sectional form is provided so as to project from an end surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. By fusing the weld boss <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> with ultrasonic waves in a state in which an upper flange <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is placed on the top of the weld boss <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the upper flange <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is welded to the end surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, to form the reel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> A boss <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>A is formed at the upper flange <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> When the upper flange <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is placed on the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the boss <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>A faces the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> formed at the lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and an outer circumferential surface of the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is disposed in line with an outer circumferential surface of the boss <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> When the upper flange <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is welded to the end surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> by ultrasonic welding as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference>, the end surface of the boss <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>A abuts on the end surface of the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is fixed by the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the boss <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>A, and the outer circumferential surface of the boss <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>A and the outer circumferential surface of the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> become substantially flush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Because the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is disposed at the outer circumferential surface of the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, a gap is formed between the inner circumferential surface of the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and the outer circumferential surface of the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. However, because the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is fixed by the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the boss <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>A, the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> does not rattle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In the structure described above, the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is disposed outside the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is wound on the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is caused to incline by thermal contraction after molding of the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, this inclination will not affect winding of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As a result, a highly accurate hub can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Further, thermal contraction after the molding is effected along radial directions of the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> follows the thermal contraction of the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. By providing the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> at the lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> on a concentric circle thereof, and fitting the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> in the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, the axis of the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is aligned with axes of the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the axis of the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> does not deviate with respect to the lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> In a conventional structure, if a reel hub <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is inclined by thermal contraction of the reel hub <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and a lower flange <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>), the inclination of the reel hub <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> will affect winding of a magnetic tape, and therefore such reels have been considered defective. However, by placing the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> outside (around) the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, yield is improved and this leads to a cost reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that although the lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is provided with the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is fitted around the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and fitted in the annular depression <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> after the lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> are molded, other structures can also be used, as long as they can provide a highly accurate hub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> For example, by inserting the metal sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> in a metal mold for molding the lower flange <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, these may be integrally molded such that the sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is positioned outside the reel hub <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Since the metal sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> has a lower coefficient of linear expansion than synthetic resins, it hardly deforms at all compared with synthetic resins. Therefore, a highly accurate hub can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> However, the sleeve is not limited to the metal sleeve <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and may be made of any material whose melting temperature is higher than that of the core and the lower flange, and which does not melt when the core and the lower flange are molded. Therefore, the sleeve may be made of a synthetic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference>, by providing a small diameter portion <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>A at one end side of an outer circumference of a sleeve <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, fitting the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>A in an annular depression <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> of a lower flange <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, and abutting a ceiling portion between the outer circumferential surface of the sleeve <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>A on the lower flange <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the risk of the edge of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) coming into a gap formed between the outer circumferential surface of the sleeve <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the annular depression <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Further, a small diameter portion <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>B may be provided at an inner circumference at the other end side of the sleeve <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and a boss <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>A of an upper flange <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> may be positioned at the inner circumference side of the sleeve <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. In this structure, the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is wound only on the sleeve <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if the size of the boss <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>A of the upper flange <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is irregular, winding of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will not be affected. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The braking member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is provided for preventing rotation of a reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> when a magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is not in use. The braking member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> has a substantial L shape viewed from above. The braking member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is supported rotatably with a lower portion of a supporting shaft <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> at the middle of the braking member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> being fitted, with play, around a protrusion (not shown) provided at the lower case <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, and a substantially cylindrical protrusion <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>A provided at an upper portion of the supporting shaft <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> being fitted, with play, in a boss <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>A provided projecting from an inner surface of an upper case <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the pitch of the reel gear <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the braking gear <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is usually in a range from 1 to 3.5 mm, and more usually from 2.5 to 3 mm. This pitch makes the reel gear <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the braking gear <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> resistant to breakage, and unintended rotation of the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be assuredly prevented preferably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Since the reel gear <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is provided at the outer circumferential portion of the lower flange <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and the braking gear <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> engages with the reel gear <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to effect braking, there is no need to provide the reel gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) at a top surface of a bottom wall <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> of the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Therefore, molding accuracy of the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> When the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is mounted in the drive <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, an engaging member (not shown) provided at the drive <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> enters the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> and pushes the engaging portion <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> of the braking member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, thereby rotating the braking gear <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> on the supporting shaft <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, against the urging force of the torsion spring <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>, in a direction in which meshing between the braking gear <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the reel gear <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Next, operation of the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> having the above-described structure is explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> When the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is not in use, unintended rotation of the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is prevented by the braking member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. Namely, the braking gear <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> urged by the torsion spring <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> meshes with the reel gear <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> formed at the lower flange <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to prevent unintended rotation of the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is to be used, it is mounted in a bucket (not shown) of the drive <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. When the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is mounted in the bucket, the bucket moves downward and a rotation shaft <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the drive <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> moves relatively closer to the opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Then, the substantially cylindrical mesh-release pin <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> provided at the center of the distal end of the rotating shaft <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> enters the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> through a hole <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>A in a reel plate <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, abuts on a projection <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> of a spring seat <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, and via the projection <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, pushes the spring seat <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> upward against the urging force of the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The magnet (not shown) disposed at the distal end of the rotating shaft <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> except at the mesh-release pin <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> attracts and holds the reel plate <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, and the reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is meshed with the driving gear <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> while the center of rotation is preferably secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> At this time, the engaging member (not shown) enters the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> and pushes the engaging portion <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> to rotate the braking gear <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> against the urging force of the torsion spring <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to a non-meshing position, thereby releasing the meshing between the braking gear <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the reel gear <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Thus, rotation of the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is permitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the pulling pin (not shown) provided at the drive <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is engaged with a depression <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> of the leader block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> attached at the end of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and pulls the leader block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> out of the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Then, the leader block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is fitted to a reel hub of a winding reel (not shown) at the drive <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> such that the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be wound on the winding reel. The reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the winding reel are driven to rotate synchronously to wind the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the winding reel sequentially, and at this time data is written on or read from the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> When the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been completely wound up on the winding reel, the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the winding reel are driven to rotate in a reverse direction, to wind the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. When the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been completely wound up on the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the leader block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is pulled out of the reel hub and is locked at an opening <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> of the magnetic tape cartridge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Then, the magnetic force of the magnet is turned off, releasing the attraction between the magnet and the reel plate <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, the rotating shaft <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is moved downward to release the meshing between the reel gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the driving gear <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and the mesh-release pin <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> is pulled out from the hole <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>A in the reel plate <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Thus, the spring seat <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> is pushed downward by the urging force of the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Also the engaging member is retracted from the opening <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> formed in the lower case <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, releasing the pressure applied onto the engaging portion <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. Thus, the braking gear <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is meshed with the reel gear <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> by the urging force of the torsion spring <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to prevent unintended rotation of the reel <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, although in this embodiment the reel gear <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is provided at the outer circumferential portion of the lower flange <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and is engaged with the braking gear <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, a braking reel gear may be provided at the upper flange <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and for engaging with a braking member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In the invention exemplified by the first embodiment, by forming the hub so that sectional forms thereof taken radially from the axis thereof are the same, flowing states of the molding material at the respective cross-section positions can be made the same at the respective cross-sectional positions. Therefore, the flowing state of the molding material does not differ with circumferential direction position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Often in the invention, by joining the outer circumference of the inserted metal plate to the end of the hub by an annular joining device, sectional forms of the hub taken radially from the axis can be made the same as each other. Further, since there is no need to provide holes or the like in the metal plate, as there has been in prior arts, variations in the pressure of the molding material flowing over the metal plate are small. Therefore, residual stress can be reduced, thereby improving accuracy of the hub and flatness of the flange. Furthermore, by joining at the outer circumference of the metal plate, the internal dimensions of the portion joining the metal plate are increased compared with the case in which the metal plate is provided with holes. This means air is removed easily and is less likely to be retained. Thus, no wrinkles are created on the hub and the flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Often in the invention, the joining portion is formed as an annular pawl portion. Therefore, the metal plate is prevented from detaching. In the invention, the metal plate can be firmly fixed to the hub. Also, the metal plate can be fixed within the metal mold with certainty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> In the invention exemplified by the second embodiment, the hub and the flange are separately molded. This allows selection of a suitable gating system (e.g., disc gates) and setting of optimal molding conditions for each shape. Therefore, compared with the case in which the hub and the flange are integrally molded, variations in pressure at the hub can be reduced and flatness of the flange can be improved. Further, roundness of the hub can be improved together with the improvement in the flatness of the flange. Moreover, by welding, the hub and the flange can be united with certainty and without backlash, compared with the case in which the flange and the hub are provided with pawl portions for fitting to each other, and can be united more simply compared with the case in which the flange and the hub are threaded and screwed together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Often in the invention, by providing a first weld boss and a second weld boss projecting from the welding surfaces, the first weld boss and the second weld boss fuse to weld the flanges to the hub when frictional heat is generated between the flanges and the hub by vibrational energy of an ultrasonic welder. Therefore, compared with the case in which no weld boss is provided, these parts can be welded together more firmly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Often in the invention, by forming a gap between the inner circumferential surface of the flange and the outer circumferential surface of the collar and the hub, and making residue from the welding surface run into the gap, the residue of the welding can be prevented from running onto the surface of the flange. In the invention, a gap may be formed between the wall surface of the stepped portion and the outer circumferential surface of a boss provided at the inner circumferential portion of the flange, and the residue of the second weld boss made to run into the gap there. Also, the edges of the recording tape can be prevented from entering such gaps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> In the invention exemplified by the third embodiment, the hub is placed outside the core and the recording tape is wound on the hub. Therefore, even if the core is inclined due to thermal contraction after molding of the core and the lower flange, the inclination does not affect the winding of the recording tape, and a highly accurate hub can be obtained as a result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Often in the invention, during the thermal contraction after the molding, the thermal contraction is effected along the radial directions of the core and the lower flange. Therefore, an annular depression follows the thermal contraction of the core and the lower flange. By providing the annular depression at the lower flange on a concentric circle thereof, and fitting a sleeve of the hub in the annular depression, the axis of the sleeve is aligned with axes of the core and the lower flange. Therefore, the axis of the sleeve does not deviate with respect to the lower flange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Often in the invention, a shoulder portion between a small diameter portion and a large diameter portion abuts on the lower flange. Therefore, even if a gap is formed between the small diameter portion and the annular depression, the recording tape does not come into the gap. More usually in the invention, a labor for attaching the sleeve after the molding of the core and the lower flange can be saved. Therefore, production processes can be reduced, thereby reducing production costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Often in the invention, since a metal has a lower coefficient of linear expansion than synthetic resins and hardly deforms, use of the metal sleeve provides a highly accurate hub. More usually in the invention, the recording tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is wound only on the sleeve. Therefore, even if the size is irregular at engaging portion which engages with the sleeve at the upper flange or the lower flange, this does not affect the winding of the recording tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> In the invention exemplified by the fourth embodiment, by providing a braking gear at the outer circumference of the flange to effect braking, unintended rotation of the reel when the recording tape cartridge is not in use can be prevented with certainty. Further, compared with the case in which the braking gear is provided at the core side of the flange, the required braking force is smaller and the pitch of the braking gear can be increased. Therefore, failures such as breakage of the braking gear are not caused. Moreover, since the braking gear is not provided at the core side of the flange, molding accuracy of the reel can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Often in the invention, since a braking member urged by an urging device meshed with the braking gear when a driving gear is not meshed with a rotation gear, the reel cannot rotate in this state. When the driving gear meshes with the rotation gear, the braking member can be pushed against the urging force of the urging device and the engagement between the braking member and the braking gear released. Thereafter, driving force from the driving gear is transmitted to the reel rotation gear to rotate the reel. Usually in the invention, the braking gear does not easily break. </paragraph>
