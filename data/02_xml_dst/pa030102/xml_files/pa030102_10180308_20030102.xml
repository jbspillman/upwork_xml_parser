<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">There is disclosed a test apparatus with probes for checking the proper working of semiconductor devices (<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) immediately after their manufacture. More precisely, such systems are provided with particular probes (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), in that they include at least two tips (<highlight><bold>8, 9, 18, 29</bold></highlight>) at their end, which enters into contact with the contact bumps (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of said semiconductor devices during the test phases.

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns a test device, more particularly a conductive test probe, capable of being arranged on a test device for testing the electric features of semiconductor devices, one end of which is provided in order to be connected to an electrically conductive path of said test device and the second end of which is capable of contacting contact bumps of said semiconductor devices during said tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This type of test device or probe card is commonly used by semiconductor manufacturers to test the proper working of their finished products such as wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example of this type of semiconductor device. A wafer can be seen in this Figure, on which four columns of integrated circuits will simultaneously be tested across two rows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the reference <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> designates a wafer of semiconductor devices including a plurality of integrated circuits <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is an enlarged view of the eight integrated circuits referenced in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, shows schematically a test phase. A test device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be seen, arranged above wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Said test device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes test probes <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> connected, via a support <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, mechanically to a substrate <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> generally made of resin, and electrically to electric conduction paths <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> carried by said substrate <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. These electric conduction paths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are used to establish the electrical connection between test probes <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and an electronic test circuit (not shown). Said substrate <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> further includes an aperture <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> through which said probes <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> pass, so as to contact contact bumps <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, arranged on said wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in order to carry out various tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The test devices disclosed in the prior art have restrictive drawbacks. In order to carry out the test measurements, probes <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> have to be fixed onto device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with a very high level of precision. Typically, said probes are initially positioned and fixed manually as a function of the positions of contact bumps <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, arranged on wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which constitutes laborious work. Moreover, when the tests are carried out, said probes <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are subjected to more or less significant successive deformations which may be permanent (non resilient) when the contacts are established with said bumps, as shown by the arrows marked P in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is a cross-section along the line III-III of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. These pressures lead to deformation of the probes, which may be more or less significant depending on the cross-section of said probes and the resilient properties of the material used to manufacture them. Moreover, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, when the density of contact bumps <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> on the semiconductor wafers to be tested is high, it is necessary to provide several rows of test probes on the same device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Consequently, since certain probes <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> are longer than others <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, they do not undergo the same mechanical stresses via the effect of the pressure exerted during the tests and thus are not deformed in the same way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When these deformations reach a certain amplitude, there is a risk that probes <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are no longer aligned with bumps <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> which they have to contact. Moreover, a quick visual check of the alignment is not possible without an optical instrument given the small dimensions of the probes and contact bumps. Consequently, this type of test device or probe card, which is expensive to manufacture, is fragile and expensive to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,016,061 discloses a particular test probe structure, one end of which includes a plurality of contact zones, each having a reduced contact surface with respect to the end of conventional test probes, with a view to limiting the damage caused to the contact pads or bumps tested. This probe structure does not allow the different contact zones to move in relation to each other. Thus, during use, the different contact zones all deform in the same direction with the same amplitude and this solution does not allow the problem described hereinbefore to be resolved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Solutions have been proposed in the prior art to overcome these difficulties. The most immediate of these solutions, which is also far from being the most interesting, consists in avoiding reducing the dimensions of the contact bumps on the semiconductor devices too much with respect to the probes. This arrangement allows the manufacturer to have more significant tolerances for the deformations which the probes may undergo during the test steps. This solution is not suited to current semiconductor industry requirements, one of the main objects of which is to optimise the space used for manufacturing its products and thus to reduce the dimensions of the contact bumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another solution proposed consists in using a more or less rigid membrane which the probes pass through and which maintains the position of their second ends. U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,778 discloses such a device using a membrane made of resin or silicon. Said membrane preferably has a certain resilience for absorbing deformations due to the contact pressure of the probes on the contact bumps of semiconductor devices to be tested. This solution has, however, a drawback, in that the structure of the card assembly is particular and more complex than those of the prior art, requiring a different manufacturing process to those existing to be implemented. Moreover, said structure limits the compatibility of the components with the conventional components used on other probe cards that are already available on the market. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The main object of the present invention is thus to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of the prior art by providing a test probe which can be adapted on existing probe cards to test semiconductor devices, able, in particular, to hold its position well over time with respect to the contact bumps of said semiconductor devices. This advantageously allows a reliable contact to be maintained with the bumps despite any deformation undergone by the probes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention therefore concerns a test probe of the aforementioned type, characterised in that said probe includes, from its second end towards its first end, at least two branches joining to form a rod-like portion and capable of simultaneously contacting the same contact bump via their free ends which each ends in a pointed tip, the branches and the rod portion forming a single electric conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the probability that the probe according to the invention contacts the desired contact bump on the semiconductor device is greater than in the case of the probes of the prior art, in particular after they have been subjected to possible deformations. Indeed, as was already indicated hereinbefore, during testing of semiconductor devices, the test probes tend to become deformed because of the pressure to which they are subjected. With a probe of the type of those known in the prior art, when the deformation amplitude reaches a certain value, it may happen that the probe is no longer properly positioned with respect to the contact bump which it has to contact. With a probe according to the invention, for the same deformation amplitude, it may also happen that one of said at least two tips is no longer properly positioned. However, since the second tip is initially positioned at a different place on the bump than the place contacted by the first tip, the probability that said second tip is still properly positioned to contact said desired contact bump, is greater. It may be noted that, since said two tips are electrically connected to each other directly within the test probe, there is equivalence from the test point of view if the contact with a bump of the semiconductor device to be tested is established respectively by the first or by the second of said two tips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Consequently, whereas a probe according to the prior art requires a maintenance operation, the probe according to the present invention still fulfills its function properly. As the period separating two successive maintenance operations is increased compared with that of the prior art, the economic advantage of the test probe according to the invention is obvious. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as the tolerances allowed on the deformation of the probes according to the invention are greater than in the case of the probes of the prior art, the semiconductor device manufacturer can reduce the size of the contact bumps which are made on said devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention also concerns several methods for manufacturing said test probe, allowing, via different ways, a test probe to be obtained whose second end includes at least two tips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A first method includes the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> a) obtaining or manufacturing two longilineal elements made in an electrically conductive material, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> b) adjusting the cross-section of said longilineal elements, by a wire drawing type operation, to obtain the desired cross-section, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> c) partially connecting said longilineal elements lengthwise, by a welding, soldering or bonding operation, using an electrically conductive adhesive, from a first of their respective ends so as to define said rod, their respective free ends being kept separated so as to define said two branches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Another method proposed in accordance with the present invention includes the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> a) obtaining or manufacturing a sheet of electrically conductive material the thickness of which substantially corresponds to the desired diameter for said test probe; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> b) cutting out said probe directly in said sheet by laser cutting, chemical means or photoetching, so that said rod and said branches are made in a single piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The invention also concerns a method for positioning test probes, in accordance with the present invention, on a probe card and relative to the positions of contact bumps arranged on a semiconductor device to be tested before commencing said tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The structure and methods according to the invention thus advantageously allow semiconductor devices to be tested in series, generally integrated circuits arranged on wafers, while increasing the duration between two checks and successive position adjustments of the probes compared to devices of the prior art.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A probe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a structure according to the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, as it enters into contact with a contact bump <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a semiconductor device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A first end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of said probe is typically connected to a probe card via a support-ring made of resin (not shown). This aspect will not be developed here in more detail insofar as it forms part of the general knowledge of those skilled in the art, like the detailed structure of said probe card which is of a conventional type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Starting from said first end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, probe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a first substantially rectilinear portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> ending in a bent portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the whole defining a rod. Two substantially rectilinear branches <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, having different respective angles with respect to said first rectilinear portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, extend from said bent portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Said two rectilinear branches <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> thus define two tips <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, substantially located in a same horizontal plane, and capable of contacting contact bumps <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of semiconductor devices <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Typically, the test probes according to the invention are made with materials commonly used in the prior art, such as tungsten or a copper beryllium alloy (CuBe). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As regards the manufacture of said probes, several methods can be envisaged. One can first of all adapt a method usually used for making test probes of the prior art, i.e. make a metal wire of the desired cross-section by a wire drawing operation, making a cut at one of the ends of said wire lengthwise so as to obtain two branches then bending or folding said two branches with different respective angles, preferably slightly less than 90 degrees. One may of course imagine that, for example, the angle applied to one of said branches is less than 90 degrees whereas the angle applied to the second of said branches is slightly greater than 90 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> One may also manufacture such test probes starting from a metal sheet of a thickness corresponding to the section desired for the probe, said sheet being cut along the profile of the test probe so as to obtain said probe directly without any additional operations. Said cutting can be achieved, for example, by laser etching, chemical means or by a photoetching method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Two additional methods which can be envisaged to make said probes consist in using welding, soldering or bonding methods using an electrically conductive adhesive. One may, on the one hand, start with a test probe as known in the prior art onto which a second branch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is fixed at the bent end, thus defining a second tip <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, by one of the aforementioned methods. One may, on the other hand, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, start with two probes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as known in the prior art and preferably with smaller sections than the usual sections, which are fixed to each other, by one of the aforementioned methods. The junction made between said two probes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is designated by the reference <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In this latter case, a first of said probes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is selected to be shorter than the other <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and its branch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, carrying tip <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which is capable of being put into contact with contact bumps <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during tests, is bent or folded at a greater angle, with respect to first rectilinear portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, than the corresponding branch <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, carrying tip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, of the second of said probes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this way, said respective branches <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of said probes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are separated and the assembly obtained thus defines a single probe including two tips <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Furthermore and in accordance with the invention, the distance between said two branches <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is determined from the dimensions of contact bumps <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be tested, so that said two tips <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can initially simultaneously contact the same contact bump <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As was indicated previously, during the tests of the semiconductor devices, the test probes undergo more or less significant pressure which causes their deformation. The probes are positioned on a probe card via a support so that their tips, which are capable of contacting the contact bumps, are substantially situated in a same horizontal plane. The card is then generally brought closer to the semiconductor devices to be tested from the top downwards (shown by arrows A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) until the probes enter into contact with said bumps. However, the contact bumps on the semiconductor devices are of variable height, which is why the probe card is lowered more than is actually necessary, to ensure that all the probes actually establish contact with the corresponding contact bump on the semiconductor device to be tested. Consequently, the test probes undergo more or less significant pressure depending on the real height of the corresponding contact bump. Said probes consequently tend to become deformed and transmit said pressure to the probe card, which is thus also capable of deforming to finally have a surface evenness defect. The fact that the probe card is lowered closer to the semiconductor device than actually necessary is also intended to compensate for the gradual deformation of the probes and the probe card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When one examines more precisely the deformation which the test probes undergo, it can be seen that they can result in the establishment of a poor contact with the corresponding bump, or no contact at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> This is why, as is apparent in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when the test probe according to the invention is deformed until one of the two tips <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can no longer contact the corresponding bump <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the second tip <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> still guarantees contact. One may in fact consider that, as a first approximation, according to the structure of the probe in accordance with the invention, said first tip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> corresponds to the single tip of a probe of the prior art. Thus, when a probe of the prior art is deformed to the point of requiring an awkward maintenance operation, the probe according to the present invention can still operate properly owing to the presence of said second tip <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It may also be noted that, because of the distance separating the junction of the branches of their respective tips, the branches are capable of being deformed differently to each other, i.e. in different directions and with different respective deformation amplitudes. Thus, when one of tips <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> undergoes a significant deformation, for example to the point of no longer being aligned with the contact bump which it has to test, it is possible for the other tip not to be deformed, or only very slightly and to be aligned still with said contact bump. This particular feature is advantageous from the point of view of utilisation costs, since it statistically allows the period separating two successive maintenance operations of the test probes according to the present invention to be extended compared to the probes of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Starting from this principle, one can deduce therefrom a method for optimising the initial position of probe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the invention, i.e. before the start of tests and thus of deformations, on the probe card (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). In order to do this, account must be taken of the dimensions and the position of the corresponding contact bump <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the semiconductor device to be tested. As has already been mentioned, the distance between the two branches <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of probe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the invention also depends on the dimensions of the bumps to be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a top view of a contact bump <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on which are schematised the orthogonal projections <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of said tips <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of probe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the invention. It can be said, in a certain way, that tips <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> must preferably be centred on contact bump <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, insofar as the direction of the deformations is random, both for the probe and for each of its branches. Indeed, the only tendency which can be deduced from practice indicates that the most significant deformations occur in the direction shown by the double arrow referenced X in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the case of a contact bump <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of substantially rectangular shape and of length referenced L in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, chosen here by way of non limiting example, the test probe will preferably be positioned so that the centre Cl of said projection <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of a first of tips <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is located substantially at a distance L/<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the small side <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of bump <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is the closest to said tip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the distance arranged between said two tips <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of probe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will preferably be chosen such that the centre C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of said projection <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the second of said tips <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is also located at a distance L/<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the other small side <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of said contact bump <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In other words, the centre of the segment defined by C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> preferably coincides with the geometric centre C of the contact bump. Since this configuration has the best guarantee of contact between the probe and the corresponding successive bumps over time, it constitutes a preferred embodiment for the method for positioning the probe on a probe card according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, owing to the present invention, a manufacturer of semiconductor devices can advantageously reduce the dimensions of the contact bumps arranged on said devices and thus reduce the global size of said devices. This reduction allows said manufacturer to use less raw material for manufacturing said devices, which constitutes a main advantage of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The preceding description corresponds to preferred embodiments of the invention and should in no way be considered as limitative, as regards more particularly, the shape, inclination and materials described for the test probe, the manufacturing methods and the described shape of the contact bumps. </paragraph>
