<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus such as personal computers and a power management method of the information processing apparatus, particularly to an information processing apparatus having a plurality of devices and a power management method for managing a power of the plurality of devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, in portable information processing apparatuses such as a notebook-type personal computer, various power management functions are provided for the purpose of lengthening an operating time by a battery. When the power management function is executed, power consumption of various devices such as a CPU, video adapter, hard disk drive, and modem can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A user can set desired power management functions to be executed by a system. Thereby, the user can select a power management control in which an operation capability has priority, or a power management control in which the power saving has priority. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, a conventional system in which the user sets power management function beforehand in this manner has the following two problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 1) The user has to determine an operating status of an information processing apparatus, and has to perform a setting operation of the power management in accordance with the environment, so that the setting operation becomes complicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 2) A set value determined by the user is only based on a user&apos;s sense, and it is impossible to determine whether the setting is optimum. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to method and apparatus that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the present invention, an information processing apparatus having a device, comprises a storage unit configured to store characteristic information indicating a past operating status of the device; and a controller configured to control a power management of the device based on the characteristic information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, an optimum power management control can automatically be executed in accordance with an operating status of the information processing apparatus.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">First Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a constitution of the information processing apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the information processing apparatus is a portable computer such as a notebook-type personal computer, and can be operated by a battery. The information processing apparatus is roughly divided into a hardware unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a software unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The hardware unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of devices (&num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to &num;N) <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-N. Examples of the devices <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-N include a CPU, memory, chip set, video adapter, hard disk drive, display monitor, USB controller, IEEE 1394 I/F controller, modem, LAN controller, and radio communication module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The software unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> comprises a system software <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, user application <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, user setting tool <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and the like. The system software <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is a program group for controlling the hardware unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, such as an operating system and utility program. A plurality of device drivers (&num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to &num;N) <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-N, a power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and the like are provided. The device drivers (&num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to &num;N) <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-N manage and control the plurality of corresponding devices (&num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to &num;N) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N. In this case, one device driver may manage plural devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a program for performing the power management control of the information processing apparatus, and controls operating speeds of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N or an on/off of a power supply in accordance with a set value for a power saving control designated by a user. Examples of the set value include 1) the operating speed of the CPU (clock frequency of the CPU), 2) time required from when an idle state is detected until the power supply of the corresponding device is turned off, and 3) designation of a use device and a nonuse device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> also has a function (optimization mode) of optimizing the set value for the power saving control. In the optimization mode, even when the user does not perform an operation of designating the set value for the power saving control, the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> automatically selects the optimum value. To realize the function, the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> detects the present operating status of the hardware unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at a constant time interval. In a detection method, information is obtained from the device drivers <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-N corresponding to the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N, or the information is obtained directly from the devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N if necessary. Thereby, it is possible to grasp a tendency of operating status of each of the devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> predicts the set value for an optimum power saving control based on the tendency of the past operating status of the information processing apparatus every predetermined time period (e.g., every five minutes), and controls the set value for the power saving control based on the predicted result. That is, the system predicts the future operating status of the devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N, determines the set value for the power saving control, and controls the operating speeds of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N or the on/off of the power supply based on the determined set value. Even in this case, similarly as during the obtaining of the information, the system sets the value via the device drivers <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-N corresponding to the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N, or directly controls the devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The user-setting tool <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is an interface for allowing the user to designate the set value for the power saving control. Moreover, by using the user-setting tool <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, one of the optimization mode for automatically performing the power saving control, and a user-setting mode for performing the power saving control in accordance with the user setting can be selected. Even when the optimization mode is selected, the user can use the user-setting tool <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to freely set the individual set values again. </paragraph>

The power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> includes a management/ control unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, inferring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, learning unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The management/control unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> performs a power management control, has an interface with the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N and device drivers <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-N, and also has an interface with the user via the user setting tool <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. This management/control unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> executes the obtaining of operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N and the power management control of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The inferring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> predicts the set value for the optimum power saving control based on characteristic information that indicates the past operating status of the information processing apparatus for every predetermined time period and is stored in the database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> predicts the future operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N for a next time period based on the present operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N, and the past operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N which is indicated by the characteristic information. The predicted result is notified to the management/control unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and the power management control is executed based on the predicted result by the management/control unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The learning unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> learns the operating status of the information processing apparatus, and generates the above-described characteristic information. That is, the learning unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> analyzes the history of the past operating status of the information processing apparatus, which is obtained by the management/control unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and stored in the database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the leaning unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> generates the characteristic information indicating the tendency of the operating status of each of the device drivers <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-N for every predetermined time period and stores the characteristic information into the database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Characteristic Information </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows one example of the characteristic information stored in the database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The characteristic information has time scales &ldquo;month&rdquo;, &ldquo;day of the week&rdquo;, and &ldquo;time&rdquo;, and the operating status of the respective device drivers <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>-N, and weight values are registered for every predetermined time period (e.g., every five minutes) designated by the time scales. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> For example, in an example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is shown that a time period from time 8:00 to 8:05 on Monday (MON) in June, the device &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fully used (100%), the device &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not used at all (0%), and the device &num;N is partly used (20%). It is shown that a time period from time 9:00 to 9:05 on Monday (MON) in June, all the devices &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to &num;N are partly used (20%). The operating statuses of the respective devices are represented by numeric values of 0 to 100% so that the tendency of the operating status (use amount of resource) of the CPU or memory can also be recorded. Depending on the device, there are sometimes only two states ON and OFF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A weight value indicates a frequency of occurrence of the corresponding status. That is, it can be assumed that with a larger weight value, a probability of occurrence of the corresponding operating status increases at the point of time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Operating Status of Devices </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C show one example of a change of the operating status of each of the devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N. When the same user uses the information processing apparatus, the operating status of each device depends on a user&apos;s action pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For example, assuming that the user goes to work at 8:00 and leaves work at 17:00, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the operating status of the devices such as the CPU, memory, and LAN of the information processing apparatus has a large value between 8:00 and 17:00, but the value of the operating status extremely drops before 8:00 and after 17:00. On the other hand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, some devices such as the IEEE 1394 I/F, and modem are hardly used between 8:00 and 17:00. Furthermore, when the user comes home, the user uses the devices such as the IEEE 1394 I/F and modem in many cases. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, the value of the operating status sometimes rises after 17:00. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Moreover, working days of Monday through Friday have the above-described tendency, but Saturday and Sunday sometimes have the operating status very different from those of Monday through Friday. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the above-described characteristic information is generated and recorded which indicates the tendency of the operating status of each device with the time scales of the &ldquo;month&rdquo;, &ldquo;day of the week&rdquo;, and &ldquo;time&rdquo;. Thereby, it is possible to highly precisely predict the operating status of each device by the day of the week and time period from the characteristic information. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A procedure of a power management control processing executed by the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> during the optimization mode will next be described with reference to a flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is started, when the user turns on the power supply of the information processing apparatus (step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). A flow of the processing to be executed differs with the previous system status. Therefore, the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> first determines whether the previous system status is a sleep state or a power off (shutdown) state (step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). Here, the sleep state means that a system context necessary for restoring a system-operating environment is saved in a main memory or a hard disk, and subsequently the power supply of the system is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the sleep state, the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> executes a resume processing of restoring the system context and restoring the system-operating environment just before the power off (step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). In the power off (shutdown) state, a usual boot up processing for starting the operating system is executed (step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The information processing apparatus is brought into an operative state in this manner. While the information processing apparatus is in the operative state, the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> repeatedly executes the following processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> first searches the database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to find characteristic information corresponding to the present time period and a succeeding time period (steps S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). If it is 8:02, Monday of June, characteristic information corresponding to the present time period from 8:00 to 8:05 and the succeeding time period from <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>:<highlight><bold>05</bold></highlight> to 8:10 is found. If it is 9:04, Monday of June, characteristic information corresponding to the succeeding time period from 9:05 to 9:10 is not found. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When the characteristic information is found (YES in step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> detects the present operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N (step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>). The system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> predicts the operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N for the succeeding time period based on the detected present operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N and the characteristic information in the database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> indicating the past operating status corresponding to the present time period and the succeeding time period, and determines the set value for the optimum power saving control for each of the devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N (steps S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> For example, when the detected operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N agrees with the past operating status corresponding to the present time period, it can be assumed that the past operating status corresponding to the succeeding time period will be happened with a high probability. For the device whose past operating status is different from the detected actual status, the probability at which the status shifts to the past operating status corresponding to the succeeding time period is assumed to be low. The weight value concerning the past operating status will also be considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the optimum value for the power saving control is set based on the determination. In this case, in a predicted operating status where the operations of all the devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N are stopped, the information processing apparatus is expected to shift to the sleep state or the power off state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> determines whether the predicted operating status is the sleep state or the power off state (step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). When the predicted operating status is the sleep state or the power off state (YES in the step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>), the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> inquires of the user as to whether the apparatus may shift to the sleep state or power off state by a screen display, and the like (step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>). If the apparatus directly shifts to the sleep state or power off state, this supposedly sometimes goes against a user&apos;s intention. By a response from the user, the system determines whether or not the apparatus can shift to the sleep state or the power off state (step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>). Of course, the power off state may be excluded beforehand from the predicted operating status. When there is no response from the user concerning the inquiry, the apparatus may automatically shift to the sleep state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> If the user does no permit a shift to the sleep state or power off state (NO in step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>), a predetermined standard operating status is set to the operating status for the succeeding time period (step S<highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> When the characteristic information is not found (NO in step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> detects the present operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N (step S<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>). Then, a predetermined standard operating status is set to the operating status for the succeeding time period (step S<highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> After steps S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and S<highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> updates the database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> by rewriting the characteristic information indicating the operating status corresponding to the present time period and the succeeding time period (step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, during the succeeding time period, the power management control is executed based on the set value (step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The end of the processing is not shown in the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. However, if the future operating status is the power off state or the sleep state, the processing is completed by the shift to the power off state or the sleep state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the first embodiment, the information processing apparatus having a plurality of devices generates the characteristic information indicating the tendencies of the operating status of the plurality of devices by the month, day of the week, and time period based on the history of the operating status concerning each of the devices; obtains the tendency of the operating status of each device corresponding to the present month, day of the week, and time period from the characteristic information; predicts the operating status of each device of the succeeding time period; and controls the on/off of the power supply of each device or the operating speed of the device based on the predicted operating status of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> According to the information processing apparatus, when the daily operating status by the user is learned, the optimum power management control suitable for the operating status can be realized. Particularly, when the tendency of the operating status is grasped for the month, day of the week, and time period, and the suitable power management control is performed, the setting of the power management can constantly be optimized. Furthermore, since the on/off of the power supply or the operating speed of the device is controlled individually for the devices, it is possible to eliminate any useless power consumption by the actually unused device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The characteristic information for at least each time period may be registered, and it is unnecessary to register the characteristic information for each month or each day of the week beforehand. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Second Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the constitution example of the information processing apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. The information processing apparatus has a constitution different from the constitution of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in that a power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>B constituted of hardware is provided in addition to a power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>A constituted of software, and the other respects are similar to those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>A constituted of software corresponds to the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>B constituted of hardware has an interface with the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>A, is managed/controlled by the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>A, and manages/controls the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>B comprises a controller for generating a wakeup signal to change the information processing apparatus to a power on state from the sleep state or the power off state at a set alarm time. The power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>A sets the alarm time to generate the wakeup signal in the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>B. That is, the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>A predicts a time to turn on the power supply of the information processing apparatus based on the above-described characteristic information, and sets the predicted time as the alarm time in the power management/control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>B. Even when the power supply of the information processing apparatus is turned off, the power continues to be supplied to the power management/ control system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>B from the battery, and the like, and the wakeup signal is automatically generated at the alarm time. This brings the information processing apparatus in the power on state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the flow of the processing operation by the power management/control systems <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the flow as seen from the user, and therefore the power off status is included. In the constitution of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the status of the power off, which is visible from the user, is also one of the managed statuses. Therefore, the flow of the processing operation does not have a starting point or an endpoint in the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The other processing operations are equal to those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Even in this embodiment, since the flow of the processing to be executed differs with the previous system status, it is first determined whether the previous system status was the sleep state, or the power off (shutdown) state, or was maintained in the power on state (step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>). The resume processing is executed, when the status was the sleep state (step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). The boot up processing is executed, when the status was the power off (shutdown) state (step S<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is searched to find characteristic information corresponding to the present time period and a succeeding time period (steps S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When the characteristic information is found (YES in step S<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>), the present operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N is detected (step S<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>). The operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N for the succeeding time period is predicted based on the detected present operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N and the characteristic information in the database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> indicating the past operating status corresponding to the present time period and the succeeding time period, and the set value for the optimum power saving control for each of the devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N is determined (steps S<highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the optimum value for the power saving control is set based on the determination. In this case, in a predicted operating status where the operations of all the devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N are stopped, the information processing apparatus is expected to shift to the sleep state or the power off state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, it is determined whether the predicted operating status is the sleep state or the power off state (step S<highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>). When the predicted operating status is the sleep state or the power off state (YES in the step S<highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>), the user is inquired as to whether the apparatus may shift to the sleep state or power off state by a screen display, and the like (step S<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>). By a response from the user, it is determined whether or not the apparatus can shift to the sleep state or the power off state (step S<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>). Of course, the power off state may be excluded beforehand from the predicted operating status. When there is no response from the user concerning the inquiry, the apparatus may automatically shift to the sleep state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If the user does no permit a shift to the sleep state or power off state (NO in step S<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>), a predetermined standard operating status is set to the operating status for the succeeding time period (step S<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When the characteristic information is not found (NO in step S<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>), the present operating status of the respective devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N is detected (step S<highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>). Then, a predetermined standard operating status is set to the operating status for the succeeding time period (step S<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> After steps S<highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, and S<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, the database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is updated by rewriting the characteristic information indicating the operating status corresponding to the present time period and the succeeding time period (step S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, during the succeeding time period, the power management control is executed based on the set value (step S<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As described above, even according to the second embodiment, when the daily operating status by the user is learned, the optimum power management control suitable for the operating status can be realized. Particularly, when the tendency of the past operating status is grasped by the day of the week, and the time period, and the suitable power management control is performed, the setting of the power management can constantly be optimized. Furthermore, since the on/off of the power supply or the operating speed of the device is controlled individually for the devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-N, it is possible to eliminate any useless power consumption by the actually unused device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The characteristic information may be registered for at least each time period, and it is unnecessary to register the characteristic information beforehand for each month, or each day of the week. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, it is possible to realize the optimum power management control suitable for the operating status of the information processing apparatus by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> While the description above refers to particular embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood that many modifications may be made without departing from the spirit thereof. The accompanying claims are intended to cover such modifications as would fall within the true scope and spirit of the present invention. The presently disclosed embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description, and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. For example, all the power management controls of the embodiments can be realized by software except for the generation of the wakeup signal. Therefore, when the computer program for allowing the computer to execute the procedure of the power management control is stored in a computer readable storage medium, and when this program is simply introduced and executed in the usual computer through the storage medium, an effect can easily be obtained similarly as the embodiments. </paragraph>
