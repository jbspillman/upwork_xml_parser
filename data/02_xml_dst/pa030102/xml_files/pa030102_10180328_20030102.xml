<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-195673, filed Jun. 28, 2001, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having a plurality of gate insulating films different in the film material or film thickness and a method of fabricating the same and, more particularly, to a semiconductor device in which gate insulating films are separately formed and a method of fabricating the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As an electrically erasable and programmable nonvolatile semiconductor memory (EEPROM), a MONOS EEPROM which stores electric charge into a silicon nitride film is known. MONOS represents Metal-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Semiconductor, and typically represents metal-silicon oxide film-silicon nitride film-silicon oxide film-semiconductor. In this MONOS EEPROM, a gate insulating film of a memory cell is an ONO stacked film, whereas a transistor forming a peripheral circuit has a MOS structure in which a silicon oxide film is a gate insulating film. Therefore, these two components must be separately formed in the fabrication of a MONOS EEPROM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a method of separately forming transistors having different gate insulating films, it is important to satisfy three points: the reliability of the gate insulating films, high performance of a memory cell, and a sufficient process margin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A method described in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 8-330436 is a method of separately forming transistors having different gate insulating films. In this prior art, after a device isolation region is formed by LOCOS, two gate oxide films different in film thickness and gate electrodes are formed. Recently, trench device isolation is beginning to be used instead of LOCOS. Compared to LOCOS, trench device isolation can realize a high device isolation breakdown voltage with a very small device isolation width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A method of separately forming a MONOS memory cell and a MOS peripheral transistor by using trench device isolation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>E will be described below. In this method, gate insulating films and gate electrodes are formed after the formation of device isolation regions, as in the technique described in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 8-330436 as the prior art described above. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>E, MC indicates a memory cell region, and PTR indicates a peripheral transistor region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference>A, device isolation regions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are formed in a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60B, a</cross-reference> sacrificial oxide film is removed by wet etching, and a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a gate electrode <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> of a peripheral circuit transistor are formed. In addition, a peripheral circuit region is covered with a resist layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference>C, the gate electrode and the gate oxide film in a memory cell region are removed. After an ONO film <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> as a gate insulating film of a memory cell is deposited on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a memory cell gate electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is deposited. Subsequently, the memory cell region is covered with a resist layer <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and the memory cell gate electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the ONO film <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> in the peripheral circuit region are removed. Finally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference>D, the resist layer <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is removed. As a consequence, the peripheral MOS transistor and the MONOS memory cell can be separately formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, this method has the following problems. The first problem is related to the nonuniformity of the ONO film. That is, since the edges of the device isolation regions are not flat but have steps, it is difficult to deposit the ONO film with a uniform film thickness and uniform film quality. This causes variations in the program characteristic and data holding characteristic of the memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The second problem is related to a parasitic transistor as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60E</cross-reference> which is an enlarged view of a region TP in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60D</cross-reference>. During wet etching before the formation of the gate insulating film, a buried oxide film in a device isolation trench is partially etched on the edge of the device isolation region. The gate electrode enters this etched portion to form a parasitic transistor. This causes characteristic variations in both the memory cell and the peripheral transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In this prior art, the peripheral transistor is formed first and then the memory cell transistor is formed. However, the above problems are not solved even if the formation order is changed; the problems arise because the gate insulating films are separately formed after the formation of the device isolation regions. A prior art to be explained below solves the above problems by separately forming gate insulating films before device isolation regions are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As a method of solving the above problems, &ldquo;1998 Symposium on VLSI Technology Digest of Technical Papers, pp. 102-103, &ldquo;A Self-Aligned STI Process Integration for Low Cost and Highly Reliable 1 Gbit Flash Memories&rdquo;, Y. Takeuchi et al.&rdquo; describes a self-aligned trench device isolation method which forms trench device isolation regions after gate insulating films and gate electrodes are formed. The steps of this fabrication method of separately forming a MONOS cell and a MOS peripheral transistor will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 61A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>A, impurity implantation for wells and channels is performed to form a memory cell well <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and a peripheral circuit well <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Next, an ONO film <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are separately formed. A polysilicon gate electrode <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> as a mask are deposited. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>B, device isolation trenches <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> are formed in a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is deposited on the exposed surface to fill the device isolation trenches <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>C, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is removed by CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) until the surface of the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> as a mask is exposed, thereby planarizing the surface. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>D, the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> as a mask is removed, and a tungsten silicide layer <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is deposited. A memory cell isolation region <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, a boundary area device isolation region <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, and a peripheral circuit device isolation region <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> are formed, and the individual gate electrodes are processed.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the course of developing the present invention, the present inventors studied the problems of the semiconductor device and its fabrication method as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 61A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>D. As a consequence, the present inventors obtained the following findings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>D, the trench device isolation depth of the boundary area device isolation region <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> between the MONOS transistor and the MOS transistor is the same as the trench depth of the MONOS region device isolation region <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and that of the MOS region device isolation region <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the trench width of the boundary area device isolation region <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is larger than that of the device isolation regions <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> in the other transistor regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the trench device isolation regions, after the trenches are filled with an oxide film as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>B, the buried oxide film is planarized by CMP as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61C</cross-reference>. However, a large trench width in the boundary area poses problems as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 62A and 62B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The first problem is the filling properties of the trench. This trench in the boundary area has a large width. If the buried oxide film is thin, therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference>A, an insufficiently filled region Q is formed in the center of the trench in the boundary area. When wet etching is used in the subsequent step, this insufficiently filled region is largely etched to cause poor filling properties. To solve this problem, a thick buried oxide film must be deposited. However, this increases not only the deposition amount of the oxide film but also the polish amount in the CMP step. Consequently, the process cost increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The second problem is the uniformity of CMP. One characteristic feature of CMP is dishing by which a wide space is polished. This dishing easily occurs because the trench in the boundary area is wide. If this is the case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference>B, the influence of dishing reaches the transistor regions to deform the gate electrode shapes, thereby lowering the process margin and yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Both the above problems arise because the trench in the boundary area is wide although its depth is the same as in the transistor regions. If the width of this trench in the boundary area is decreased to solve the above problems, the device isolation breakdown voltage lowers. Since in this case the breakdown voltage between the wells becomes insufficient, it is difficult to solve the problems by this method. Accordingly, a semiconductor device having two or more different gate insulating films requires a highly reliable device structure and fabrication method by which both a sufficient process margin and satisfactory device performance are achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention constituted on the basis of the above findings will be explained below with reference to the accompanying drawing. In the following explanation, the same reference numerals denote parts having substantially the same functions and arrangements, and a repetitive explanation thereof will be made only where necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing a boundary area and its vicinity of a semiconductor device according to the first embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B, 2A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are sectional views showing boundary areas and their vicinities of semiconductor devices according to modifications of the first embodiment. The characteristic feature of this embodiment is that two types of transistors (e.g., first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) different in the type of the gate insulating films such as a film material and a film thickness are present on the same semiconductor substrate, and that a boundary area BS between these transistors has a device isolation region shape or electrode structure different from those of these transistors (i.e., the device isolation region shapes or electrode structures in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). More specifically, the boundary area BS is provided with a trench-type device isolation region having depths different with portions, or an electrode structure having thicknesses different with portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> has the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the boundary area BS formed between these first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in contact with them. When the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a high-voltage transistor region, a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a silicon oxide film about 10 to 40 nm thick. When the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a low-voltage transistor region, a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a silicon oxide film about 1 to 10 nm thick. When the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a memory cell region, this gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a silicon oxide film about 1 to 10 nm thick or an ONO film about 10 to 50 nm thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, at least two of the three transistor regions described above are formed adjacent to each other such that the types or film thicknesses of their gate insulating films are different. Note that a well having a conductivity type opposite to that of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be formed near the surface of this semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, another well having the same conductivity type as the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be formed on the well having the opposite conductivity type (this similarly applies to the rest of the specification). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed on the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed on this lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a first gate electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a pair of source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are formed by implantation using the first gate electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as a mask. This first gate electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> form a first transistor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Both the lower and upper electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are polysilicon layers or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A trench type device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed in the boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. On the bottom of the trench of this device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a step having a projection <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which projects upward is formed. This changes the depth of this trench from one portion to another. The width of the projection <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a direction in which the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected is about 100 to 10,000 nm, and desirably, about 100 to 1,000 nm. The height of the projection <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the deep portion of the bottom of the trench is about 10 to 300 nm, and desirably, about 30 to 100 nm. This height changes in accordance with the film thicknesses of the gate electrode materials in the adjacent first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Also, the width of the projection <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which projects upward on the bottom of the device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is determined by taking account of misalignment of lithography in the fabrication process. For example, this width is about 100 to 10,000 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> adjacent to the boundary area BS, a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed on the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on this lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a second gate electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a pair of source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed by implantation using the second gate electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a mask. This second gate electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> form a second transistor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Both the lower and upper electrode layers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are polysilicon layers or the like. Another device isolation region can also be formed between the device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and each of the left and right transistors <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the structures of first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, and the structure of a boundary area BS is different from that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. Around a device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed on a first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed on a second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In addition, an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed on the device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and on the lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> around this device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a gate structure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, the gate structure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is desirably electrically insulated from gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. Another device isolation region can also be formed between the device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and each of left and right transistors <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> are characterized in that the bottom of the trench in the device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the boundary area BS has a step, particularly, the projection <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which projects upward. Additionally, the depth of the trench in this device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the side of the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> differs from that on the side of the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In these structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the device isolation depth decreases in the center of the device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, good filling properties are obtained, and the fabrication yield improves. One reason is that in the step of filling the device isolation trench formed in the semiconductor substrate with an insulator, the filling aspect ratio decreases, and this improves the filling properties. Another reason is that in the step of filling the device isolation trench with an insulator, a degree to which a recess is formed in the upper surface in the center of the device isolation region decreases, and this prevents dishing when the upper surface of the insulator is planarized to a predetermined depth and removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the gate structure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> is easily processed, because this gate structure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is the same as the gate structures in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the structures of first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, and the structure of a boundary area BS is different from those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. In this boundary area BS, a first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed from the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the center, and a second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed from the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the center. Also, in the boundary area BS, an electrode layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> made of the same material as a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper surface of a portion of the first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and on the upper surface of a portion of the second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. On that side surface of this electrode layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which faces the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a side-wall insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of the same material as the second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed. The height of the electrode layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the boundary area BS is smaller than that of the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> If necessary for well isolation or the like, a device isolation region is formed between the boundary area BS and each of the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this shape, the gate electrode layers in the transistor regions are partially left behind in the boundary area BS. This improves the gate processing margins in the transistor regions. This gate processing margin improving effect is particularly notable when fine memory cell transistors are to be formed in these transistor regions. This shape is also readily processed since no device isolation region having a special shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the semiconductor substrate is not etched in the boundary area BS, and the electrode layer in the boundary area BS is not removed. Therefore, the film thickness of the electrode layer to be etched is the same as the gate electrode film thickness of the transistor. This eliminates a lowering of the yield caused by processing of the boundary area BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the structures of first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, and the structure of a boundary area BS is different from those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. As in the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, in this boundary area BS, a first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed from the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the center, and a second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed from the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the center. Also, in the boundary area BS, a first electrode layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> made of the same material as a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed on the first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Additionally, in the boundary area BS, a horizontal portion of a second electrode layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed on the second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to be adjacent to the first electrode layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via an insulating film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This second electrode layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is made of the same material and has the same film thickness as a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The film thickness of the insulating film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is the same as the second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the boundary area BS, the second electrode layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has a vertical portion stacked on its horizontal portion, and has a stacked portion extending from this vertical portion toward the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, the second electrode layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is stacked on a portion of the first electrode layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via the insulating film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a stacked electrode layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is formed on the first and second electrode layers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. A gate structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed by the first electrode layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the second electrode layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the insulating film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the stacked electrode layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In the boundary area BS, therefore, the gate structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed to be higher than the transistors formed in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> This semiconductor memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is characterized in that the gate structure has a stacked structure in the boundary area BS as described above. In this portion, the first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the first electrode layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having the same film thickness and composition as the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are stacked on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. On top of this stacked structure, the second electrode layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> having the same film thickness and composition as the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is stacked via the insulating film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having the same film thickness and composition as the second gate insulating film. Also, both the first and second gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are present below the first and second electrode layers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> electrically connected to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In this structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the width of the gate structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is, e.g., about 100 to 10,000 nm, and desirably, about 500 to 1,000 nm. In the boundary area BS, the height of the highest portion of the gate structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is the sum of the height of a second transistor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the height of the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the height of the first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> If necessary for well isolation or the like, a device isolation region is formed between the boundary area BS and each of the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> By the use of this structure, a plurality of transistors can be formed on the same semiconductor substrate with a few fabrication steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In addition, the semiconductor substrate is not etched in the boundary area BS, and the stacked gate in the boundary area BS is not processed. Therefore, the film thickness of the electrode layer to be etched is the same as the gate electrode film thickness of the transistor. This eliminates a lowering of the yield caused by processing of the boundary area BS. In particular, the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> improves the yield since the gate electrode having the stacked structure in the boundary area BS need not be etched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> are sectional views showing, in the gate electrode extending direction, first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively, according to this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, in the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> a plurality of device isolation regions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are formed in a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed between the device isolation regions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. An upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed on the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. On this upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an interlayer dielectric film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, in the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> a plurality of device isolation regions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are formed in a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed between the device isolation regions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. An upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. On this upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an interlayer dielectric film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, the device isolation regions are formed to be self-aligned with the gate electrodes. Therefore, on the edge of each device isolation region, the gate electrode does not fall to the side surface of the gate insulating film, unlike in the prior art explained previously. This prevents the formation of a parasitic transistor on the edges of the device isolation regions, and improves the performance of the transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Also, this embodiment uses a process (to be referred to as a self-aligned STI process hereinafter) which forms gate insulating films before the formation of device isolation trenches, and forms device isolation trenches to be self-aligned with the gate electrodes and gate insulating films. This reduces the number of fabrication steps because the process has no steps of depositing and removing dummy insulating films and dummy gates for forming device isolation regions. Also, the fabrication process of this embodiment has no step of directly coating the gate insulating films with a photoresist. This can improve the reliability of these gate insulating films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Examples of a semiconductor device fabrication method according to this embodiment will be described below. First, a method of fabricating the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> sacrificial oxide film (not shown) is formed on the upper surface of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Next, a well impurity and a channel impurity are implanted as needed, and the sacrificial oxide film is removed. Subsequently, a first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> made of, e.g., polysilicon are formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B, a</cross-reference> first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a region from this first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the center of a boundary area BS are covered with a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the gate electrode layer and the gate insulating film in other regions are removed. The method of removal can be either isotropic etching such as wet etching or anisotropic etching such as RIE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, after the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is removed, a second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> made of, e.g., polysilicon are formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Consequently, a stacked structure in which the second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed on the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is obtained in the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The material and film thickness of the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be different from those of the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, if the materials and film thicknesses of these layers are the same, gate electrodes are readily etched at the same time in the subsequent step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a region from this second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the center of the boundary area BS are covered with a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and the gate electrode layer and the gate insulating film in other regions are removed. The method of removal can be either isotropic etching such as wet etching or anisotropic etching such as RIE. Etching is so performed that a portion of the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> overlaps the edge of the remaining lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The edges of the photoresist layers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> overlap or do not overlap depending on misalignment. In this embodiment, however, assume that the edges of these layers overlap. That is, the gate electrode stacked structure remains in the boundary area BS of separate formation between the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is removed, and first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are deposited. The first mask layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon nitride film, and the second mask layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon oxide film. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for forming a device isolation region is deposited on the second mask layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and a device isolation pattern is formed. This photoresist layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is positioned above portions where no device isolation region is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, the first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are removed by anisotropic etching to expose those portions of the lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which correspond to a device isolation region in the boundary area BS. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> exposed from the second mask layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are removed by anisotropic etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In that portion of the boundary area BS of separate formation, which corresponds to a device isolation region, the two lower electrode layers are stacked before etching. Therefore, only the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is etched. The lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> remains as an electrode layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, in the boundary area BS the second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> remains as a side-wall insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In addition, from this side-wall insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> toward the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> remains as a residual film <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such that the film thickness reduces in the direction away from the boundary area BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>C, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is etched to form a device isolation region. The depth of a trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> formed as a device isolation region in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is about 50 to 300 nm, and desirably, about 150 to 250 nm. In the boundary area BS of separate formation, a step made up of the electrode layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the residual film <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> forms a projection <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the bottom of the trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The step amount of this projection <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> depends upon the film thickness of the electrode layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> remaining in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B and the etching conditions. For example, this step amount is about 10 to 300 nm, and desirably, about 30 to 100 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Also, the depth of the bottom of the trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the side of the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> differs from that on the side of the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This depth reflects the difference between the film thicknesses of the first and second gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>; the thinner the gate insulating film, the deeper the trench. In this embodiment, the depth of the bottom of the trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the side of the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is smaller than that on the side of the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by about 5 to 50 nm, and desirably, about 10 to 30 nm. This is so because the thickness of the first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is larger than that of the second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by about 5 to 50 nm, and desirably, about 10 to 30 nm. At this time, trenches for the device isolation regions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>) are formed together in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, by etching the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be self-aligned with the first and second lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, an insulator <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film is buried in the trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the boundary area BS and the trenches in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and deposited on the second mask layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In the boundary area BS, the filling properties are good because the device isolation depth is small. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the first mask layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used as a stopper to etch back the insulator <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> by a method such as CMP. After this etch back, the upper portion of the insulator <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is almost flat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, the first mask layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is removed, and an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is deposited on the entire exposed surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is a polysilicon film, a multilayered film of polysilicon and a metal or a silicon and metal compound, or a single-layered film of a metal or a silicon and metal compound. Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> photoresist <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for processing the gate electrode layers is deposited and patterned so as not to remain in the boundary area BS. Therefore, the gate electrode layers in this boundary area BS are removed in the later step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to anisotropically etch the gate electrode layers, thereby forming first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. After that, damage by the processing is recovered by post-oxidation or the like. The first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are then used as masks to implant a diffusion layer impurity into the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby forming source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Note that it is also possible to deposit a mask layer such as a silicon nitride film or silicon oxide film on the gate electrode layers and process the gate electrode layers by using this mask layer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A method of fabricating the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> will be described below.

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for processing gate electrode layers and a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for forming electrode layers on a device isolation region are deposited and patterned. The photoresist layer <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is so formed as to have a width larger than the width of an insulator <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the horizontal direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, i</cross-reference>.e., to have a width enough to allow gate electrode layers to remain on the side surfaces of the insulator <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> after etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, these photoresist layers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are used as masks to anisotropically etch the gate electrode layers, thereby forming first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a gate structure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and a device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. After that, damage by the processing is recovered by post-oxidation or the like. The first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are then used as masks to implant a diffusion layer impurity into the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby forming source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Note that it is also possible to deposit a mask layer such as a silicon nitride film or silicon oxide film on the gate electrode layers and process the gate electrode layers by using this mask layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> After that, although not shown, interlayer dielectric films, contact plugs, interconnections, and the like are formed to complete the semiconductor device. When the boundary area BS has a device isolation region as described above, a step remains on the bottom of this device isolation region as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> A method of fabricating the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> will be described below. Until the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, this fabrication method is the same as the fabrication method of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for device isolation is deposited on a second mask layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the photoresist is left behind in a boundary area BS of separate formation, so no device isolation region is formed in that portion. After the second mask layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is anisotropically etched, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is removed to expose the second mask layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. At this time, although not shown, there are etched portions in the second mask layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Next, using the steps of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B, the device isolation regions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>) are formed in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The shape of the boundary area BS at this time is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference>. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, the first mask layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is removed, an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is formed on exposed lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Since the boundary area BS is covered with the resist as described above, the stacked structure of the gate electrode layers remains as it is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for processing gate electrode layers is deposited and patterned. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, this photoresist layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to anisotropically etch the gate electrode layers, thereby forming first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. After that, damage by the processing is recovered by post-oxidation or the like. The first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are then used as masks to implant a diffusion layer impurity into a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby forming source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a diffusion layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the boundary area BS. Note that it is also possible to deposit a mask layer such as a silicon nitride film or silicon oxide film on the gate electrode layers and process the gate electrode layers by using this mask layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> After that, although not shown, interlayer dielectric films, contact plugs, interconnections, and the like are formed to complete the semiconductor device. When no device isolation region is formed in the boundary area BS and the gate electrode layers are removed from that portion as described above, the result is a shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> If, however, an etching residue is produced because the gate electrode layers have a stacked structure in the boundary area BS, the result is the shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. That is, the first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, an electrode layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a side-wall insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are used as masks to implant an diffusion layer impurity into the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby forming source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Even in this case, there is no problem such as a gate electrode short circuit. In addition, the etching time can be made shorter than that when the gate electrodes in the boundary area BS are completely removed. Furthermore, since the etching conditions need be optimized in accordance only with the transistor regions, the total processing margin improves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> A method of fabricating the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> will be described below. Until the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, this fabrication method is the same as the fabrication method of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for processing gate electrode layers and a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> for forming a gate structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a boundary area BS are deposited and patterned. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, these photoresist layers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are used as masks to anisotropically etch the gate electrode layers, thereby forming first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the gate structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. After that, damage by the processing is recovered by post-oxidation or the like. The first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the gate structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are then used as masks to implant a diffusion layer impurity into a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby forming source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Note that it is also possible to deposit a mask layer such as a silicon nitride film or silicon oxide film on the gate electrode layers and process the gate electrode layers by using this mask layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> After that, although not shown, interlayer dielectric films, contact plugs, interconnections, and the like are formed to complete the semiconductor device. In this shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> as described above, a gate structure in which electrode layers unprocessed by etching are stacked is formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the boundary area BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Generally, the boundary area BS of separate formation has a special shape, so the gate electrode is difficult to process. In this method, the gate electrode in the boundary area BS need not be etched, and this facilitates processing and improves the yield. The gate electrode is particularly difficult to process when it has a stacked structure in the boundary area BS as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. Therefore, the effect of obviating the necessity of processing this portion is large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment as described above, in a semiconductor device having two or more transistors different in gate insulating film thickness or type, these gate insulating films are separately formed prior to the formation of a device isolation trench, and the number of fabrication steps is reduced by improving the structure of the boundary area BS. Additionally, the performance of the semiconductor device can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in this embodiment, the shape of a device isolation trench or gate electrode and the process of separate formation are improved in the boundary area BS contacting transistor regions in a semiconductor device having two or more different gate insulating films. This improves the reliability and can achieve both a sufficient process margin and satisfactory device performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is particularly useful in a nonvolatile semiconductor device in which a device isolation region is formed to be self-aligned with a gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, gate insulating films are separately formed before a device isolation trench is formed. Also, these gate insulating films are not directly coated with a photoresist during the separate formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> This embodiment can provide a semiconductor device in which a device isolating oxide film is not etched from the edge of a device isolation region, and gate insulating films are highly reliable. Furthermore, when an ONO film is used as a gate insulating film of a memory cell, it is possible to prevent nonuniformity of the ONO film thickness on the edge of a device isolation region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In the structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the bottom of the device isolation trench in the boundary area BS projects upward. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, when this trench is filled, the upper surface reflects the shape of the trench bottom portion, so the surface of the buried oxide film projects upward in the center of the boundary area BS. Although a wide device isolation region is readily dished during CMP, the buried shape projecting upward cancels this dishing. Consequently, CMP can be performed flat as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. As described above, neither poor trench filling nor dishing by CMP occur unlike in the conventional device isolation regions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 62A and 62B</cross-reference>. This increases the process margin and improves the yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Even where the trench has the same depth on the right and left sides with a projection projecting upward, it is possible to obtain the effects described above, although the trench has depths different between the right and left sides in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. In addition, there is also an effect in that a leakage current flowing through the STI bottom is reduced. This is so because the STI bottom becomes longer due to the step formed by the projection, thereby making formation of a leakage passage difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the unprocessed gate electrode in the boundary area BS is made thicker than those in the transistor regions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>. If this gate electrode in the boundary area BS is to be completely removed, the etching amount in the boundary area BS becomes larger than that in the transistor regions. If the gate electrode in the boundary area BS is completely removed in this state, the etching amount in the transistor regions becomes too large, so the semiconductor substrate itself is etched. A processing margin for preventing this overetching is difficult to ensure. In this embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, however, the gate electrode in the boundary area BS is also etched by the same amount as the gate electrodes in the transistor regions. Since the etching amount can be determined only in the transistor regions, a sufficient processing margin can be assured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In the structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2B</cross-reference>, the boundary area BS is covered with a photoresist during gate processing, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>A, so the gate electrode in this boundary area BS is not etched. Particularly in the boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 10B</cross-reference>, since the gate electrode structure differs from that in the transistor regions, it is difficult to etch this gate electrode in the boundary area BS simultaneously with the gate electrodes in the transistor regions. In the structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2B</cross-reference>, the etching amount can be determined only in the transistor regions. Accordingly, a sufficient processing margin can be ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In the method as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> in which the gate electrode in the boundary area BS is partially left behind, the boundary area BS need not be covered with a resist when the gate electrode is etched. Hence, no alignment margin is necessary, and this can reduce a region for the gate electrode in the boundary area BS. On the other hand, in the method as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> in which the gate electrode in the boundary area BS is entirely left behind, the pattern of the gate electrode in this boundary area BS is large. This eliminates the possibility that this gate electrode peels off to produce dust, so the yield increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing a boundary area and its vicinity of a semiconductor device according to the second embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14B, 15A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B are sectional views showing boundary areas and their vicinities of semiconductor devices according to modifications of the second embodiment. The characteristic feature of this embodiment is that two types of transistors (e.g., first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) different in the type of the gate insulating films such as a film material and a film thickness are present on the same semiconductor substrate, and that a boundary area BS between these transistors has a device isolation region shape or electrode structure different from those of these transistors (i.e., the device isolation region shapes or electrode structures in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). More specifically, the boundary area BS, etc. is provided with a trench-type device isolation region having depths different with portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> has the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the boundary area BS formed between these first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in contact with them. When the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a high-voltage transistor region, a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a silicon oxide film about 10 to 40 nm thick. When the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a low-voltage transistor region, a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a silicon oxide film about 1 to 10 nm thick. When the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a memory cell region, this gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a silicon oxide film about 1 to 10 nm thick or ONO film about 10 to 50 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, at least two of the three transistor regions described above are formed adjacent to each other such that the types or film thicknesses of their gate insulating films are different. Note that a well having a conductivity type opposite to that of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be formed near the surface of this semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, another well having the same conductivity type as the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be formed on the well having the opposite conductivity type (this similarly applies to the rest of the specification). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed on the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed on this lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a first gate electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a pair of source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are formed by implantation using the first gate electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as a mask. This first gate electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> form a first transistor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Both the lower and upper electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are polysilicon layers or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> A trench type device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is formed in the boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>. On the bottom of the trench of this device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a step having a projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which projects downward is formed. This changes the depth of this trench from one portion to another. The width of the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in a direction in which the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected is about 100 to 10,000 nm, and desirably, about 100 to 1,000 nm. The height (depth) of the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> from the shallow portion of the bottom of the trench is about 10 to 300 nm, and desirably, about 30 to 100 nm. This height changes in accordance with the film thicknesses of the gate electrode materials in the adjacent first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Also, the width of the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which projects downward on the bottom of the device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is determined by taking account of misalignment of lithography in the fabrication process. For example, this width is about 100 to 10,000 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> adjacent to the boundary area BS, a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed on the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on this lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a second gate electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a pair of source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed by implantation using the second gate electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a mask. This second gate electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> form a second transistor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Both the lower and upper electrode layers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are polysilicon layers or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, the depth of the device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is larger in the center of the boundary area BS than in those portions of the boundary area BS which are close to the left and right transistor regions. This improves the device isolation breakdown voltage. The bottom of this device isolation region becomes shallower as the thickness of the gate insulating film in the adjacent transistor region increases, and becomes deeper as the thickness of the gate insulating film decreases. Also, the bottom of the trench in the device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a step, so the depth of the bottom of this device isolation region on the side of the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> differs from that on the side of the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by about 5 to <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> nm, and desirably, about 10 to 30 nm. This is so because the film thickness of the first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is larger than that of the second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by about 5 to 50 nm, and desirably, about 10 to 30 nm. Another device isolation region can also be formed between the device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and each of the left and right transistors <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>B, the structures of first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>A, and the structure of a boundary area BS is different from that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>. Around a device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed on a first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed on a second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In addition, an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed on the device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and on the lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> around this device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a gate structure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, the gate structure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is desirably electrically insulated from gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. Another device isolation region can also be formed between the device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and each of left and right transistors <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference> are characterized in that the bottom of the trench in the device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the boundary area BS has a step, particularly, the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which projects downward. Additionally, the depth of the trench in this device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the side of the first transistor region TRI differs from that on the side of the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The bottom of this device isolation region becomes shallower as the thickness of the gate insulating film in the adjacent transistor region increases, and becomes deeper as the thickness of the gate insulating film decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Since the device isolation depth increases in the center of the device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a high device isolation breakdown voltage can be obtained even when the device is highly integrated by decreasing the width of the device isolation region. That is, the trench width can be made smaller to make the device finer than in the conventional device in which the trench depth in the transistor regions and the boundary area BS is constant. In addition, there is also an effect in that a leakage current flowing through the STI bottom is reduced. This is so because the STI bottom becomes longer due to the step formed by the projection, thereby making formation of a leakage passage difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the gate structure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference> is easily processed, because this gate structure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is the same as the gate structures in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>A, the structures of first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>, and the structure of a boundary area BS is different from those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>. In this boundary area BS, a recess <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> formed in a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> If necessary for well isolation or the like, a device isolation region is formed between the boundary area BS and each of the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> This shape is readily processed since no device isolation region having a special shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference> is formed in the boundary area BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>B, the structures of first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>, and the structure of a boundary area BS is different from those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>. As in the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>A, no device isolation region is formed in the boundary area BS. In this boundary area BS, an electrode layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is directly formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This electrode layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has the same composition and the same height as upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Also, first and second conductive side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are formed on those side surfaces of the electrode layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, which oppose the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. The first conductive side wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has the same composition as a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and is formed between a projection of the electrode layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and a first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second conductive side wall <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> has the same composition as a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and is formed between a projection of the electrode layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and a second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. With this structure, the height of the gate structure in the boundary area BS equals the height of the transistors formed in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> If necessary for well isolation or the like, a device isolation region is formed between the boundary area BS and each of the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> As described above, the semiconductor memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference> is characterized in that the electrode layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is in direct contact with the semiconductor substrate in the boundary area BS. In addition, in this boundary area BS the first and second gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> exist on the two sides of the electrode layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. By the use of this structure, a plurality of transistors can be formed on the same semiconductor substrate with a few fabrication steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>B, the semiconductor substrate is not etched in the boundary area BS, and the electrode layer in this boundary area BS is not removed. Therefore, the film thickness of the conductor to be etched is the same as the gate electrode film thickness of the transistor. This eliminates a lowering of the yield caused by processing of the boundary area BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Also, the fabrication process of this embodiment has no step of directly coating the gate insulating films with a photoresist. This can improve the reliability of these gate insulating films. Especially in the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>B, the gate electrode is left behind in the boundary area BS by patterning. This improves the yield since the gate electrode having a special structure in the boundary area BS need not be etched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> As in the first embodiment, this embodiment also has the structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. Since the gate electrode does not fall to the side surface of the gate insulating film on the edge of each device isolation region, it is possible to prevent the formation of a parasitic transistor on the edges of the device isolation regions, and improve the performance of the transistors. Also, the number of fabrication steps is reduced because a self-aligned STI process is used, and the process has no steps of depositing and removing dummy insulating films and dummy gates for forming device isolation regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Examples of a semiconductor device fabrication method according to this embodiment will be described below. First, a method of fabricating the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A, a</cross-reference> sacrificial oxide film (not shown) is formed on the upper surface of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Next, a well impurity and a channel impurity are implanted as needed, and the sacrificial oxide film is removed. Subsequently, a first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> made of, e.g., polysilicon are formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B, a</cross-reference> first transistor region TRI and a region extending halfway in a boundary area BS from this first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are covered with a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and the gate electrode layer and the gate insulating film in other regions are removed. The method of removal can be either isotropic etching such as wet etching or anisotropic etching such as RIE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C, a</cross-reference> second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> made of, e.g., polysilicon are formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Consequently, a stacked structure in which the second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed on the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is obtained in the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The material and film thickness of the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be different from those of the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, if the materials and film thicknesses of these layers are the same, gate electrodes are readily etched at the same time in the subsequent step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>A, the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a region extending halfway in a boundary area BS from this second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are covered with a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and the gate electrode layer and the gate insulating film in other regions are removed. The method of removal can be either isotropic etching such as wet etching or anisotropic etching such as RIE. Etching is so performed that the edge of the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is separated from the edge of the remaining lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. That is, in the center of the boundary area BS of separate formation of the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, both the lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are removed, and the surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>B, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is removed, and first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are deposited. The first mask layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon nitride film, and the second mask layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon oxide film. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for forming a device isolation region is deposited on the second mask layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and a device isolation pattern is formed. This photoresist layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is positioned above portions where no device isolation region is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>A, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used to remove the first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> by anisotropic etching, so that a hole corresponding to the device isolation pattern is formed. Since no gate electrode is present in the center of the boundary area BS of separate formation, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is exposed to the surface in that portion after the etching. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>B, the lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> not covered with the first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are removed by anisotropic etching. Consequently, in the center of the boundary area BS the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is etched to form a recess <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>C, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is etched to form a device isolation region. The depth of a trench <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> formed as a device isolation region in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is about 50 to 300 nm, and desirably, about 150 to 250 nm. In the boundary area BS of separate formation, the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference> forms a downward projection on the bottom of the trench <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The step amount of this projection depends upon the film thickness of the lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the etching conditions. Generally, this step amount is about 10 to 300 nm, and desirably, about 30 to 100 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Also, the depth of the bottom of the trench <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> on the side of the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> differs from that on the side of the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the depth of the bottom of the trench <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> on the side of the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is smaller than that on the side of the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by about 5 to 50 nm, and desirably, about 10 to 30 nm. This is so because the thickness of the first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is larger than that of the second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. At this time, trenches for the device isolation regions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>) are formed together in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, by etching the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be self-aligned with the first and second lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>A, an insulator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film is buried in the trench <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in the boundary area BS and the trenches in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and etched back by a method such as CMP by using the first mask layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> as a stopper. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>B, the first mask layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is removed, and an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is deposited on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is a polysilicon film, a multilayered film of polysilicon and a metal or a silicon and metal compound, or a single-layered film of a metal or a silicon and metal compound. Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> for processing the gate electrodes is deposited, and gate electrode patterns are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to anisotropically etch the gate electrodes, thereby forming first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. After that, damage by the processing is recovered by post-oxidation or the like. A diffusion layer impurity is then implanted to form source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such that no resist layer is left behind in the boundary area BS and the gate electrodes are removed from this boundary area BS. Note that it is also possible to deposit a mask layer such as a silicon nitride film or silicon oxide film on the gate electrode layers and process the gate electrode layers by using this mask layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> After that, although not shown, interlayer dielectric films, contact plugs, interconnections, and the like are formed to complete the semiconductor device. When the device isolation region is formed in the boundary area BS as described above, a step remains as the downward projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> on the bottom of the device isolation trench. Note that the device isolation trench is deep in the boundary area BS, so the buried shape sometimes projects downward by reflecting that. In this case, a recess <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is formed in the upper surface as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> A method of fabricating the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference> will be described below. Until the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>B, this fabrication method is the same as the fabrication method of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>. In the above fabrication process, the photoresist layer for processing the gate electrodes is opened in the boundary area BS. In this fabrication method, a photoresist layer is left behind in a boundary area BS. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21, a</cross-reference> pattern by which a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is left behind in the boundary area BS of separate formation is used. In this case, holes are formed in a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> outside the width of a trench <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>B, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to anisotropically etch the gate electrodes, thereby forming first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Around a device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> remains on a first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> remains on a second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. An upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is left behind in the device isolation region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and on the lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> around the region <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a gate structure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. After that, damage by the processing is recovered by post-oxidation or the like. A diffusion layer impurity is then implanted into a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in a first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and source/drain layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Note that it is also possible to deposit a mask layer such as a silicon nitride film or silicon oxide film on the gate electrode layers and process the gate electrode layers by using this mask layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Note also that the device isolation trench is deep in the boundary area BS, so the buried shape sometimes projects downward by reflecting that. In this case, a recess <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is formed in the upper surface as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, and an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed by filling this recess <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> A method of fabricating the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> will be described below. Until the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>B, this fabrication method is the same as the fabrication method of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> for device isolation is deposited on a second mask layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. After the second mask layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is anisotropically etched, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>B, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is removed to expose the upper surface of the second mask layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. At this time, although not shown, there are etched portions in the second mask layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Next, using the steps of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A, the device isolation regions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>) are formed in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The shape of the boundary area BS at this time is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</cross-reference>. The second mask layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> remains in a recess <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> formed on the upper surface of the first mask layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>B, the first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are removed to expose the upper surfaces of lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby forming an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) on these upper surfaces. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> for forming gate electrodes is formed on this upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>B, etching is performed using this photoresist layer <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> as a mask, thereby forming first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. After that, damage by the processing is recovered by post-oxidation or the like. A diffusion layer impurity is then implanted into the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in a first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this step, a boundary area BS is not covered with any mask, so a diffusion layer similar to the source/drain diffusion layers in the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also formed in this boundary area BS. The boundary area BS can be covered with a photoresist layer, so that no source/drain diffusion layers are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> When the boundary area BS is not a device isolation region and the gate electrodes are removed from this boundary area BS as described above, the result is a shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</cross-reference>. However, high etching selectivity is difficult to ensure in the boundary area BS because the gate electrode is in direct contact with the semiconductor substrate in that portion. If the semiconductor substrate is etched, the result is the shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference>. Even in this case, no gate electrode remains, so there is no problem such as a gate electrode short circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> A method of fabricating the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference> will be described below. Until the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>B, this fabrication method is the same as the fabrication method of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for forming gate electrodes in first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a gate structure in a boundary area BS is formed on an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). Around the boundary area BS, this photoresist layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is so formed as to extend to the outside of a recess <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>B, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to etch the gate electrode layers, thereby forming first and second gate electrodes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, an electrode layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and first and second conductive side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. In this structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>B, the electrode layer in direct contact with a semiconductor substrate in the boundary area BS remains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The boundary area BS of separate formation has a special shape, so the gate electrode is difficult to process. In this method, the gate electrode in the boundary area BS need not be processed, and this facilitates processing and improves the yield compared to other methods. The gate electrode is particularly difficult to process when it is in direct contact with the semiconductor substrate in the boundary area BS. Therefore, the effect of obviating the necessity of processing this portion is large. </paragraph>

In this embodiment, therefore, the trench bottom portion projects downward, and the trench width is made smaller than in the conventional devices. This prevents poor filling and dishing without lowering the device isolation breakdown voltage. In this case, the trench aspect ratio (height-to-width ratio) in the boundary area BS increases. However, by making this trench aspect ratio lower than that in the memory cell region, a significant lowering of the filling characteristics caused by the increase in the aspect ratio can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> In the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> in which no gate electrode is left behind and the semiconductor substrate is etched in the boundary area BS, no dust is produced because no gate electrode remains in the boundary area BS. Also, since the boundary area BS is not covered with any resist, the sarface area of this boundary area BS can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In the fabrication method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>A, the unprocessed gate electrode is not thicker than the transistor regions. Accordingly, the etching amount can be determined by the necessary amount in the transistor regions. In addition, the semiconductor substrate is etched only in the boundary area BS, so etching damage is of no problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference> in which the electrode layers <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (the conductive portions of the gate structure) are left behind in the boundary area BS, and these electrode layers are electrically connected to the semiconductor substrate (well), the gate electrodes can be processed in accordance only with the conditions in the transistor regions. In particular, electrically connecting the electrode layers (the conductive portions of the gate structure) to the well lowers the well resistance and increases the speeds of rise and fall of the voltage of the well. This improves the device performance. Furthermore, since a potential can be given to the well or the semiconductor substrate through the electrode layers, it is unnecessary to form another well contact or substrate contact. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>A, the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have the same structures as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. In addition, a device isolation region <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> having on its bottom a projection <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> which projects upward is formed between the second and third transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the third region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a third gate insulating film <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This third gate insulating film <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> has the composition and film thickness different from those of first and second gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. On this third gate insulating film <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, a third gate electrode <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in which a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are stacked is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> This third gate electrode <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to form source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a third transistor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</cross-reference> is characterized in that the bottom of a trench in a device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in one boundary area BS has a step, particularly, a projection <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which projects upward. Likewise, the bottom of a trench in the device isolation region <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the other boundary area BS has a step, particularly, the projection <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> which projects upward. Additionally, the depth of the trench in the device isolation region <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the side of the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> differs from that on the side of the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Analogously, the depth of the trench in the device isolation region <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> on the side of the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> differs from that on the side of the third transistor region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this structure, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is thinner than the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in the third transistor region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so the bottom of the device isolation region <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is shallower on the side of the third transistor region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</cross-reference> is characterized in that the structure of a boundary area BS between first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> differs from the structure of a boundary area BS between the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a third transistor region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the boundary area BS between the second and third transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the bottom of a device isolation region <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has no projection, i.e., has only a step resulting from the difference between the depths of regions contacting this device isolation region <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Since the film thickness of a third gate insulating film <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is made larger than that of a second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the device isolation region <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is deeper on the side of the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In the third transistor region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the third gate insulating film <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a third gate electrode <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> made up of a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and an upper electrode layer <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is formed on this third gate insulating film <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. This third gate electrode <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to form source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a third transistor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The use of these structures realizes a self-aligned STI process requiring no steps of depositing and removing dummy insulating films and dummy gates for STI formation. Consequently, a plurality of transistors can be formed on the same semiconductor substrate with a few fabrication steps. Also, the fabrication process of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</cross-reference> has no step of directly coating the gate insulating films with a photoresist. This can improve the reliability of these gate insulating films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In the fabrication process of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B, a</cross-reference> step of removing the separately formed gate electrodes is omitted.

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C, in the transistor of this embodiment the gate electrode is formed to be self-aligned with the device isolation region. Therefore, on the edge of each device isolation region, the gate electrode does not fall to the side surface of the gate insulating film. This prevents the formation of a parasitic transistor on the edges of the device isolation regions, and improves the performance of the transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The structure of the boundary area BS of separate formation shown in each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</cross-reference> is formed by the method which overlaps gate electrodes and forms a device isolation trench in the boundary area BS, and removes the gate electrode from the boundary area BS. However, as explained in the first and second embodiments, it is possible to arbitrarily combine the presence/absence of overlapping, the presence/absence of a device isolation trench, and the presence/absence of removal of the gate electrode in the boundary area BS. Furthermore, the individual boundary areas of separate formation can have the same structure or different structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> An example of a method of fabricating a semiconductor device having the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</cross-reference> according to this embodiment will be described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A are the same as the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>B, etching is performed using a photoresist <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> which exposes a third transistor region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and its boundary area BS. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>C, this photoresist <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is removed, a third gate insulating film <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is deposited on the entire surface, and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is formed on this third gate insulating film <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is formed on the third transistor region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and its boundary area BS, and etching is performed. Consequently, a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is exposed in a first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is exposed from a boundary area BS to a second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>B, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is removed, and first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are formed in this order on the exposed surface. The first mask layer <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon nitride film, and the second mask layer <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon oxide film. After that, device isolation regions and gate electrodes are formed in the same manner as in the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> explained as the fabrication method of the first embodiment. In addition, although not shown, interlayer dielectric films, contact plugs, interconnections, and the like are formed to complete the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Since the method of this embodiment has no step in which a photoresist is in direct contact with a gate insulating film, so high reliability of a gate insulating film can be assured. Also, the structure of the boundary area BS of separate formation is not restricted to the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</cross-reference>; it is possible to use other structures explained in the first and second embodiments or combine a plurality of different structures. Furthermore, four or more types of gate insulating films and gate electrodes can be separately formed by the use of the method of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Next, an example of a method of fabricating the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</cross-reference> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> First, a sacrificial oxide film is formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. After a well impurity and a channel impurity are implanted as needed, this sacrificial oxide film is removed. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A, a</cross-reference> first gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> made of, e.g., polysilicon are formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32B, a</cross-reference> region to be a first transistor region TRI is covered with a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and the gate electrode layer and the gate insulating film in other regions are removed. The method of removal can be either isotropic etching such as wet etching or anisotropic etching such as RIE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>C, an oxide film <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film is formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32D, a</cross-reference> third transistor region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is covered with a photoresist <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, and the oxide film <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in other regions is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33A, a</cross-reference> second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>) are formed on the exposed surface. The second gate insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed on the oxide film <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to increase the thickness of this portion, thereby forming a third gate insulating film <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in the third transistor region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> can be different in material and film thickness. However, if the materials and film thicknesses of these layers are the same, gate electrodes are readily etched at the same time in the subsequent step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>B, regions to be second and third transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are covered with a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and the lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the second gate insulating film in other regions are removed. The method of removal can be either isotropic etching such as wet etching or anisotropic etching such as RIE. Etching is so performed that a portion of the photoresist reaches a boundary area BS on the side of the first transistor region TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the gate electrode stacked structure remains as it is in the boundary area BS of separate formation between the first and second transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>C, first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are deposited. The first mask layer <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon nitride film, and the second mask layer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon oxide film. After that, device isolation trenches and device isolation regions are formed by steps similar to the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Next, structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</cross-reference> are formed by steps similar to the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. A photoresist <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is then used as a gate electrode formation mask to process the gate electrodes in the same manner as in the step explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. Since the lower electrode layers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are the same layer in the boundary area BS between the second and third transistor regions TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, no film thickness difference is produced in this boundary area BS. Hence, the bottom of a device isolation region <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a step corresponding to the difference between the second and third gate insulating films. That is, that portion of this device isolation region <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in the boundary area BS, which is adjacent to the thick third transistor is shallower than that portion of the device isolation region <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which is adjacent to the second transistor. In addition, although not shown, interlayer dielectric films, contact plugs, interconnections, and the like are formed to complete the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the fabrication method of the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>A, in the fabrication method of the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>B, the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the second transistor region TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the third transistor region TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are simultaneously deposited. Since this omits a step of removal, the fabrication process can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> The structure of the boundary area BS of separate formation is not restricted to the structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</cross-reference>; it is possible to use other structures explained in the first and second embodiments or combine a plurality of different structures. Furthermore, four or more types of gate insulating films and gate electrodes can be separately formed by the use of the method of this embodiment. In addition, since only a gate insulating film of a high-voltage type transistor is directly coated with a photoresist, the number of the steps of separate formation can be reduced without impairing the reliability of a memory cell. </paragraph>

The MONOS memory cell and the LV transistor are separately formed by the method according to the first to third embodiments, and their boundary area BS has a shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, for example.

In the HV transistor region HV, an HV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and an HV gate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is formed on this HV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> On the two sides of the gate electrode in each of these regions MC, LV, and HV, a side-wall insulating film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> which is, e.g., a 5- to 200-nm thick silicon nitride film or silicon oxide film is formed. Also, source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as n-diffusion layers are formed on the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. These source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the memory cell gate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> form a MONOS nonvolatile EEPROM cell. The gate length of the charge storage layer is, e.g., 0.01 to 0.5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> These source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are formed to a depth of, e.g., 10 to 500 nm by using phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony such that the surface concentration is 10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>. Furthermore, these source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are connected in series between memory cells to realize a NAND connection. A source/drain diffusion layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at one end of the selector gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is connected to a data transfer line <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> via a contact plug <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The selector gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is formed by the same layers as the control gate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the memory cell gate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The contact plug is filled with n- or p-doped polysilicon or tungsten, and tungsten, Al, TiN, or Ti, and functions as a conductor region. The data transfer line <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is made of tungsten, tungsten silicide, titanium, titanium nitride, or aluminum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The selector gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> opposes the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> having the same structure as the charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the memory cell gate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a selection transistor. The gate length of the selector gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is larger than that of the memory cell gate and is, e.g., 0.02 to 1 &mgr;m. This ensures a high ON/OFF ratio between block selection and non-selection, and prevents write and read errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> These elements are filled with an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or SiN interlayer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. On top of this interlayer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, an insulating film protective layer (not shown) made of, e.g., SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SiN, or polyimide and an upper interconnection (not shown) made of, e.g., W, Al, or Cu are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Between the memory cell region MC and the LV transistor region LV, a first device isolation region <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> having the structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is formed. Between the LV transistor region LV and the HV transistor region HV, a second device isolation region <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> having the structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</cross-reference> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Contact plugs <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are connected to the source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in the LV transistor region LV. These contact plugs <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are connected to interconnections <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Also, contact plugs <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are connected to the source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in the HV transistor region HV. These contact plugs <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are connected to interconnections <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Since this embodiment uses a MONOS EEPROM cell, the write voltage and erase voltage can be made lower than those in a floating gate type EEPROM to be described later. Therefore, in the peripheral circuit transistors, the breakdown voltage can be maintained even if the gate insulating film is thinned by narrowing the device isolation spacing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> This can reduce the sarface area of a circuit to which a high voltage is applied and can further reduce the chip area. Furthermore, compared to a floating gate type memory cell, the thickness of the charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be decreased to 20 nm or less. Since this reduces the aspect ratio during gate formation, it is possible to improve the gate electrode processing shape and the inter-gate filling characteristics of the interlayer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. This improves the breakdown voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Also, a process for forming a floating gate electrode and a slit formation process are unnecessary, so the fabrication process can be further shortened. In addition, the charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is an insulator, and electric charge is trapped in each individual charge trap. This gives high resistance to this charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> because electric charge is not easily extracted by radiation. Furthermore, even when the side-wall insulating film of the charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is thinned, electric charge trapped in this charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is not entirely extracted. This maintains good holding characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The selection transistor shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> has the same MONOS structure as the memory cell transistor. In this case, steps for separately forming these selection transistor and memory cell transistor can be omitted, so the fabrication cost is reduced. In addition, since no margin for separate formation need be formed, the distance between the selection transistor and the memory cell can be decreased. This can reduce the device area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, no gate insulating film is present on the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on which no gate is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> shows a modification of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. In this modification, instead of the first device isolation region <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35, a</cross-reference> gate structure <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is formed in a boundary area BS between a memory cell region MC and an LV transistor region LV. On a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in this gate structure <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of a selector gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is formed on a side close to the memory cell region MC, and an LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is formed on a side far from the memory cell region MC. Between the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and the LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, a gate electrode material is formed in direct contact with the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. An insulating film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is formed on the side walls of this gate structure. The gate structure <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is formed by the same method as for forming the electrode layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in the boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>B, by changing the compositions of the insulating film and conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> shows another modification of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. This structure is the same as the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> except that when a gate electrode close to a memory cell region MC is processed, a gate insulating film is not simultaneously processed but is left behind. That is, in the memory cell region MC and its adjacent boundary area BS, a tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and a charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> As the structure of the boundary area BS between the memory cell region MC and an LV transistor region LV shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>H can be used. These structures can also be applied to a boundary area BS between the memory cell region MC and an HV transistor region HV by switching an LV gate insulating film and an HV gate insulating film. That is, the structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>H are applicable to a boundary area BS in a NAND MONOS semiconductor memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> In each boundary area BS, the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be exposed without forming any gate insulating film. This structure can be applied to the boundary areas BS in the semiconductor devices shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 36</cross-reference>. Each boundary area BS can have a structure in which no diffusion layers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are formed. Also, the individual boundary structures of separate formation can be the same structure or can be different structures in different places. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> In the boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A, a</cross-reference> device isolation region <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> similar to the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is formed in a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. On the memory cell region MC side of this device isolation region <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, a tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and a charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed. On the two sides of the device isolation region <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are formed in the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Steps including a projection projecting upward are formed on the bottom of the trench of the device isolation region <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. By using the structure of this boundary area BS, it is possible to improve the STI filling properties, prevent dishing, and reduce the area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> In the boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>B, the same gate structure as the selector gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is formed to cover the device isolation region <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</cross-reference>.

On a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the center of this boundary area BS, a gate structure <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is formed by the constituent materials of the gate structures in a memory cell region MC and an LV transistor region LV. On the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in this gate structure <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, an ONO film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is formed on the side of the memory cell region MC, and an LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is formed on the side of the LV transistor region LV. An electrode layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a side-wall insulating film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, and the like are formed on the ONO film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and the insulating film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. On the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the gate structure <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to the memory cell region MC, a tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and a charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed. On the two sides of the gate structure <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are formed in the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. By using the structure of this boundary area BS, it is possible to facilitate gate processing and avoid defects caused by STI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> The boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40F</cross-reference> has a structure similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. On a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the center of this boundary area BS, a gate structure <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> formed by the constituent materials of gate structures in a memory cell region MC and an LV transistor region LV is formed. On the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in this gate structure <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, an ONO film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is formed on the side of the memory cell region MC, and an LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is formed on the side of the LV transistor region LV. On the ONO film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, the same stacked gate structure as a control gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is formed. On the LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, a lower structure of an LV gate <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is formed. An insulating film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is formed on the side surfaces of this gate structure <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. By the use of the structure of this boundary area BS, it is possible to reduce dust and avoid defects caused by STI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> The boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40G</cross-reference> has a structure similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference>. A recess <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is formed in the surface of a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the center of this boundary area BS. On the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from this recess <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> toward a memory cell region MC, a tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and a charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed. By the use of the structure of this boundary area BS, it is possible to reduce dust and avoid defects caused by STI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> The boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40H</cross-reference> has a structure similar to the gate structure <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference>. Although a recess is formed in the surface of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at the center of the boundary area, the center can be flat as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference>. In this gate structure, an electrode layer is in direct contact with the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> without any insulating film between them. By using the structure of this boundary area BS, it is possible to facilitate gate processing, reduce dust, avoid defects caused by STI, and match the aspect ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</cross-reference> shows a sectional view, on the gate of the memory cell, taken along a direction perpendicular to the data transfer line. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</cross-reference> shows a sectional view, on the gate of the peripheral transistor, taken along a direction perpendicular to the data transfer line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A and 41B</cross-reference>, the side surfaces of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and gate insulating films are covered with a device isolation region <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> from coming lower than the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, while the ends of the device isolation region are not exposed by etching before the formation of the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, in both the memory cell and the peripheral transistor. This is so because this structure is formed by a self-aligned STI method. This makes electric filed concentration or a parasitic transistor having a decreased threshold value difficult to form in the boundary between the device isolation region <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> the tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In addition, a sidewalk phenomenon which is a lowering of the write threshold value resulting from a bird beak does not easily occur. Accordingly, a highly reliable transistor can be formed. </paragraph>

A block insulating film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> which is a silicon oxide film having a thickness of, e.g., 2 to 10 nm is formed.

<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>C, the LV and HV transistor regions (peripheral circuit regions) are covered with a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, and the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the LV gate insulating film in other regions are removed. The method of removal can be either isotropic etching such as wet etching or anisotropic etching such as RIE. Etching is so performed that a portion of the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> reaches the memory cell region MC. Accordingly, the gate electrode stacked structure remains as it is in a boundary area BS of separate formation between the memory cell region MC and the peripheral circuit region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is removed, and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>A, first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are deposited. The first mask layer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon nitride film, and the second mask layer <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon oxide film. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47B, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> for forming device isolation regions is deposited, and device isolation patterns are formed. In the following description, a method of forming device isolation regions in the boundary areas BS of separate formation without leaving resists in those portions will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>C, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are removed by anisotropic etching, and then the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is removed by anisotropic etching. Subsequently, to form device isolation regions, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is etched to form device isolation trenches <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The depth of these device isolation trenches <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is, e.g., about 50 to 300 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> In the boundary area BS of separate formation between the memory cell region MC and the LV transistor region LV, the step produced in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46B</cross-reference> remains in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>B and forms an upward projection on the bottom of the device isolation region. Although the height of this projection depends upon the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>B and the etching conditions, this height is, e.g., about 10 to 300 nm, and desirably, about 30 to 100 nm. The depth of the device isolation trench also depends upon a region in contact with the trench. This depth reflects the differences between the ONO film thickness in the memory cell region MC, the gate insulating film thickness in the LV transistor region LV, and the gate insulating film thickness in the HV transistor region HV; the thinner the gate insulating film, the deeper the device isolation trench. In the boundary area BS of separate formation between the LV transistor region LV and the HV transistor region HV, the depth of the bottom of the device isolation trench <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> changes from one place to another, since the step produced in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46B</cross-reference> remains in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>A, the device isolation trenches <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> are filled with an insulating film such as a silicon oxide film, and this buried material is etched back by a method such as CMP by using the first mask layer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> as a stopper. Since the device isolation regions in the boundary areas BS are deep, the filling properties are excellent. After etch back, therefore, the upper portion of the device isolation insulating film is almost flat. After the first mask layer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is removed, a gate electrode layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is deposited on the entire exposed surface. This gate electrode layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is a polysilicon film, a stacked film of polysilicon and a metal or a silicon and metal compound, or a single-layered film of a metal or a silicon and metal compound. A mask insulating film <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> which is a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film having a thickness of about 10 to 300 nm is further deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B, a</cross-reference> photoresist layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> for processing the gate electrodes is deposited and patterned. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>C, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to anisotropically etch the gate electrodes. After that, damage by the processing is recovered by post-oxidation or the like. A gate side-wall insulating film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is formed if necessary, and a diffusion layer impurity is implanted to form source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> In this case, no resist is left behind in the boundary areas BS, and the gate electrodes are removed from the boundary areas BS. Note that it is also possible to deposit a mask layer such as a silicon nitride film or silicon oxide film on the gate electrode layers and process the gate electrode layers by using this mask layer. After that, although not shown, interlayer dielectric films, contact plugs, interconnections, and the like are formed to complete the semiconductor device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to form a twin-well structure in which a first well having a conductivity type opposite to that of a semiconductor substrate is formed on the semiconductor substrate, and a second well having the same conductivity type as the semiconductor layer is formed on the first well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, it is possible to obtain the same effects as in the first to third embodiments. In addition, the transistors forming the peripheral circuit are exemplified by two types of transistors having the MOS structure and differing in gate oxide film thickness. Note that this embodiment is also applicable to a case in which transistors forming the peripheral circuit have three or more different gate oxide film thicknesses. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor device of this embodiment is applied to a NAND EEPROM, NOR EEPROM, AND EEPROM, or Virtual Ground Array EEPROM each having a MONOS cell structure as a nonvolatile memory. A floating gate type nonvolatile memory requires at least three types of transistors: a memory cell transistor forming a memory cell, a MOS transistor (to be referred to as an LV transistor hereinafter) forming a low-voltage peripheral circuit and having a relatively thin gate oxide film, and a MOS transistor (to be referred to an HV transistor hereinafter) forming a high-voltage peripheral circuit and having a relatively thick gate oxide film. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> A floating gate type memory cell and an LV transistor are separately formed by the method according to the first to third embodiments, and a boundary area BS between them has the shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>, for example. However, as explained in the first to third embodiments, it is possible to arbitrarily combine the presence/absence of overlapping, the presence/absence of a device isolation trench, and the presence/absence of removal of the gate electrode in the boundary area BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device having the sectional view shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49, a</cross-reference> memory cell region MC, a low-voltage (LV) transistor region LV, a high-voltage (HV) transistor region HV, and boundary areas BS between them are formed on a p-semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which contains boron at an impurity concentration of, e.g., 10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>. In this substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, an n-well <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>and a p-well <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>p </italic></highlight>are formed. When the p-well <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>p </italic></highlight>is thus formed in the n-well <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, a voltage can be applied to the p-well <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>p </italic></highlight>independently of the p-semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Consequently, it is possible to reduce the booster circuit load during erasure and reduce the power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> In the memory cell region MC, a charge storage layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is formed via a tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. This tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a 3- to 15-nm thick silicon oxide film or oxynitride film. The charge storage layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is made of, e.g., 10- to 500-nm thick polysilicon to which 10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>of phosphorus or arsenic is added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> A device isolation insulating film <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</cross-reference>) of, e.g., a silicon oxide film is formed to be self-aligned with the charge storage layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. For example, after the tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and the charge storage layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are deposited on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, patterning is performed to etch the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to a depth of 50 to 300 nm until the surface of this semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is exposed, and an insulating film is buried. Since the tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and the charge storage layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can be formed on the entire flat surface having no steps, these films have improved uniformity and uniform characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> On top of this charge storage layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, a control gate electrode <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is formed via an inter-poly dielectric film <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. This inter-poly dielectric film <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a 5- to 30-nm thick silicon oxide film, oxynitride film, or silicon oxide film/silicon nitride film/silicon oxide film. The gate electrode <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> has a thickness of, e.g., 10 to 500 nm, and is made of polysilicon doped with 10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>of phosphorus, arsenic, or boron or has a stacked structure of WSi (tungsten silicide) and polysilicon, or a stacked structure of NiSi, MoSi, TiSi, or CoSi and polysilicon.

A mask insulating film which is a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film having a thickness of about 10 to 300 nm is formed on the control gate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In the LV transistor region LV, an LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and an LV gate electrode <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is formed on this LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. In the HV transistor region HV, an HV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and an HV gate electrode <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is formed on this HV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. In each of the LV and HV transistor regions LV and HV, a terminal is disposed to apply an electric potential to a gate electrode in contact with the gate insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>, on the two sides of these gate electrodes, a side-wall insulating film <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> which is, e.g., a 5- to 200-nm thick silicon nitride film or silicon oxide film is formed. Also, n-source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> are formed on the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. These source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> are formed to a depth of, e.g., 10 to 500 nm by using phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony such that the surface concentration is 10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>. Furthermore, these source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> are connected in series between memory cells to realize a NAND connection. The source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the memory cell gate <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, and the selector gate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> form a floating gate type EEPROM cell which uses a charge amount stored in the charge storage layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> as an information amount. The gate length is, e.g., 0.01 to 0.5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> A source/drain diffusion layer <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> at one end of the selector gate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is connected to a data transfer line <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> via a contact plug <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. The data transfer line <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is made of tungsten, tungsten silicide, titanium, titanium nitride, or aluminum. The contact plug <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> is filled with n- or p-doped polysilicon or tungsten, and tungsten, Al, TiN, or Ti, and functions as a conductor region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> The selector gate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> forms a selection transistor. The gate length of the selector gate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is larger than that of the memory cell gate <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and is, e.g., 0.02 to 1 &mgr;m. This ensures a high ON/OFF ratio between block selection and non-selection, and prevents write and read errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> These elements are filled with an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or SiN interlayer <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>.

Also, contact plugs <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are connected to the source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in the HV transistor region HV.

<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> The selection transistor shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> has the same stacked structure as the memory cell transistor. In this case, steps for separately forming these selection transistor and memory cell transistor can be omitted, so the fabrication cost is reduced. In addition, since no margin for separate formation need be formed, the distance between the selection transistor and the memory cell can be decreased. This can reduce the device area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>, no gate insulating film is present on the substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> on which no gate is formed. </paragraph>

A side-wall insulating film <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> is formed around this HV gate <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. That is, although the transistor and selection transistor forming the peripheral circuit have the same stacked gates as the memory cell in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>, these stacked gates can also be single-layered gates as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference> shows another modification of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>.

That is, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49 and 50</cross-reference>, no gate insulating film exists in a region in which the gate electrode is etched.

By using the structure of this boundary area BS, it is possible to facilitate gate processing and avoid defects caused by STI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> The boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52F</cross-reference> has a structure similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. On a substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in the center of this boundary area BS, a gate structure <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> is formed by the constituent materials of gate structures in a memory cell region MC and an LV transistor region LV. On the substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in this gate structure <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>, a tunnel insulating film <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is formed on the side of the memory cell region MC, and an LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is formed on the side of the LV transistor region LV. On the tunnel insulating film <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, the same stacked gate structure as the control gate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is formed. On the LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, a lower structure of the LV gate <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is formed. An insulating film <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> is formed on the side surfaces of this gate structure <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. By the use of the structure of this boundary area BS, it is possible to reduce dust and avoid defects caused by STI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> The boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52G</cross-reference> has a structure similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference>. A recess <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is formed in the surface of a substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in the center of this boundary area BS. By the use of the structure of this boundary area BS, it is possible to reduce dust and avoid defects caused by STI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> The boundary area BS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52H</cross-reference> has the same structure as the gate structure <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference>. Although a recess is formed in the surface of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> at the center of the boundary area, the center can be flat as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference>. In this gate structure, an electrode layer is in direct contact with the surface of a substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> without any insulating film between them. By using the structure of this boundary area BS, it is possible to facilitate gate processing, reduce dust, avoid defects caused by STI, and match the aspect ratios. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53A and 53B</cross-reference>, the side surfaces of the substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and gate insulating films are covered with device isolation regions <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the gate electrode <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> from coming lower than the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, while the ends of the device isolation region are not exposed by etching before the formation of the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, in both the memory cell and the peripheral transistor. This makes electric filed concentration or a parasitic transistor having a decreased threshold value difficult to form in the boundary between the device isolation region <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> the tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. In addition, a sidewalk phenomenon which is a lowering of the write threshold value resulting from a bird beak does not easily occur. Accordingly, a highly reliable transistor can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> An example of a method of fabricating the nonvolatile semiconductor memory of this embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> will be explained below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>C. First, a sacrificial oxide film (not shown) is formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. After a well impurity and a channel impurity are implanted as needed, this sacrificial oxide film is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54A, a</cross-reference> 3- to 15-nm thick tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film or oxynitride film is formed. Then, a 10- to 500-nm thick charge storage layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> made of, e.g., polysilicon is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54B, a</cross-reference> region to be a memory cell region MC is covered with a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, and the gate electrode and the gate insulating film in other regions are removed. The method of removal can be either isotropic etching such as wet etching or anisotropic etching such as RIE. Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54C, a</cross-reference> 5- to 50-nm thick HV-transistor gate insulating film <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film or oxynitride film is formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>A, an HV transistor region HV is covered with a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, and the gate insulating film of this HV transistor region HV is removed from other regions. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55B, a</cross-reference> 1- to 10-nm thick LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> such as a silicon oxide film or oxynitride film is formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. 10- to 500-nm thick polysilicon is deposited on this gate insulating film <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> In this state, the memory cell region MC has a stacked structure in which the LV-transistor gate insulating film <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and a first gate electrode <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> are stacked on the gate electrode of the memory cell. Also, the film thickness of the HV-transistor gate insulating film <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> formed in advance increases. The gate electrodes of the memory cell and the LV transistor can be different in material and film thickness. However, if the materials and film thicknesses of these gate electrodes are the same, the gate electrodes are readily etched at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>C, the LV and HV transistor regions (peripheral circuit regions) are covered with a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>, and the gate electrode and the gate insulating film in other regions are removed. The method of removal can be either isotropic etching such as wet etching or anisotropic etching such as RIE. Etching is so performed that a portion of the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> reaches the memory cell region MC. Accordingly, the gate electrode stacked structure remains as it is in a boundary area BS of separate formation between the memory cell region MC and the peripheral circuit region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference>A, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> is removed, and first and second mask layers <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> are deposited. The first mask layer <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon nitride film, and the second mask layer <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> is, e.g., a silicon oxide film. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56B, a</cross-reference> photoresist mask <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> for forming device isolation regions is deposited, and device isolation patterns are formed. In the following description, a method of forming device isolation regions in the boundary areas BS of separate formation without leaving resists in those portions will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> Next, the photoresist mask <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and the second mask layer <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> are removed by anisotropic etching, and then the first gate electrodes <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> are removed by anisotropic etching. Subsequently, to form device isolation regions, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is etched to form first and second device isolation trenches. The depth of these device isolation trenches is, e.g., about 50 to 300 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> In the boundary area BS of separate formation, the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56B</cross-reference> forms an upward projection on the bottom of the device isolation region. Although the height of this projection depends upon the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference>B and the etching conditions, this height is about 10 to 300 nm, and desirably, about 30 to 100 nm. The depth of the device isolation trench also depends upon a region in contact with the trench. This depth reflects the differences between the tunnel insulating film thickness in the memory cell region MC, the gate insulating film thickness in the LV transistor region LV, and the gate insulating film thickness in the HV transistor region HV; the thinner the gate insulating film, the deeper the device isolation trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> The device isolation trenches are filled with an insulating film such as a silicon oxide film, and this buried material is etched back by a method such as CMP by using the first mask layer <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> as a stopper. Since the device isolation regions in the boundary areas BS are shallow, the filling properties are excellent. After etch back, therefore, the upper portions of the device isolation insulating films are almost flat. The first mask layer <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is removed, and the first gate electrode <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> in the LV transistor region LV and the HV transistor region HV is given the same film thickness as the charge storage layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. After that, the insulating films buried in the device isolation trenches are etched back. The structure at this time is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57A, a</cross-reference> 5- to 30-nm thick inter-poly-insulting film <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> which is a silicon oxide film, oxynitride film, or silicon oxide film/silicon nitride film/silicon oxide film is formed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57B, a</cross-reference> gate electrode <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is deposited on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. This gate electrode <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is a polysilicon film, a stacked film of polysilicon and a metal or a silicon and metal compound, or a single-layered film of a metal or a silicon and metal compound. Subsequently, a mask insulating film which is a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film having a thickness of about 10 to 300 nm is deposited. A photoresist layer <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> for processing the gate electrodes is then deposited and patterned. This photoresist layer <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to anisotropically etch the gate electrodes. After that, damage by the processing is recovered by post-oxidation or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57C, a</cross-reference> gate side-wall insulating film <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> is formed as needed, and a diffusion layer impurity is implanted to form source/drain diffusion layers <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. In this case, no resist is left behind in the boundary areas BS, and the gate electrodes are removed from these boundary areas BS. After that, although not shown, interlayer dielectric films, contact plugs, interconnections, and the like are formed to complete the semiconductor device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> In the fabrication method of this embodiment, the effects of the first to third embodiments and the fabrication method according to the fourth embodiment can be similarly obtained in addition to the effects unique to MONOS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> (Sixth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is applied to an AND EEPROM having a MONOS memory cell structure, as indicated by the sectional structure of a boundary area BS and its vicinity shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference> is still another modification of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. In this modification, the boundary area BS is formed between a memory cell region MC and a selection transistor region STR for a memory cell. In this boundary area BS, a recess <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is formed in the surface of a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as in the structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40G and 15A</cross-reference>. A tunnel gate insulating film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and a charge storage layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the recess <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> toward the memory cell region MC. A gate insulating film of a selection transistor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> can be desirably in common with an LV gate insulating film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to simplify the fabrication process. An equivalent circuit of a memory block is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The structure of the boundary area BS can be any of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>H. That is, a preferred form can be selected from the viewpoints of the number of steps and the ease of processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59A</cross-reference> shows a sectional view, on the gate of the memory cell, taken along a direction perpendicular to the data transfer line. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59B</cross-reference> shows a sectional view, on the gate of the selection transistor, taken along a direction perpendicular to the data transfer line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59A and 59B</cross-reference>, the side surfaces of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are covered with device isolation regions <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> from coming lower than the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, while the ends of the device isolation region are not exposed by etching before the formation of the ONO film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, in both the memory cell and the peripheral transistor. This makes gate concentration or a parasitic transistor having a decreased threshold value difficult to form in the boundary between the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the ONO film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. In addition, a sidewalk phenomenon which is a lowering of the write threshold value resulting from a bird beak does not easily occur. Accordingly, a highly reliable transistor can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Since the selection transistor is a MOS transistor, the threshold value does not fluctuate owing to the voltage stress for operation. This realizes a highly reliable nonvolatile memory. This embodiment can also achieve the same effects as in the first to third embodiments and the fourth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> In each of the above embodiments, a memory cell transistor is formed before a peripheral circuit transistor. However, the order of separate formation is not limited to this one, so a peripheral circuit transistor can be formed first. Also, in the fourth to sixth embodiments, a memory cell region MC and an LV transistor region LV, and an HV transistor region HV and the LV transistor region are adjacent to each other via boundary areas. However, the arrangement of these adjacent regions is not restricted to these. For example, the memory cell region MC and the HV transistor region HV can be adjacent to each other via a boundary area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
