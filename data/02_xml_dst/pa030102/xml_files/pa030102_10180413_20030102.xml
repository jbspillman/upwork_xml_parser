<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a coil for a magnetic resonance system, having an antenna with which a magnetic resonance excitation signal can be emitted and/or a magnetic resonance signal can be received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Coils of the above type are well-known. They are employed both rigidly mounted at the system and as loosely arranged local coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Given such a coil, it is important to identify its presence in the magnetic resonance system. When a coil element of a coil is situated within an excitation field of the magnetic resonance system, it can lead to great stresses on the surrounding tissue due to a locally elevated RF excitation field if it is not appropriately detuned by a control signal. Identification of which coils are present in the system and which are not present therein must be made in order to be able to correctly operate the coils that are present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A known identification technique is to acquire the presence of the coils via terminal plugs. In the prior art, the terminal plugs are individually coded at the coil side in order to be able to determine which coils are situated in the magnetic resonance system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This known procedure is disadvantageous because, first, only connected coils can be identified and, second, there is only a limited number of coding possibilities by means of the terminal plugs. For example, 256 coil types can be distinguished given eight contact bridges that are optionally plugged or not plugged. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a coil for a magnetic resonance system that can always be identified and that offers expanded coding possibilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved in accordance with the invention in a coil for magnetic resonance system having a transponder from which data that are characteristic of the coil can be emitted given electromagnetic excitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When the transponder is fashioned as passive transponder, the transponder does not require its own energy source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When the transponder transmits coil-characteristic data given excitation with a frequency within the bandwidth of the excitation coil, but beyond the magnetic resonance frequency range, it can be excited&mdash;without modifications&mdash;by the magnetic resonance system to transmit the coil-characteristic data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The coil-characteristic data can include different types of information. A type code for the coil, a serial number for the coil, an internal system code for the coil, a system code and operation-specific data are examples.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a magnetic resonance system (not shown) has an antenna <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A magnetic resonance excitation signal can be emitted and/or a magnetic resonance signal can be received with the antenna <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Typically these are RF signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A transponder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is arranged on the coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The transponder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is preferably composed of anti-magnetic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the transponder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a reception resonant circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The reception resonant circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be electromagnetically excited with a suitable excitation frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The excitation frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is basically arbitrarily selectable. In particular, it can be equal to the Larmor frequency of the magnetic resonance system. The excitation frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, however, also can be a different frequency that the magnetic resonance system can generate. For hydrogen, the most frequent application, the Larmor frequency amounts to 42 MHz/T multiplied by the basic magnetic field of the magnetic resonance system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Given excitation with the excitation frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an operating voltage U builds up in a power supply device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Due to suitable buffering, for example with a storage capacitor, the operating voltage U is maintained for some time after the end of the excitation with the excitation frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A micro-controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a memory <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> thus also can be operated for a limited time beyond the end of the electromagnetic excitation, even though the transponder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fashioned as passive transponder, i.e. it does not include its own energy source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The micro-controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> drives a transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so that it oscillates with a transmission frequency f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> modulates the oscillation of the transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> according to the content of the memory <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which it reads out for this purpose. The reception resonant circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the transponder also may be employed as the transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As a result, simultaneous transmission and reception of the transponder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and reloading of energy into the transponder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the memory <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). A type code <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a serial number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an internal system code <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for the coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a system code <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as well as operation-specific data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are stored in the memory <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The type code <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is characteristic of the type of coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. It can, for example, be composed of a manufacturer code and an ordering number. The serial number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is simply a running number that serves for distinguishing between the individual coils of a particular type. Each coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> thus can be distinguished from other coils by means of the combination of the type code <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> with the serial number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The internal system code <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is usually a number assigned within the magnetic resonance system for a specific coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The system code <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a code for the magnetic resonance system to which the coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> belongs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The operation-specific data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> include, for example, data about the date of manufacture of the coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or its age, settings, when the next maintenance is due and how often the coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has already been used and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With the inventive coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a comprehensive identification of each coil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is not galvanically connected to the magnetic resonance system is also possible in a simple way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Although modifications and changes may be suggested by those skilled in the art, it is the intention of the inventors to embody within the patent warranted hereon all changes and modifications as reasonably and properly come within the scope of their contribution to the art. </paragraph>
