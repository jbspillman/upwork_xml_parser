<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to electronic power converters. More particularly, this invention relates to control of the input and output of electronic converters. Still more particularly, this invention relates to a system and apparatus for controlling electronic power converters using, random pulse width modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. The Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Electronic power converters include AC/DC converters also known as rectifiers and DC/AC converters also known as inverters. Typically, an electronic power converter is a network of semiconductor power switches. The fundamental component of output voltage of an electronic power converter is controlled by opening and closing individual switches in the network. The opening and closing of the individual switches is controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM) of switching signals applied to the individual switches. The distribution of the switching signals in time is referred to as a switching pattern. PWM may also be used to make current drawn from an AC supply source sinusoidal and in phase, with the supply voltage which maximizes utilization of the current in a rectifier. In inverters, appropriate width modulation of the switching pulses reduces the distortion of the output voltage and current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One example of a system that uses electronic power converters controlled by PWM is an adjustable speed AC drive. Typically, an adjustable speed AC driver includes a rectifier, a DC link, an inverter and an AC motor. The rectifier converts input AC voltage from a power grid into a DC voltage. PWM or phase control may be used to control the rectifier. Alternatively, the rectifier may be uncontrolled. The DC link connects the rectifier to the inverter. The DC link is a capacitive or inductive-capacitive low-pass filter. The inverter receives the DC voltage from the DC link and converts the DC voltage to a three-phase, adjustable frequency, and adjustable magnitude AC voltage. PWM is used to control the inverter. The AC voltage is then applied to the AC motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In most electronic power converters controlled by PWM, the switching frequency is constant. The switching frequency is the number of switching cycles per second and per switch. In a rectifier, the switching frequency is typically two orders of magnitude higher than the input frequency. In an inverter, the switching frequency is typically two orders of magnitude higher than the output frequency. The switching cycles are also typically coincident with sampling cycles of a digital pulse width modulator controlling the converter. The coincidence of the switching and sampling cycles makes the switching frequency constant substantially equal to the sampling frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Coincident cycles are a solution of convenience for makers of electronic power converters. However, coincident cycles may cause many problems. One problem with a constant switching frequency is the constant switching frequency results in clusters of higher harmonics in power spectra of voltages and currents of a converter at multiples of the frequency. These harmonics may cause undesirable side effects in systems connected to the input and outputs of the converter. For example, an adjustable speed AC drive having an inverter that is pulse width modified may have harmonic torques and forces generated in the motor that produce tonal noise and increase susceptibility of the drive to vibration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Harmonic components of current from a power grid may cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) that is radiated into space surrounding the converter and is conducted to the grid. The EMI is concentrated in distinct narrow bands and may disrupt operations in sensitive communications equipment exposed to the EMI. These disruptions may be reduced by adding a special filter that may increase the expense and complexity of the equipment. There is a need in the art for a method of controlling an electronic power converter with PWM that reduces this and other problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Random Pulse Width Modulation (RPWM) techniques have been used to control electronic power converters. RPWM techniques have been described in &ldquo;Random Pulse Width Modulation Techniques for Converter-Fed Drive Systems&mdash;A Review&rdquo; A. M Trzynadlowski et al., <highlight><italic>IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, </italic></highlight>Vol. 30, No. 5, pp. 1166-1175, 1994. An RPWM technique is characterized by random variations of the switching frequency. The random variations of the frequency alleviate undesirable components in PWM electronic power converters. Specifically, the fundamental AC component in PWM higher harmonics remains unchanged. However, the spectral power, measured in Watts, is converted to continuous power density, measured in Watts per Hertz, instead of being concentrated in the higher harmonics. The power spectra of the output voltage and current from a RPWM power converter emulate the spectrum of white noise. Consequently, spurious phenomena are significantly mitigated. Some examples of spurious phenomena mitigated include tonal acoustic noise, radiated EMI, and conducted EMI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In most applications, a PWM converter is part of a larger control system. An example of these control systems is a digital speed or position controller of an electric drive. In order to provide PWM, a modulator connected to the converter must be provided with a reference signal of the output voltage prior to the beginning of a switching cycle in which a voltage will be generated by the power converter. This signal is typically produced by a control system in a sampling cycle preceding the switching cycle for which the signal is used. Thus, period of coincidental sampling and switching cycle are of the same length whether the sampling cycle is constant or of random length. This allows a modulator to receive signals for the reference voltage in time to compute and generate a switching pattern for the next switching cycle. It is a problem in systems having a random length of switching periods that this method requires the sampling cycle to vary by the same amount as the switching cycles. The use of identically varying sampling and switching cycles is easy to implement. However, these cycles are inferior to systems with constant sampling frequencies. A constant sampling frequency is superior because the constant frequencies represent a fixed level representing an optimal trade-off between various operating requirements. For this reason, RPWM has been a less desirable alternative for providing PWM in electrical power converters. Therefore, there is a need in the art for a system that provides the advantages of RPWM while taking advantage of constant sampling cycles. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The above and other problems are solved and an advance in the art is made through a method and apparatus for random pulse width modulation of an electronic power converter in accordance with this invention. In accordance with this invention, a method for Random Pulse Width Modulation (RPWM) is provided having constant periods for sampling cycles and random periods for sampling cycles. This method of RPWM is flexible and allows shaping of the frequency spectrum of the output voltage and input current of a power converter. This shaping optimizes the mitigation of spurious side effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this invention, a modulator having a processor or microprocessor executing instructions stored in memory provides a method of RPWM. Alternatively, the modulator has circuitry that performs these steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> RPWM is provided in the following manner. The method begins by determining a switching period randomly for a switching cycle subsequent to a current sampling cycle. The method then determines a switching pattern from a reference voltage generated from sample signals detected and processed in the current sampling cycle. Switching signals are then generated to make a specific switching pattern. The switching signals are then transmitted to switches of the converter during the switching cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance to the method of this invention, the switching period may be determined by calculating the switching period. In one exemplary embodiment, the calculation of the period may start by generating a first random number. A first delay between the switching cycle and a coincident sampling cycle is determined by multiplying the random number by the period of the coincident sampling cycle. A second random number is generated and multiplied by the period of a sampling cycle to determine the second delay. The second delay is the delay for the switching cycle subsequent to the cycle being calculated. The period of the switching cycle is then calculated by subtracting the first delay from the period of the sampling cycle and adding the second delay to the result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The start time of the switching cycle is then calculated by adding the first delay to the start time of the coincident sampling cycle. The switching signals are then transmitted to the converter from the start time until the calculated period expires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Sometimes the period of the switching cycle may be too short for calculation of the switching signals. Therefore, a comparison of the calculated switching period with a specific minimum allowable value of this period may be required. This minimum allowable value is hereinafter referred to as a switching period minimum. If the calculated switching period is less than the switching period minimum, the switching period is changed to the minimum switching period. If the period is changed to the minimum switching period the delay for the subsequent switching period must be adjusted. In the exemplary embodiment, the calculation of the second delay for the subsequent switching period is completed by subtracting the sample period from the switching period and adding the first delay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The reference voltage may be received from a control system that generates the reference voltage from sample signals received in a previous sampling cycle. </paragraph>

Rectifier <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> receives the voltage from filter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via path <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and converts the voltage to a DC voltage. The DC voltage is then applied to a DC link <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via path <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. DC link <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> provides the DC voltage for three-phase inverter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> via path <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>.

One skilled in the art will recognize that control system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and modulator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be different application executed by the same processor, combined circuitry on a single chip or integrated in some other way without deviating from this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method for providing RPWM for a power converter, such as three-phase inverter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. In accordance with this invention, RPWM is provided with switching cycles having varying periods and sampling cycles having constant periods. One skilled in the art will recognize that this method of providing RPWM is not limited to application of three-phase inverters and may be used to provide RPWM to any type of power converters with minimal changes to the processing steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, modulator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has a processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that this invention may be implemented as well in firmware, or hard-wired circuitry. Processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a processing unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Processing unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is a processor, microprocessor, or a group of processors and/ or microprocessors that execute instruction stored in memory to provide applications. Processing unit is connected to a volatile and non-volatile memory via memory bus <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. A volatile memory such as Random Access Memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, stores data and instructions for applications executed by processing unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. A non-volatile memory, such as Read Only Memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, stores instructions and configuration information for processing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Input/Output (I/O) bus <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> connects processing unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to peripheral device to exchange data between processing unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the devices. Examples of devices connected to processing unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> include memory <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, I/O device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, network interface <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, display <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and Digital to Analog (D/A) converter <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>.

One skilled in the art will recognize that another type of interface may be used to connect processing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to switches inside inverter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary power circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in three-phase inverter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Positive input terminal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and negative input terminal <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> connect to DC link <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Output terminals <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> connect to motor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Power circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes six power conductor switches <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. Each switch receives switching signals via a respective path <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Switches <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> are grouped into complementary pairs. The pairs are switches <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, switches <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and switches <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Each switch receives a complementary signal from the signal received by the complement of the switch. For example, when switch <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> receives a one or a high signal, switch <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> receives a zero or low signal. This prevents switches in the group from being simultaneously on or off. Thus, inverter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may be in any of eight switch configurations. One skilled in the art will recognize that the power circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may also be in a rectifier. When circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is used in a rectifier, a three-phase AC power supply is applied to terminals <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and output DC appears on positive terminal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and negative terminal <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Two other zero vectors <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> result from states zero and seven. The zero vectors result in all output voltages of inverter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> being zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Vector <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is an example of a reference voltage. A coincident vector of the actual voltages <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> may be synthesized as a time average of a zero vector and vectors <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> that frame vector <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, a method of determining the switching pattern from the reference voltage is Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM). SVPWM is executed in the following manner. Compliance with the reference voltage represented by vector <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is achieved by setting switches in inverter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to the state represented by vector <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>, the state represented by vector <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the zero state represented by vector <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>, each for a specific fraction of a switching cycle. The specific fraction of each state is calculated by using simple formulas involving the magnitude &verbar;v&verbar; of the vector <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and the angle &agr; of vector <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, represented by arrow <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. One skilled in the art will recognize that other methods for determining the switching pattern for PWM that may be used to determine the switching pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, RPWM is provided having sampling cycles having periods of a constant length and switching cycles having periods of random length. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a time diagram of sampling cycle periods compared to sampling cycles periods. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the periods of sampling cycles <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> are all of the length, Tsample. The period of sampling cycles all vary. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, switching periods <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> have periods that are greater than sampling period, Tsample. Switching periods <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> are shown to have periods that are less then sampling period Tsample. Tsample must be sufficiently long enough to calculate the switching pattern within the same cycle as the reference voltage produced. This allows the switching pattern to be determined for a switching cycle before the cycle begins. Switching periods <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> are equal to sampling period Tsample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, each switching period <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> has a coincident sampling period <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. The start of each switching period <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> is delayed from the starting time of the period of the coincident sampling period. The switching signals that are applied during a switching period <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> are produced from a reference voltage generated in the sampling cycle <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> immediately prior to the coincident sampling cycle <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> of the switching period <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>. For example, the switching signals applied in switching cycle <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> are generated from the reference voltage determined from signals received in sampling cycle <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. In accordance with this invention, each period of a sampling cycle must be of at least a minimal length to allow the switching pattern to be applied. One skilled in the art will recognize that the exact determination of the required length of the period will depend on factors, including but not limited to processing speed of the processor, amount of computations needed, and delay time of the switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a flow diagram of steps executed by a processing system to provide RPWM in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of this invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that although shown in a particular order, the ordering of steps may be changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Process <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> begins in step <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> by determining a switching period randomly for the next switching cycle. The switching period may be randomly determined in any way that varies the length of the switching period. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> described below is an exemplary embodiment of a process for randomly determining the switching period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, process <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> determines the start time of the switching cycle. Typically, the start time is relative to the starting time of coincident sampling cycle. In a preferred embodiment, the start time is determined by adding a first calculated delay to the start time of a sampling cycle coincident to the switching cycle. Preferably, any switching cycle does not start before the start time of a coincident sampling cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>, process <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> determines the switching pattern for the switching cycle. As stated above, Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) or other PWM techniques may be used to determine the switching pattern. After the switching pattern is determined, process <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> generates the switching signals to apply to switches in the power converter in step <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. The switching signals are then applied to the switches in step <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>. Process <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> then determines whether another switching cycle is needed in step <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. If another switching cycle is needed, process <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is repeated from step <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, process <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As stated above, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a process <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> for determining a switching period. One skilled in the art will recognize that there are many other alternatives for determining the switching period. Some examples may include but are not limited to generating a random length or progressively changing the length in a repetitive pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Process <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> begins in step <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> for determining whether this is a first iteration of process <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. The determination may be completed by reading the memory storing a first delay to determine whether data is stored in the memory. If it is determined that this is a first iteration, process <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> generates a first random number in step <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. In this exemplary embodiment, the first random number is a number between 0 and 1. The first random number typically includes only one or two significant digits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>, process <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> calculates a first delay by multiplying the first random number by the period of the sampling cycle. For example, the first random number is 0.25 and the period of the sampling cycle is Tsample. Therefore, the first delay is 0.25*Tsample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> After step <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> or a determination that this is not a first iteration, process <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> generates a second random number. As stated above for the first random number, the second random number is a number between zero and one, preferably having one or two significant digits. In step <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>, process <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> determines a second delay by multiplying the second random number by the period of the sampling cycle. In this exemplary embodiment, the second delay is the delay for a switching cycle subsequent to the switching cycle for which the period is being determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight>, the period for the switching cycle is calculated. In this exemplary embodiment, each switching cycle is delayed from the start time of a coincident sampling cycle. Therefore, the period of the switching cycle is the amount of time remaining in the sampling cycle after the delay and the amount of delay for the next switching period from the coincident sampling cycle of the next switching cycle. Therefore, the following equation is used to determine the period of the switching cycle: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Tswitching&equals;(Tsample&minus;Tdelay<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)&plus;Tdelay <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Where: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Tswitching&equals;period of the switching cycle; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Tsample&equals;period of the sampling cycle; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Tdelay<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;amount of first delay; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Tdelay<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;amount of second delay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> After the period of the switching cycle is determined, the period of the switching cycle is compared to a switching period minimum in step <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight>. The switching period minimum is the minimal amount of time in switching cycle needed to apply switching signals to the switches. One skilled in the art will recognize that the switching period minimum may be determined by various parameters including, but not limited to processor speed, signal propagation time, and switching speed. If the switching period is less than the switching period minimum, the switching period is set to the switching period minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When the switching period is set to the switching period minimum, the second delay must be changed to reflect the change in the start time of the next switching cycle. In step <highlight><bold>845</bold></highlight>, the second delay is calculated for the changed switching period. In the exemplary embodiment, the second delay is calculated by the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Tdelay<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;Tswitching&minus;(Tsample&minus;Tdelay<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Tdelay<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;Tswitching&minus;Tsample&plus;Tdelay<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> After the second delay is calculated or a determination that the switching period is greater than or equal to the switching period minimum, the second delay is stored as a first delay for the subsequent switching cycle in step <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> and process <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the switching cycles may be grouped into groups of N switching cycles. In this case, a counter Y is maintained and incremented at the start of each iteration of process <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. A comparison is then made of the counter, Y, to the number N before each iteration. If Y&equals;N, the period of the switching cycle is calculated by subtracting the first delay from the period of the sampling cycle according to the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Tswitching&equals;Tsample&minus;Tdelay<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> After the switching period is determined process <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> ends and returns to process <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> While embodiments and applications of this invention have been shown and described, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art that many more modifications than mentioned above are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein. The invention, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims. </paragraph>
