<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a mobile communication terminal including two housings connected to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a mobile communication terminal of this type, first and second housings are connected such that they can be set in the first state wherein they are open or in the second state wherein they are folded. A microphone is arranged in the first housing, and a receiver is arranged in the second housing. For this reason, the microphone and receiver are sometimes closer to each other in the second state than in the first state depending on the positions of the microphone and receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In this case, if a mobile communication terminal in use is set in the second state, the voice output from the receiver is directly input to the microphone, resulting in howling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a conventional mobile communication terminal, when it is set in the second state during use, both the microphone and the receiver are set in a mute mode. Alternatively, voice communication itself is ended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For this reason, even when the user wants to only listen to received voice, the mobile communication terminal must be kept set in the first state. This is inconvenient. The user wants to only listen to received voice, for example, when he uses an information distribution service such as a weather forecast service by voice or he listens to downloaded music during download. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the mobile communication terminal of the embodiment includes an antenna <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, radio section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, PCM processing section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, speaker amplifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, transmitter amplifier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, input section <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, display section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, storage section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, timing circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, first detector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, second detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, third detector <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The radio section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a duplexer (DUP) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>receiving circuit (RX) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>frequency synthesizer (SYN) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and transmitting circuit (TX) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A radio signal transmitted from a base station (not shown) is received by the antenna <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and input to the radio section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the radio section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the radio signal is input to the receiving circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through the duplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The radio signal is mixed, by the receiving circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>with a reception local oscillation signal output from the frequency synthesizer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Thus, the radio signal is frequency-converted into an intermediate frequency signal. The frequency of the reception local oscillation signal generated by the frequency synthesizer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is set by a control signal output from the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The intermediate frequency signal is input to the CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> despreads the intermediate frequency signal using a spreading code assigned to the reception channel. The CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> executes quadrature demodulation corresponding to, e.g., QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), thereby obtaining demodulated data having a predetermined format corresponding to the data rate. The CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> supplies the demodulated data to the compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> For the demodulated data output from the CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> executes expansion processing corresponding to the received data rate supplied from the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also executes decoding processing using Viterbi decoding and error correcting decoding processing to reconstruct baseband voice data or packet data. The compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> supplies voice data to the PCM processing section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or the packet data to the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The PCM processing section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> PCM-decodes the digital voice data output from the compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to obtain an analog voice signal. The voice signal is amplified by the receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and output from the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as voice. Alternatively, the voice signal is amplified by the speaker amplifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and output from the speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as loud voice. The operations of the receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and speaker amplifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are individually turned on/off under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The voice of the speaking person is converted into a voice signal by the microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This voice signal is input to the transmitter amplifier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is set in a state wherein the microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the input of the transmitter amplifier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or in a state wherein the input of the transmitter amplifier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is grounded under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The voice signal is amplified to an appropriate level by the transmitter amplifier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and supplied to the PCM processing section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The PCM processing section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> executes PCM encoding processing for the voice signal to obtain digital voice data. The PCM processing section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> supplies the voice data to the compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Packet data generated by the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is supplied from the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> detects the energy of the voice data and determines a data rate on the basis of the detection result. The compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> compresses the voice data into a signal having a format corresponding to the data rate. The compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also executes error correcting coding processing by, e.g., convolutional encoding for the voice data and supplies it to the CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In transmitting packet data, the compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> executes error correcting coding processing for the packet data output from the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and outputs the data to the CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> modulates the carrier wave signal by the transmission data supplied from the compression/expansion section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. For example, QPSK is used for this modulation. The CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> executes spread spectrum processing for the modulated carrier wave signal using a PN code assigned to each transmission channel, thereby obtaining a transmission signal. The CDMA processing section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> supplies the transmission signal to the transmitting circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the radio section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The transmitting circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>combines the transmission signal with a transmission local oscillation signal generated by the frequency synthesizer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>thereby converting the transmission signal into a radio frequency signal. The transmitting circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>RF-amplifies only the effective portion of the radio frequency signal on the basis of a transmission data rate supplied from the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and outputs the radio frequency signal. The radio frequency signal output from the transmitting circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is supplied to the antenna <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the duplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and transmitted from the antenna <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a base station (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The input section <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes keys including a dial key, calling key, power key, and end key. The input section <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> inputs a user instruction by pressing these keys. The display section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), LED (Light Emitting Diode), and the like. The display section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> displays, by the LCD and LED, information to be supplied to the user under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The storage section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed by appropriately using, e.g. a ROM, DRAM (Dynamic RAM), and SRAM (Static RAM). The storage section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> stores an operation program for the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The storage section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> also stores various kinds of setting information, various kinds of received data, and various kinds of data generated in the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The timing circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates a reference clock at a predetermined rate. The timing circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> supplies the reference clock to circuit portions represented by the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the terminal, which require an operation clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The first detector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> detects whether the housings are folded.

However, if YES in step ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives, in step ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a user&apos;s designation whether switching of the voice output form is to be turned on or off. In step ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> registers the ON/OFF designation content as &ldquo;voice output setting&rdquo; and ends the menu operation reception processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Upon talking, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> executes voice communication state setting processing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> at a predetermined timing, e.g., at a predetermined interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> confirms whether communication which is being executed is communication with voice output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> If data such as email or image data without any voice output is being downloaded, i.e., NO in step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> confirms in step ST<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> whether a non-voice communication state (to be described later) is already set. If NO in step ST<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> sets the non-voice communication state in step ST<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and ends the voice communication state setting processing. If YES in step ST<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> ends the voice communication state setting processing without any processing, i.e., while maintaining the non-voice communication state. In this way, the non-voice communication state is set when communication without any voice output is being executed. In the non-voice communication state, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> powers off both the receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and speaker amplifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to stop outputting voice. In addition, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> changes the switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the ground side to set a mute mode for transmission voice. Hence, in this state, the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are invalid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When YES in step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> confirms in step ST<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the basis of the detection result from the second detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> whether an earphone is attached. If YES in step ST<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> confirms in step ST<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> whether an earphone voice communication state (to be described later) is already set. If NO in step ST<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> sets the earphone voice communication state in step ST<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and ends the voice communication state setting processing. If YES in step ST<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> ends the voice communication state setting processing without any processing, i.e., while maintaining the earphone voice communication state. In this manner, when communication with voice output is being executed, and an earphone is attached, the earphone voice communication state is set. In the earphone voice communication state, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> powers off both the receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the speaker amplifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to make the earphone output voice. Hence, in this state, the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are invalid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> If NO in step ST<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> confirms in step ST<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the basis of the detection result from the third detector <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> whether a hands-free device is attached. If YES in step ST<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> confirms in step ST<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> whether a hands-free voice communication state (to be described later) is already set. If NO in step ST<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> sets the hands-free voice communication state in step ST<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and ends the voice communication state setting processing. If YES in step ST<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> ends the voice communication state setting processing without any processing, i.e., while maintaining the hands-free voice communication state. In this manner, when communication with voice output is being executed, and a hands-free device is attached, the hands-free voice communication state is set. In the hands-free voice communication state, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> powers off both the receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the speaker amplifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and changes the switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the ground side to make the hands-free device input/output voice. Hence, in this state, the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are invalid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As described above, when any one of the non-voice communication state, earphone voice communication state, and hands-free voice communication state is set, it is not confirmed whether the folded state is set. Either in the open state or in the folded state, the set state is maintained. In the non-voice communication state, earphone voice communication state, and hands-free voice communication state, the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is invalid. When the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is invalidated in advance, the voice communication state is not changed independently of whether the folded state is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> If NO in step ST<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> confirms in step ST<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the basis of the detection result from the first detector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> whether the folded state is set. If NO in step ST<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> confirms in step ST<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> whether a main body voice communication state (to be described later) is already set. If NO in step ST<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> sets the main body voice communication state in step ST<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and ends the voice communication state setting processing. If YES in step ST<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> ends the voice communication state setting processing without any processing, i.e., while maintaining the main body voice communication state. In this way, when communication with voice output is being executed, neither an earphone nor a hands-free device is attached, and the folded state is not set, the main body voice communication state is set. In the main body voice communication state, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> powers on the receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, powers off the speaker amplifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and changes the switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> side. Hence, in this state, the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are valid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As described above, assume a state wherein the terminal is in use, and the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are valid. When the lower housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and upper housing <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are folded in this state, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> immediately confirms the folded state in step ST<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this case, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> confirms in step ST<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> whether &ldquo;voice output setting&rdquo; is ON. If YES in step ST<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> changes the switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the ground side to set the mute mode for transmission voice in step ST<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In step ST<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> powers off the receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, powers on the speaker amplifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and ends the voice communication state setting processing. That is, as far as &ldquo;voice output setting&rdquo; is set ON, even when communication is in progress, and the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are valid, they are forcibly invalidated upon confirming the folded state. The output of received voice is switched to the speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. If NO in step ST<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> ends the voice communication state setting processing without any processing, i.e., while maintaining the voice communication state set until that time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to this embodiment, in a voice communication state using the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, when the lower housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and upper housing <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are folded, driving the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by the receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is stopped, and outgoing voice is set in the mute mode by the switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby forcibly invalidating the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For this reason, even when the lower housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and upper housing <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are folded to make the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> oppose each other, no howling occurs. Received voice is output from the speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> exposed on the outside in the folded state. As a result, the user can listen to received voice while keeping the mobile communication terminal folded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, when the mobile communication terminal is folded in use, loud voice output from the speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is forcibly started. Even when the user erroneously has folded the mobile communication terminal during voice communication, loud voice is output from the speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In this case, people around the user may listen to the received voice against user&apos;s will. In this embodiment, however, the above-described forcible start of loud voice output from the speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be inhibited by turning off &ldquo;voice output setting&rdquo;. Hence, if the user does not want people around him to listen to received voice, erroneous loud voice output of received voice can be reliably prevented by turning off &ldquo;voice output setting&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the above embodiment. For example, if the level of a roundabout sound component, which is output from the speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and input to the microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, can be suppressed relatively low, the microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> need not always be forcibly invalidated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Voice output setting&rdquo; may be omitted. Instead, when a predetermined condition is satisfied, the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may always be forcibly invalidated, and loud voice output of received voice from the speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may always be done. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For example, only in a communication state wherein only reception of a forward link signal is done, as in a data downloading state, the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be forcibly invalidated, and loud voice output of received voice from the speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be done. With this arrangement, erroneous loud voice output of received voice of voice communication can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is invalidated when communication without any voice output is being executed, an earphone is attached, or a hands-free device is attached. However, the mobile communication terminal need not always cope with all these states or may cope with another state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> To invalidate the microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, any other technique of, e.g., only disconnecting the microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the transmitter amplifier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, powering off the transmitter amplifier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or reducing the gain of the transmitter amplifier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> To invalidate the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, any other technique of, e.g., grounding the input of the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, disconnecting the receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, or reducing the gain of the receiver amplifier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The speaker <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be arranged on the outer surface of the lower housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the folded state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are so arranged that they oppose each other in the folded state. However, the present invention can also be applied to an arrangement in which the receiver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and microphone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are shifted from each other in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, the mobile communication terminal of the present invention is applied to the CDMA scheme. However, an arbitrary communication scheme can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The lower and upper housings <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may have any other connection; they may be slid open or closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
