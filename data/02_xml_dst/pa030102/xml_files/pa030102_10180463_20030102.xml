<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a semiconductor device and its manufacturing method, and more particularly to a semiconductor device having device isolation by STI and its manufacturing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of downsizing semiconductor devices, the method of isolating devices by STI (Shallow Trench Isolation) has been used for years in lieu of the technique using selective oxidation for isolating devices. STI is a technique for electrically insulating device regions forming devices from other regions in a semiconductor device by making trenches. In STI, trenches are formed in device isolating regions instead of selective oxidation thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> having conventional STI under a process of its manufacturing. A gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed on the top surface of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in form of an amorphous silicon film overlies the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is deposited on the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is deposited on the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are selectively removed by etching into a predetermined pattern by photolithography. After that, using the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as a mask, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are selectively removed by etching. In this etching, the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed to dig into the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the side and bottom surface portions of the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are oxidized by RTO (rapid thermal oxidation) in an oxygen O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere held at 1000&deg; C. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the surrounding structure after RTO treatment are shown in an enlarged scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> On the side surface and the bottom surface of the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is formed by RTO. The silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> protects the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In general, the diffusion coefficient of an oxidation seed is smaller when diffusing into silicon single crystal used as a semiconductor substrate exhibit than when diffusion into amorphous silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the oxidation process by RTO, thickness T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed on silicon single crystal used as the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thinner than the thickness T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Either in silicon single crystal or amorphous silicon, end portions like sides or corners located at boundaries of two planes receive a larger stress than flat surface portions as the oxidation progresses. To such end portions of silicon single crystal or amorphous silicon, the oxide seed is difficult to diffuse. Therefore, there occurs the phenomenon in which planar surfaces of silicon single crystal or amorphous silicon are more easily oxidized whereas end portions of that are difficult to oxidize. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of an end portion of a semiconductor substrate and an end portion of a gate electrode that are encircled by a broken line circle in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Since the end portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the end portion of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are more difficult to oxidize than flat surfaces, the oxide film formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> become thinner and thinner toward their end portions than the thickness on their flat surfaces. As a result, the end portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the end portion of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are sharpened (see the inside of the broken line circle of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). The shaper the end portions of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the larger the stress applied thereto. Thus the electric field is liable to concentrate at the end portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is thinner than the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the end portion of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> overlaps a flat portion of the substrate top surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when viewed from a vertical direction relative to the substrate top surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see the dot-and-dash line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As the stress to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> becomes larger, electrons trapped in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> increase (hereinafter called trapped electrons). The increase of the trapped electrons causes fluctuation of the threshold voltage (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Fluctuation of the threshold voltage prevents normal operation of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. In case the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is used as the floating gate electrode of a memory, those defects often decreases the possible frequency of write and erase operation (hereinafter called W/E endurance characteristics) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when viewed from a direction vertical to the substrate top surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, since the end portion of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> liable to gather the electric field overlaps a flat portion of the substrate top surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the resistance voltage of the gate in the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> undesirably decreases. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the invention will be explained below with reference to the drawings. The embodiment, however, should not be construed to limit the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C are enlarged cross-sectional views of a trench and its surrounding structure in a semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having STI according to an embodiment of the invention. The semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is manufactured in the order of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> First referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, formed on the top surface of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in form of a silicon oxide film, approximately 10 nm thick, for example. Formed on the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in form of an amorphous silicon film, approximately 60 nm thick, for example. Deposited on the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Deposited on the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are selectively etched into a predetermined pattern by using photolithography. After that, using the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as a mask, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are selectively removed by etching. In this etching, a trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed to pass through the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and reach to the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the side and bottom surface portions of the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are oxidized by RTO in an atmosphere containing hydrogen H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and oxygen O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>held at approximately 1000&deg; C. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and its surrounding structure after oxidation in the hydrogen H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and oxygen O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere in an enlarged cross-sectional view. Thickness T<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of the oxide film formed along the side surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and thickness T<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the oxide film formed along the side surface of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are substantially equal. In case of this embodiment, thickness T<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and thickness T<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>were approximately 6 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> After that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C, a</cross-reference> silicon oxide material <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is deposited to bury the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by using the HDP (high density plasma) technique. Then the silicon oxide material <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is smoothed by CMP, and the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thereafter heated in a nitrogen atmosphere held at approximately 900&deg; C. After the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is next exposed to NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>F solution, the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is removed by phosphation at approximately 150&deg; C.

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the embodiment is electrically insulated from the semiconductor substrate, and includes the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having an opposed surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> facing to the substrate surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> penetrating the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and extending into the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed between the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to electrically insulate them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made of, for example, silicon single crystal. The gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a silicon oxide film formed by oxidizing the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed by depositing amorphous silicon, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed on the substrate side surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by RTO, and a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed on the gate side surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, thickness T<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and thickness T<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are approximately equal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In case the oxidation of the side surface and the bottom surface of the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is carried out in an oxygen O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(dry oxygen) atmosphere as the conventional technique did, the diffusion coefficient of the oxidation seed is relatively small. Especially, the oxidation seed exhibits a smaller diffusion coefficient when diffusing into silicon single crystal than when diffusing into amorphous silicon. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, thickness T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>becomes thinner than thickness T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the invention, oxidation of the side surface and the bottom surface of the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is carried out in a hydrogen H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plus oxygen O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere. In this case, the oxidation seed exhibits a larger diffusion coefficient than conventional one. The increase of the diffusion coefficient for diffusion into silicon single crystal is especially great as compared with the increase of the diffusion coefficient for diffusion into amorphous silicon. Therefore, the difference in oxidation speed between silicon single crystal and amorphous silicon is diminished, and it results in substantially equalizing the thickness T<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the thickness T<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the instant embodiment, oxygen radicals are generated by inviting interaction of hydrogen H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and oxygen O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>by RTO under a high temperature, and the oxygen radicals serve as the oxidation seed. However, also when using O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(ozone) in lieu of hydrogen H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and oxygen O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>for oxidation, the same configuration as the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the instant embodiment can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, since the diffusion coefficient of the oxidation seed becomes relatively larger, oxidation is promoted at the end portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the end portion of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that are subjected to a stress. Therefore, in the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the instant embodiment, the end portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the end portion of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are not sharp or beveled unlike those of the conventional device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the instant embodiment, the boundary end portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> defined between the substrate side surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> forming a part of the side surface of the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the substrate top surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the boundary end portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> defined between the gate side surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> forming a part of the trench <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the opposed surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, are rounded into a spherical form having a curvature radius not smaller than 30 angstrom. In case of the conventional semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, since the boundary end portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the boundary end portion of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are not clearly defined, they were named here the end portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the end portion of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the instant embodiment, the boundary end portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the boundary end portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> substantially correspond to the end portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the end portion of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Once the boundary end portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are shaped spherical with a curvature radius not smaller than a certain value, concentration of the stress to the boundary end portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be alleviated. Simultaneously, local concentration of the electric field to the boundary end portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is alleviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the instant embodiment, since the thickness T<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the thickness T<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are approximately equal, the substrate top surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the boundary end portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> do not overlap, and the opposed surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the boundary end portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> do not overlap, when they are viewed from a direction vertical to the substrate top surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In other words, in a view from a direction vertical to the substrate top surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the boundary end portions <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> appear to overlap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Because of this configuration, even if the electric field concentrates to the boundary end portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is unlikely to break, and this feature contributes to improving the production yield of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a graph that illustrates a relation between the curvature radius of boundary end portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the variation of trapped electrons (&Dgr;Vge). &Dgr;Vge is the variation of the gate voltage for representation of the variation of the electrons trapped in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This graph shows in actual measurement value the variation of the trapped electrons after applying a constant current stress of 0.1A/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>from the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for 20 seconds and injecting electric charges of approximately 2 C/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> When the boundary end portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> have a curvature radius smaller than approximately 30 angstrom, &Dgr;Vge is large, and the amount of the trapped electrons is great. When the curvature radius of the boundary end portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is larger than approximately 30 angstrom, &Dgr;Vge is small, and the amount of the trapped electrons is small. When the curvature radius exceeds approximately 30 angstrom, the rate of the decrease of &Dgr;Vge decelerates. Therefore, when the curvature radius of the boundary end portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are adjusted to be approximately 30 angstrom or more, concentration of the stress and the electric field to the boundary end portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is effectively alleviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a graph that illustrates a relation between the stress in a gate insulating film and the amount of the trapped electrons. The abscissa of the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> represents the stress in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> whereas the ordinate represents the variation of the trapped electrons (&Dgr;Vge). This graph shows in simulation value the variation of the trapped electrons in each of the conventional semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the instant embodiment after applying a constant current stress of 0.1 A/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>from the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for 20 seconds, and injecting electric charges of approximately 2 C/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, as the stress in the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> decreases, the value &Dgr;Vge decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As the difference in thickness between the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>increases, the stress of the gate insulting film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> increases. Further, as the stress to the boundary end portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> increases, the stress in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> increases. It can therefore be understood that the amount of the trapped electrons in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the instant embodiment is less than the amount of the trapped electrons in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the conventional semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> &Dgr;Vge is different in value and sign between <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This is because <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows &Dgr;Vge in experimental value and absolute value but <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows it in simulation value with the plus or minus sign. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a graph that illustrates a typical relation between the duration of time of the supply of a constant current to the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the variation of the trapped electrons in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (&Dgr;Vge). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> teaches that the amount of the trapped electrons increases as the duration of time of the supply of a constant current to the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> becomes longer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a graph that illustrates a typical relation between the threshold voltage (Vt) of the semiconductor device and the variation of the trapped electrons (&Dgr;Vge) in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> teaches that the threshold voltage of the semiconductor device changes in proportion to the amount of the trapped electrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As compared with the conventional semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the instant embodiment is less in the amount of electrons (&Dgr;Vge) trapped in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>), and therefore smaller in fluctuation of the threshold voltage (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). This means that the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is stronger against electrical stress and has a longer lifetime than the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a graph that illustrates a typical relation between the W/E endurance characteristics in a memory of the semiconductor device and the threshold voltage of the semiconductor device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> teaches that, as the Write/Erase frequency increases, the amount of electrons trapped in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> increases, and the threshold voltage of the semiconductor device results in fluctuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</cross-reference>, it is understood that the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the instant embodiment exhibits a smaller variation of the trapped electrons (&Dgr;Vge) relative to the constant current stress than that of the conventional semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in a nonvolatile semiconductor storage device using the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as its floating gate electrode, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the instant embodiment will operate with a smaller variation of the trapped electrons (&Dgr;Vge) and smaller fluctuation of the threshold voltage even over more frequent Write/Erase actions than the conventional semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, even if operated for Write/Erase more frequently, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can hold electric charges in the gate electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as the floating gate electrode for a longer period of time than the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Although the explanation with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 7</cross-reference> has been made in conjunction with the trapped electrons, it is similarly applicable also to the trapped holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor device according to the instant embodiment as explained above ensures that since the stress and the electric field do not concentrate at end portions of the semiconductor substrate and the amorphous silicon film, the trapped electrons are fewer and the resistance to voltage of the gate is relatively higher than the conventional semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing method of a semiconductor device according to an embodiment the invention can manufacture a semiconductor device in which since a stress and an electric field do not concentrate at the end portions of the semiconductor substrate and the amorphous silicon film, the trapped electrons are fewer and the resistance to voltage of the gate is relatively higher than the conventional method. </paragraph>
