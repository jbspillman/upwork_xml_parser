<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Doctors and other medical professionals often use powered surgical instruments for dissecting bone and tissue. Often, it is important to lubricate the instruments for proper use. For example, a typical pneumatically powered surgical instrument includes a pneumatic motor connected to a fluid supply source. An oil system is typically place inline between the fluid supply source and the pneumatic motor to provide lubrication to the instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The oil system often must be manually calibrated and/or activated according to predetermined guidelines. For example, the oil system is typically set at a specified drip rate for providing oil into the fluid path. Maintaining the proper drip rate is important to providing the proper amount of lubrication to the instrument. Numerous drawbacks inherently exist in such a system. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With initial reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, an inline oiler cartridge assembly for a pneumatically powered surgical instrument according to the teachings of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated and generally identified at reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In one particular application, the inline oiler cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is used with a pneumatically powered surgical instrument <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A suitable surgical instrument is shown in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,505,737 which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. However, it will become apparent below that the teachings of the present invention have applicability for various other powered instruments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> and additional reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>F, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B, the inline oiler cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention will be further described. As perhaps most clearly shown in the exploded view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the inline oiler cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown to generally include a body or housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having an upper portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a lower portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The inline oiler cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is further shown to generally include a first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for delivering a source of pressurized air to the pneumatically powered instrument <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a second conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for returning exhaust gases from the pneumatically powered instrument <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Although the first and second conduits <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are coaxial in the present description, it is understood that in other embodiments, these conduits may be separate (not coaxial), or one of the conduits may not be used at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>F, the lower portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is illustrated to have a generally cylindrical shape. In one application, the lower portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is injection molded of plastic. Alternatively other suitable materials may be incorporated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The lower portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an outer cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a concentrically arranged inner cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a bottom wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A first generally cylindrical cavity <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> or chamber is defined between the inner and outer cylindrical walls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A second generally cylindrical cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is defined by the inner cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, an oil saturated cellulose fiber material <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed in the second cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Also, a dry cellulose fiber material <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is disposed within the first generally cylindrical cavity or lubricant chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. It is understood that cellulose fiber materials <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are merely examples of absorbent materials, and other examples include foam, wool felt, porous plastics, porous metals and/or other type materials. In a manner to be further addressed below, oil is drawn from the second cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for introduction into an air stream. Exhaust gases including spent oil are returned to the first cavity <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The dry cellulose fiber material <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> filters the oil from the exhaust gases. The filtered exhaust gases are permitted to pass through a plurality of exhaust apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provided in the bottom wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the lower portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> With particularly reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D, the upper portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be further described. Similar to the lower portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the upper portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably unitarily constructed of plastic through an injection molding procedure. Again, alternate materials and manners of construction can alternatively be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The upper portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a generally cylindrical segment <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is internally threaded. The internal threads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> engage external threads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) provided on an upper area of the outer cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the lower portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such that the upper and lower portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be removably secured. An upper segment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the upper portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> defines a channel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> downwardly extends from the upper segment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and into the cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes one or more apertures <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A-C for providing fluid communication between the channel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and securing the conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It is understood that there may be several different configurations and sizes of apertures to achieve different results, depending upon the lubrication requirements of the surgical instrument <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment, the smallest aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A allows inward air pressure to feed into the lubricant chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> thereby pressurizing the lubricant chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The middle aperture or central aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B projects into the lubricant soaked media of the second cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and allows lubricant to exit into the air flow passing through the conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The middle aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B has a larger diameter in order to effect a pressure differential (drop) between the conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and lubricant chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> thereby creating a Venturi or &ldquo;sucking&rdquo; action and drawing lubricant into the air flow passing through the conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for delivery to the pneumatic motor. As shown in the exploded view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an oiler tube <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extends from the central aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B down into the cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The largest aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>C is a hole through which a mechanical securing device (not specifically shown) is positioned for affixing the first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the lubricant chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, as discussed in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As particularly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, suitable O-rings or gaskets may be employed. Explained further, a first O-ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides a seal between the upper portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the lower portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A second O-ring <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> provides a seal between the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> With particularly reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, the first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the inline oiler cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is further illustrated. The first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a hollow tubular member injection molded of plastic or constructed of other suitable materials. The first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> defines a central channel <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. A first end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is intended to be coupled to an air source (now shown). The first end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> also is positioned inside of the channel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference>). A second end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is reduced in diameter and is adapted to be coupled to the pneumatically powered instrument <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through a hose <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference>). The first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes radially extending apertures <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A-C that align with the apertures <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A-C, respectively, of the upper portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The mechanical securing device (not shown), such as a set screw, engages with the apertures <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>C to secure the first conduit inside the upper segment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As particular shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the second conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a hollow tubular member. The second conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is received within the cylindrical segment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the upper portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and cooperates with the upper portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to define a fluid path for returning exhaust gases from the pneumatically powered instrument to the outer cylindrical cavity <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the lower portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The second conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> concentrically surrounds the second end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In operation, pressurized air is introduced into the first end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In one particular application, the air is introduced at a pressure of approximately 120 psi. Further, an on/off control mechanism, such as a foot pedal, may be disposed between a compressed air source and the instrument <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, such as at the first end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The pressurized air passes through the channel <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> defined by the first conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and through a Venturi effect draws oil from the wet fiber cellulose material <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the air stream. This oil is atomized and delivered with the air stream into the motor of the pneumatically powered instrument for lubrication. On one application, the atomized oil lubricates the motor within approximately 45-50 seconds of startup. This compares with conventional arrangements which take approximately 150 to 300 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Exhaust gases carrying spent oil from the motor of the pneumatically powered instrument are returned through the second conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. These exhaust gases are introduced into the outer cylindrical chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> containing the dry fiber cellulose material through a pathway <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference>) defined in the upper portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The dry fiber cellulose material within the cavity <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> filters the spent oil from the exhaust gases and allows the exhaust gases to pass through the plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the bottom wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred method of the present invention, the inline oiler cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above is pre-filled with oil. The amount of oil is sufficient to ensure lubrication of the motor of the pneumatically powered instrument throughout a surgical procedure. Explaining further, the risk of running out of oil during a surgical procedure is effectively eliminated. After the surgically procedure is completed, the inline oiler cartridge assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be disconnected from the surgical instrument and discarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>. Lubrication assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes many of the same components of the previously described embodiments and is intended for operation in the same environment set forth above. Lubrication assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> having apertures for receiving inlet air tube <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and outlet air tube <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Preferably, body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is formed from aluminum. It will be understood that inlet air tube <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is connected to a source of pressurized fluid. Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> coaxial hose may be connected to the lubrication housing <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with a high pressure hose fitted over flanges <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the lower pressure exhaust hose received with aperture <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> further defines a cylindrical shell <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> having an opening at one end to receive a lubrication fluid reservoir and exhaust filter unit as previously described above. Shell <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> includes a pair of locking slots <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> adapted to receive projections on the exterior of the lubrication and filter unit to retain it within the body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Preferably, internal grooves <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> extend from the aperture opening to the grooves <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> such that the projections may be advanced into the interior of the body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the helical path of grooves <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> will tend to advance the lubrication and filter unit into the body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Grooves <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> includes substantially flat portions at their termination such that the lubrication and filter body will be locked into position in the body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and permitting the seals to sealingly engage the lubrication and filter unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Lubrication assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> further includes fluid passageways adapted to create fluid flow through the lubrication material (not shown). Specifically, inlet channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> having a first diameter is in fluid communication with the pressurized fluid from inlet tube <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A reduced diameter portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> provides a conduit between inlet channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and outlet channel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> within outlet tube <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Within the wall defining inlet channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, an aperture communicates with inlet fluid path <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Similarly, within the wall defining reduced diameter portion, an aperture communicates with outlet fluid path <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. A further component of the fluid pathway is extension <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> joined to the body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> substantially centered within cylindrical shell <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The extension <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> defines an inlet fluid path <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> in communication with inlet fluid path <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and an outlet fluid path <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> in communication with outlet fluid path <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that the extension <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> generates a longer fluid path through the lubrication material to enhance the uniform nature of atomizing lubricant in the return air stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> While it is contemplated that the combination of aperture sizes, fluid passage diameters and lengths may be sized to approximate the desired airflow through the lubricating material, the present embodiment incorporates a flow control mechanism such that air flow may be controlled through the lubricating assembly. Specifically, a needle valve body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is received in aperture <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> in the body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The needle valve body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes a needle valve portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> extending into conical valve seat <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to restrict fluid flow. The needle valve body <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> also includes an instrument engaging recess <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> to move it within aperture <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> via the threaded connection <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> operates in a manner similar to that of the embodiment previously described. By way of example, pressurized fluid entering inlet channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> encounters reduced diameter portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, thus restricting flow. As shown by the arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, pressurized fluid may enter inlet fluid path <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and travel through inlet fluid path <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to exit extension <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> into the lubricant-soaked absorbent material (not shown). As previously described, the absorbent material may be impregnated with oil or some other lubricant. The pressurized fluid tends to seek a path to escape from the lubricant material. As a result of the venturi effect adjacent the aperture in reduced diameter portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, outlet fluid path <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> experiences a lower pressure and the higher pressure fluid may flow into the outlet through outlet path <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and ultimately into reduced diameter portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. As the fluid passes through the lubricant material it picks up small particles or drops of lubricant and carries these elements in the fluid stream. The lubricating material may then be carried by the fluid to the motor where it performs its lubricating function. It will be understood that the needle valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> may be adjusted to control fluid flow through the lubricating material and thereby control lubricant to the motor. In a preferred embodiment, the needle valve is set in the manufacturing process to provide lubrication within the required specifications prior to packaging and shipping to the end user. It is anticipated that further adjustments will not be necessary for the end user. However, it is contemplated that if changes are made to the lubricating material or the pressure of the inlet fluid, modifications of the needle valve setting may be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
