<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a video signal processing technique, and more particularly, it relates to a technique for displaying a video signal on a display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently, video signals have been dealt with as digital signals. Also, signals to be input to video equipment have been diversified and there are a variety of signals such as video system signals, PC system signals and signals for game equipment. With respect to each of these various signals, there are a large number of formats. Therefore, display devices for displaying video signals, such as a CRT (cathode-ray tube), a liquid crystal display and a PDP (plasma display panel), are required to be applicable to a larger number of formats of the video signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Also, a display device is required to have a function to display one of the various formats of the video signals but to simultaneously display a multi-screen through synthesis of a plurality of video signals. Furthermore, it is indispensable to perform resize processing for matching the numbers of pixels arranged in the vertical and horizontal directions in one screen of the video signal with the numbers of pixels of a display device or of a desired screen size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to realize these functions, video signal processing circuits respectively corresponding to the formats of video signals to be input are conventionally designed, so as to construct a video signal processing system by combining these processing circuits. Accordingly, as the number of formats of processable video signals is increased, the circuit scale tends to increase. Furthermore, a large memory capacity is necessary for coping with a video signal format with a large screen size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is providing a video signal processing method and a video signal processing apparatus for performing processing in accordance with the format of an input video signal and the mode of a video signal to be obtained as an output, such as the number of screens to be simultaneously displayed and the screen size, so that a larger number of input video signal formats and output video signal modes can be dealt with without increasing the circuit scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The video signal processing method of this invention is employed in a video signal processing apparatus that includes a plurality of signal processing parts, each for executing signal processing, for processing two or more digitalized video signals in parallel, and the video signal processing method includes selecting one or more video signals from the two or more digitalized video signals; and obtaining an object video signal by selecting, from the plurality of signal processing parts, signal processing parts used for signal processing of the selected video signals in accordance with a mode of the object video signal and performing the signal processing in the selected signal processing parts in an order in accordance with the mode of the object video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing method, in the step of selecting one or more video signals, a plurality of video signals are preferably selected, and in the step of obtaining an object video signal, the object video signal is preferably obtained by synthesizing the selected plurality of video signals for displaying a synthesized screen of the plurality of video signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing method, in the step of obtaining an object video signal, the object video signal is preferably in synchronization with a synchronization signal of one of the selected video signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing method, in the step of obtaining an object video signal, the object video signal is preferably in synchronization with a synchronization signal different from a synchronization signal of any of the selected video signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing method, the step of obtaining an object video signal preferably includes a plurality of sub-steps in each of which signal processing is performed in one of the signal processing parts, and the plurality of sub-steps are preferably executed in an order in accordance with a format of a video signal to be processed in the signal processing parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, the signal processing in the signal processing parts are performed in an order in accordance with the format of the video signal, and hence, a larger number of formats of input video signals can be dealt with without increasing the circuit scale of the signal processing part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the plurality of sub-steps of the step of obtaining an object video signal include a sub-step of changing the format of the video signal to be processed and a sub-step of storing data of the video signal in a memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the plurality of sub-steps of the step of obtaining an object video signal include a sub-step of resizing a screen of the video signal and a sub-step of storing data of the video signal in a memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing method, the video signal processing apparatus preferably includes, as the plurality of signal processing parts, a signal processing part for performing signal processing on the basis of a fast clock having a higher frequency than a clock of the video signal input to the video signal processing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Thus, since the video signal having been written in the memory can be read out by using the fast clock, screen resize processing can be easily performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing method, the video signal processing apparatus preferably includes, as the plurality of signal processing parts, a signal processing part that performs signal processing without using the fast clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thus, the signal processing part performs the signal processing without using a clock with a high frequency, and hence, the power consumption can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the video signal processing method of this invention for synthesizing screens respectively corresponding to two or more digitalized video signals, includes the steps of time division multiplexing two or more video signals selected from a plurality of input video signals; and obtaining a synthesized video signal by synthesizing the selected video signals for displaying a synthesized screen, in which screens respectively corresponding to the selected video signals are synthesized, after performing signal processing on a time division multiplexed signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Thus, predetermined video signal processing are performed after the time division multiplexing of the necessary input video signals, and therefore, there is no need to provide an individual signal processing part for each input video signal, resulting in largely reducing the circuit scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The video signal processing apparatus of this invention that receives, as input video signals, a plurality of digitalized video signals and outputs an output video signal generated on the basis of video signal selected from the input video signals, includes an input signal selection unit for selecting, from the plurality of input video signals, one video signal as a main system video signal and another video signal as a sub system video signal and outputting the selected video signals; a main system signal processor for receiving the main system video signal, performing video signal processing by using a clock having a frequency higher than a clock frequency of the main system video signal and outputting a resultant video signal as an output thereof in synchronization with a synchronization signal of the output video signal; a sub system signal processor for receiving the sub system video signal, performing video signal processing by using a clock having a frequency higher than a clock frequency of the sub system video signal and outputting a resultant video signal as an output thereof in synchronization with the synchronization signal of the output video signal; a timing controller for receiving the synchronization signal of the output video signal and outputting an output select signal in synchronization with the synchronization signal of the output video signal; and a screen synthesis unit for receiving the outputs of the main system signal processor and the sub system signal processor and outputting the output video signal, in which screens are synthesized, through selection in accordance with the output select signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thus, the screen synthesis can be performed after the video signal processing of the video signals freely selected from the plurality of input video signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the video signal processing apparatus of this invention that receives, as input video signals, a plurality of digitalized video signals and outputs an output video signal generated on the basis of video signal selected from the input video signals, includes an input signal selection unit for selecting, from the plurality of input video signals, one video signal as a main system video signal and another video signal as a sub system video signal and outputting the selected video signals; a main system signal processor for receiving the main system video signal, performing video signal processing by using a clock having a frequency higher than a clock frequency of the main system video signal and outputting a resultant signal as an output thereof; a main system quality corrector for performing picture quality correction on the output of the main system signal processor and outputting a resultant video signal as an output thereof; a sub system signal processor for receiving the sub system video signal, performing video signal processing and outputting a resultant signal as an output thereof; a sub system quality corrector for performing picture quality correction on the output of the sub system signal processor and outputting a resultant video signal as an output thereof; a timing controller for receiving a synchronization signal of the output video signal and outputting an output select signal in synchronization with the synchronization signal of the output video signal; and a screen synthesis unit for receiving the outputs of the main system quality corrector and the sub system quality corrector and outputting the output video signal, in which screens are synthesized, through selection in accordance with the output select signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Thus, the structure of the sub system signal processors can be simplified, so as to reduce the circuit scale. Also, circuits to be operated by using a fast clock are restricted, so as to reduce the power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the video signal processing apparatus preferably further includes a main system video selection unit for selecting and outputting one of the outputs of the main system video signal processor and the sub system video signal processor, and the main system signal processor preferably receives, instead of the main system video signal, an output of the main system video selection unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Thus, in single screen display where the main system signal alone is output, the screen size can be reduced by effectively using the inactive sub system signal processor. Therefore, a memory of the main system signal processor need not have a capacity corresponding to the screen size of the input video signal but may have a capacity corresponding to the screen size of the output video signal. Accordingly, the memory capacity, which is conventionally necessary for an input video signal with a large screen size, can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing apparatus, the sub system signal processor preferably outputs the output thereof in synchronization with a synchronization signal of the main system video signal, and the main system video selection unit preferably performs selection of video signals input thereto at timing synchronized with the synchronization signal, performs screen synthesis and outputs a resultant signal as an output thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Thus, the main system video signal and the sub system video signals are synthesized for the screen synthesis, and the synthesized signal is processed by the main system signal processor. Therefore, the main and sub system video signals can be subjected to the same signal processing. Accordingly, a difference in the picture quality in the synthesized screen can be eliminated. In particular, in the case where the main system signal processor performs high level signal processing as compared with the sub system signal processors, both the main and sub system video signals can be subjected to the high level processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing apparatus, the main system video selection unit preferably includes multipliers, respectively corresponding to video signals input thereto, for obtaining and outputting a product of each video signal input thereto and a gain of the video signal; an adder for adding outputs of the multipliers and outputting a sum as an output thereof; and a selector for selecting and outputting one of a plurality of video signals input to the main system video selection unit and the output of the adder, and the selector is preferably used for changing timing of the selection with respect to a synchronization signal of the main system video signal, and the gains used in the multipliers are preferably changed with substantially constantly keeping a sum thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the video signal processing apparatus preferably further includes a main system horizontal reduction circuit for receiving the main system video signal, changing a number of pixels included in one line of a screen corresponding to the main system video signal to one or less time and outputting a resultant signal as an output thereof; and a sub system horizontal reduction circuit for receiving the sub system video signal, changing a number of pixels included in one line of a screen corresponding to the sub system video signal to one or less time and outputting a resultant signal as an output thereof, the main system video selection unit preferably receives, instead of the main system video signal, the output of the main system horizontal reduction circuit, and the sub system signal processor preferably receives, instead of the sub system video signal, the output of the sub system horizontal reduction circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Thus, the various signal processing are performed after reducing the number of pixels arranged in the horizontal direction in consideration of the screen size of the output video signal, and hence, the memory capacities necessary for the various signal processing parts can be reduced. Also, in the case where the sub system video signal is displayed in a child screen smaller than the screen size of the output video signal, the sub system horizontal reduction circuit can reduce the number of pixels arranged in the horizontal direction in consideration of the screen size of the child screen. Accordingly, the sub system signal processor and the like may have memories with capacities each corresponding to the size of the child screen, so that the video signal processing can be realized with a smaller memory capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> At least one of the main system horizontal reduction circuit and the sub system horizontal reduction circuit preferably reduces the number of pixels included in one line of a screen corresponding to the video signal input thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the video signal processing apparatus preferably further includes a main system quality correction selection unit for selecting one of the output of the main system signal processor and the output of the sub system signal processor and outputting the selected output; and a sub system quality correction selection unit for selecting one of the output of the main system signal processor and the output of the sub system signal processor and outputting the selected output, the main system quality corrector preferably receives, instead of the output of the main system signal processor, the output of the main system quality correction selection unit, the sub system quality corrector preferably receives, instead of the output of the sub system signal processor, the output of the sub system quality correction selection unit, and when the main system quality correction selection unit and the sub system quality correction selection unit both select the output of the main system signal processor, the main system quality corrector preferably separates, from the video signal input thereto, a signal obtained on the basis of the main system video signal, performs picture quality correction on a screen corresponding to the separated signal and outputs a resultant signal as the output, and the sub system quality corrector preferably separates, from the video signal input thereto, a signal obtained on the basis of the sub system video signal, performs the picture quality correction on a screen corresponding to the separated signal and outputs a resultant signal as the output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Thus, the video signal obtained on the basis of the main system video signal and the video signal obtained on the basis of the sub system video signal are separated from each other. Therefore, each video signal can be subjected to the picture quality correction without being harmfully affected by the other video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing apparatus, the main system quality corrector preferably performs the picture quality correction on the screen corresponding to the signal obtained on the basis of the main system video signal with pixel values of pixels outside of the screen set to a given value, and the sub system quality corrector preferably performs the picture quality correction on the screen corresponding to the signal obtained on the basis of the sub system video signal with pixel values of pixels outside of the screen set to a given value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Thus, the picture quality correction is performed after masking, with the fixed value, pixels present outside the screen corresponding to the video signal obtained on the basis of each of the main and sub system video signals. Therefore, for example, in the picture quality correction by using pixels arranged in the horizontal or vertical direction as a tap as in an HV enhancer, the quality degradation in the vicinity of the boundary between screens can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing apparatus, the main system quality corrector preferably performs the picture quality correction on the screen corresponding to the signal obtained on the basis of the main system video signal with pixel values of pixels disposed on an edge corresponding to a boundary of the screen used as pixel values of pixels in a region outside of the screen and adjacent to the edge, and the sub system quality corrector preferably performs the picture quality correction on the screen corresponding to the signal obtained on the basis of the sub system video signal with pixel values of pixels disposed on an edge corresponding to a boundary of the screen used as pixel values of pixels in a region outside of the screen and adjacent to the edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the case where the picture quality correction by using, for example, the HV enhancer, the quality degradation in the vicinity of the boundary between screens can be further suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the video signal processing apparatus, the sub system signal processor preferably includes a vertical resize frame synchronization part for performing conversion of a number of lines included in a screen corresponding to the video signal input thereto and outputting a resultant signal in synchronization with the synchronization signal of the output video signal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Now, preferred embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In each embodiment described below, a video signal processing apparatus that receives video signals of three systems as input video signals so as to select one video signal of one system as a main system video signal and another as a sub system video signal for processing will be exemplified. It is herein assumed that a mode of an object video signal means, in addition to the format of the video signal, whether multi-screen display for simultaneously displaying a plurality of screens or high quality processing is to be performed, and the number of screens and the size of each screen in the multi-screen display. Also, a synchronization signal is assumed to include a vertical synchronization signal and a horizontal synchronization signal. Furthermore, a screen size is expressed not as a physical size but as the number of pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a video signal processing apparatus according to Embodiment 1 of the invention. The video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes an input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> serving as an input signal selection unit, a timing controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> serving as a video synthesis unit and a clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> receives input video signals VI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and VI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of three systems and an input select signal SELI. These video signals are digital signals and are, for example, video signals for a TV or a PC. The input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> selects, in accordance with the input select signal SELI, one of the input video signals VI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and VI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a main system video signal VIM and another as a sub system video signal VIS, and outputs the main system video signal VIM to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the sub system video signal VIS to the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The timing controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receives synchronization signals SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and SC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> respectively corresponding to the input video signals VI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and VI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a synchronization signal SCO for an output video signal VO output from this video signal processing apparatus and the input select signal SELI. In accordance with the input select signal SELI, the timing controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> outputs a synchronization signal SCM of the video signal selected as the main system video signal VIM to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and outputs a synchronization signal SCS of the video signal selected as the sub system video signal VIS to the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Each of the synchronization signals SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, SC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, SCO, SCM and SCS includes a vertical synchronization signal, a horizontal synchronization signal and a clock of the corresponding video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Also, the timing controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> outputs a fast clock CLF and an output synchronization signal SYNO to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The output synchronization signal SYNO is a signal taken out from the synchronization signal SCO and includes vertical and horizontal synchronization signals. Furthermore, the timing controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> outputs an output select signal SELO to the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and an output clock CLO taken out from the synchronization signal SCO to the clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> respectively perform predetermined processing on the received video signals and output video signals resulting from the processing to the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> selects one of the received video signals in accordance with the output select signal SELO and outputs the selected video signal to the clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> converts the clock of the received video signal into an output clock CLO, synchronizes the video signal with the output synchronization signal SYNO and outputs the resultant signal as the output video signal VO. The output video signal VO fits the screen size or the scanning method (interlaced scanning or progressive scanning) of a display device (such as a CRT, a liquid crystal display or a PDP) used for the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a quality correction unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> receives the main system video signal VIM, the synchronization signal SCM, the fast clock CLF and the output synchronization signal SYNO. Also, the fast clock CLF and the output synchronization signal SYNO are input to the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the quality correction unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is, for example, a frame memory. The format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> writes the main system video signal VIM in the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by using a clock included in the synchronization signal SCM in synchronization with the vertical and horizontal synchronization signals included in the synchronization signal SCM of the main system video signal VIM. Thereafter, the format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> reads data from the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by using the fast clock CLF in synchronization with the output synchronization signal SYNO, and outputs the read data to the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the following description, it is assumed, for example, that the fast clock CLF has a higher frequency than any clocks of the input video signals VI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and VI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For example, the fast clock CLF has a frequency ten times as high as that of the clocks of the input video signals VI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and VI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Also, the fast clock CLF need not be in synchronization with the clocks of these input video signals. It is noted that in each composing element, a clock with a higher frequency than the clocks obtained in inputting the video signals to be processed in the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (namely, the clocks of the input video signals VI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and VI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) may be used as the fast clock, which applies to each of the embodiments described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the case where the input video signal is, for example, an interlaced signal, the format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> performs format conversion such as IP conversion for converting the interlaced signal into a progressive signal to be output. In this case, &ldquo;I&rdquo; stands for the interlaced scanning and &ldquo;P&rdquo; stands for the progressive scanning. In the case where IP conversion using information on a plurality of fields is performed as in three-dimensional IP conversion, the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may store a video signal corresponding to a plurality of fields. Thus, the main system video signal VIM is changed in the signal format, the synchronization signal and the clock thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3C</cross-reference> are explanatory diagrams for showing the relationship between the video signal, the horizontal synchronization signal and the clock. In each of these drawings, a video signal corresponding to one line of the main system video signal VIM is shown, and an arrow indicates each pulse of the clock. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows the relationship obtained in writing the main system video signal in the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The main system video signal VIM is written in the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by using the clock thereof (input clock). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows the relationship obtained in reading the video signal from the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The video signal is read from the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by using the fast clock CLF. Since the video signal is read by using the fast clock CLF, data of the same number of pixels can be read in a shorter time, and hence, an active video period corresponding to one line can be shortened. Therefore, a horizontal synchronization period can be shortened. In reverse, the horizontal synchronization period can be elongated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> shows the relationship obtained when the horizontal synchronization period is shortened. Herein, such a horizontal synchronization signal resulting from the period change is designated as a dummy output horizontal synchronization signal. The format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> generates the dummy output horizontal synchronization signal on the basis of the output horizontal synchronization signal, and outputs the dummy output horizontal synchronization signal and the read video signal to the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</cross-reference> are explanatory diagrams for showing the relationship between the video signal and the horizontal synchronization signal. In each of these drawings, a video signal corresponding to one field of the main system video signal VIM is shown, and an arrow indicates each pulse of the horizontal synchronization signal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows the relationship obtained in writing the video signal in the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows the relationship obtained in reading the video signal from the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. In the case where the horizontal synchronization period is shortened as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, all the lines included in one field can be read in a shorter time, resulting in obtaining a screen compressed in the vertical direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> shows the relationship between the output horizontal synchronization signal and the video signal. The vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> synchronizes the received video signal with the output synchronization signal SYNO, performs filtering processing and outputs the resultant signal to the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the resize in the vertical direction of a screen can be carried out, namely, the number of lines included in one screen can be converted. Although the compression in the vertical direction is described in the above, expansion in the vertical direction can be similarly carried out by elongating the dummy output horizontal synchronization period. When the dummy output horizontal synchronization period is changed, the size in the vertical direction of the screen can be continuously changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> converts the number of pixels arranged in the horizontal direction in one screen and outputs the resultant signal to the quality correction unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> writes, for example, pixel data corresponding to one line in the memory, and converts the number of pixels by reading the data in a decimated manner or reading the same pixel data a plurality of times. The quality correction unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> performs picture quality correction, such as gray level correction, enhancement processing, brightness adjustment and color processing, on the received video signal, and outputs the resultant signal to the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The description of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will be herein omitted because it is similar to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> selects, in accordance with the output select signal SELO output from the timing controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, one of the video signals output from the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and outputs the selected video signal to the clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Both the video signal output from the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the video signal output from the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are in synchronization with the output synchronization signal SYNO and output by using the fast clock CLF. Therefore, the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> selects one of these video signals in accordance with the output select signal SELO in synchronization with the output synchronization signal SYNO, so as to execute screen synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5E</cross-reference> are explanatory diagrams for showing examples of the screen synthesis. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows screens corresponding to the main system video signal VIM and the sub system video signal VIS. These signals are synthesized by the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> after the format conversion and the resize performed in the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B, 5C</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>E show examples of the synthesized screen output by the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> are explanatory diagrams for showing the operation of the clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows the relationship between the fast clock CLF and a video signal corresponding to one line, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> shows the relationship between the output clock CLO and a video signal corresponding to one line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives the video signal, which is in synchronization with the fast clock CLF. The clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> writes, for example, a video signal corresponding to one line in a line memory by using the fast clock CLF, reads the video signal by using the output clock CLO and outputs the read signal as the output video signal VO. Accordingly, the clock of the video signal can be converted into the output clock CLO to be output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As described above, the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes the input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and hence, the screen synthesis can be performed after executing the processing such as the IP conversion with two of a plurality of input video signals freely selected. Since connection between a line for transmitting the input video signal and the video signal processing apparatus can be thus physically fixed, when the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is built as one chip, there is no need to change the connection of lines outside the chip. Accordingly, by using the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the design of an actual TV, a display and a signal processing system for display can be eased. </paragraph>

As compared with the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> includes a main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> instead of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> instead of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and additionally includes a main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and a sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, whereas the clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is not included. The output clock CLO is also input to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The fast clock CLF is not input to the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes the same composing elements as the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> except for the quality correction unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The output clock CLO is input to the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are the same as those described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and hence the description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> includes a reduction filter <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, a memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and an expansion filter <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. The fast clock CLF is input to the reduction filter <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and the memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and the output synchronization signal SYNO is input to the reduction filter <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and the expansion filter <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. Also, the output clock CLO is input to the memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and the expansion filter <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The reduction filter <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> performs filtering processing on the received signal and writes the resultant signal in the memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> with pixels decimated in accordance with a necessary reduction ratio. The memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is, for example, a line memory having a capacity sufficient for storing pixel data corresponding to one line, and uses the fast clock CLF as a writing clock and the output clock CLO as a reading clock. The expansion filter <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> reads the data from the memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> with a reading address stopped in accordance with a necessary expansion ratio, performs filtering processing and outputs the resultant signal to the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> At this point, in the case where the reduction in the horizontal direction is to be performed, the expansion filter <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> reads the data from the memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and merely allows the data to pass therethrough, and in the case where the expansion in the horizontal direction is to be performed, the reduction filter <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> merely allows the received signal to pass therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> receives the output synchronization signal SYNO, and the fast clock CLF is used for writing data in the memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and the output clock CLO is used for reading data from the memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can convert the clock of the video signal into the output clock CLO and can output the video signal in synchronization with the output synchronization signal SYNO. Accordingly, there is no need to include the clock converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> includes a vertical resize frame synchronization unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and a memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is, for example, a frame memory. The vertical resize frame synchronization unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> writes the received sub system video signal VIS in the memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> by using the clock thereof in synchronization with the synchronization signal thereof, and reads the video data from the memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> by using the output clock CLO in synchronization with the output synchronization signal SYNO. Accordingly, the vertical resize frame synchronization unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can convert the clock of the video signal into the output clock CLO and can output the video signal to the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in synchronization with the output synchronization signal SYNO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The vertical resize frame synchronization unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also performs vertical resize processing. In the case where the screen is to be reduced in the vertical direction, the vertical resize frame synchronization unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> performs filtering processing on the sub system video signal VIS, writes the resultant signal in the memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> with lines decimated in accordance with a necessary reduction ratio, and then the data is read in a general manner. Since the number of lines included in one screen is thus reduced, the screen can be reduced in the vertical direction. Even when the screen size of the sub system video signal VIS is larger than the screen size of the output video signal VO, the memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> may have a capacity corresponding to the screen size of the output video signal VO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case where the screen is to be expanded in the vertical direction, the vertical resize frame synchronization unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> writes the video signal VIS in the memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in a general manner, reads the video signal with a reading address stopped so as to read the same line twice or more times in accordance with a necessary expansion ratio, and performs the filtering processing. Thus, the number of lines included in one screen is increased, and hence, the screen can be expanded in the vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the vertical resize frame synchronization unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can perform the IP conversion for converting an interlaced signal into a progressive signal by doubling the number of lines included in one field. However, the vertical resize frame synchronization unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> performs such simple IP conversion within a field alone and does not perform the IP conversion using a plurality of fields as that performed by the format converter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Therefore, the memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> need not have a capacity for storing a plurality of fields. Furthermore, since PI conversion for converting a progressive signal into an interlaced signal, II conversion and PP conversion are all line number conversion, the vertical resize frame synchronization unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can execute such conversion in the same manner as the IP conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> performs, on the received video signal, processing for converting the number of pixels included in one line into a desired number and outputs the resultant signal to the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The structure and the operation of the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are substantially the same as those of the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, whereas the output clock CLO is used instead of the fast clock CLF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> respectively perform the picture quality correction, such as the gray level correction, the enhancement processing, the brightness adjustment and the color processing, on the received video signals, and output the resultant signals to the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by using the output clock CLO in synchronization with the output synchronization signal SYNO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> selects one of the video signals output from the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> in accordance with the output select signal SELO output from the timing controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and outputs the selected video signal as the output video signal VO. At this point, the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can perform the screen synthesis, for example, as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B through 5E</cross-reference> by appropriately switching the received two video signals to be output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In this manner, in the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is simplified as compared with the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and hence, the circuit scale can be reduced. In the case where two screens are simultaneously displayed as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B through 5E</cross-reference>, one screen is occasionally smaller than the other, and hence, rather low picture quality due to the simplification of the processing such as the IP conversion does not cause any serious problem in the small screen. Also, the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> alone is operated with the frequency of the fast clock CLF and the other composing elements are operated with comparatively low frequencies of the output clock CLO and the like. Therefore, power consumption can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can perform high level image processing such as the IP conversion using a plurality of fields. Also, since the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is operated in accordance with the fast clock CLF, the vertical screen size can be resized to a desired size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, one of the input video signals is processed by using the main system signal processor and another is processed by the sub system signal processor. There is no need to previously determine which input video signals are to be processed by the main system signal processor and the sub system signal processor, but signals to be processed by these processors can be freely selected from the input video signals at any time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 3 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a video signal processing apparatus according to Embodiment 3 of the invention. The video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> includes, in addition to the composing elements of the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> serving as a main system video selection unit. In order to avoid complication, the timing controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the synchronization signal and the clock are omitted in the drawings referred to below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> receives the main system video signal VIM and the output signal of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> selects one of these signals in accordance with the main system select signal SELM output from the timing controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and outputs the selected signal to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In Embodiment 3, the case where the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> processes a video signal obtained after an input video signal of one system is reduced in the number of pixels included in one screen by the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> It is assumed that the number of pixels included in one screen of an input video signal is larger than the number of pixels included in one screen of the output video signal VO, and specifically, it is assumed that a hi-vision signal of, for example, 1125i (namely, an interlaced signal including 1125 lines in one screen) is input and IP converted to be output with a size of a SVGA (super video graphics array; having 800 pixels in the horizontal direction and 600 lines in the vertical direction). The effective video region of this hi-vision signal is 1920 pixels in the horizontal direction and 540 lines in the vertical direction per field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In a single screen mode of the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> selects an input video signal of one system and the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> performs the processing such as the IP conversion and the resize processing on the selected video signal. In this case, the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> needs to have a capacity for storing data of 1920&times;540 pixels (which is the number of pixels of one field). Also, in order to generate a vertical tap necessary for the vertical filtering processing, the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> needs to have a line memory with a capacity for storing data of 1920 pixels. On the other hand, the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is not specifically operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in this embodiment, the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> first decimates the lines included in one screen and the pixels included in one line of the video signal, so as to convert the format of the video signal into a format of the output video signal VO, that is, the ultimate output. At this point, the IP conversion is not performed. Thereafter, the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> receives the video signal resulting from the decimation, and hence, the necessary memory capacity of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be largely reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> selects, in accordance with the input select signal SELI, one of the input video signals VI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and VI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as the sub system video signal VIS, and outputs the selected video signal to the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> performs the vertical and horizontal resize processing on the received video signal, and outputs the resultant signal to the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> selects the output of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in accordance with the main system select signal SELM, and outputs the selected signal to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> performs the format conversion such as the IP conversion and the vertical and horizontal resize processing on the received video signal, and outputs the resultant signal to the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> performs the picture quality correction on the output of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and outputs the resultant signal to the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Since the operations of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are the same as those described in Embodiment 2, the detailed description is omitted. The video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> selects the output of the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in accordance with the output select signal SELO, and outputs the selected signal as the output video signal VO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In this manner, when merely one input video signal is processed, the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which is otherwise inactive, is effectively used. Therefore, the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> does not need to have a capacity corresponding to the screen size of the input video signal but may have a capacity corresponding to the screen size of the output video signal. Accordingly, the memory capacity, which is necessary for an input video signal with a large screen size, can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 4 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a video signal processing apparatus according to Embodiment 4 of the invention. As compared with the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> includes a sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> instead of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and additionally includes a main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The other composing elements are the same as those described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 11</cross-reference> and the description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> outputs the selected main system video signal VIM to the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the selected sub system video signal VIS to the sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> includes a reduction filter <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and a memory <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The reduction filter <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> receives the clock CLM and the synchronization signal SYNM of the main system video signal VIM. The memory <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> receives the clock CLM as a writing and reading clock. The clock CLM and the synchronization signal SYNM are together shown as the synchronization signal SCM in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The reduction filter <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> performs the filtering processing on the received main system video signal VIM and writes data in the memory <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> with pixels decimated in accordance with a necessary reduction ratio. The video signal is decimated, for example, so that data of pixels included in one line of a screen of the output video signal VO can be written. The memory <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is, for example, a line memory having a capacity sufficient for storing the data of pixels included in one line of the output video signal VO, and uses the clock CLM as the writing and reading clock. Since the data having been written with decimation is read from the memory <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, the reduction in the horizontal direction of the screen can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> selects the output of the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and outputs the selected signal to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The output of the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be directly supplied to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> with the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is the same as the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> except that it uses the clock and the synchronization signal of the sub system video signal VIS, and hence the detailed description is omitted. The sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> performs the horizontal reduction processing on the sub system video signal VIS and outputs the resultant signal to the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is the same as the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> except that it does not include the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the vertical resize frame synchronization unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> sends its output to the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Similarly to Embodiment 2, the screen synthesis, for example, as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B through 5E</cross-reference> can be performed by appropriately switching the received two video signals to be output by the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In this manner, according to Embodiment 4, the respective signal processing are performed after reducing the number of horizontally arranged pixels in consideration of the number of horizontally arranged pixels included in the screen of the output video signal VO, and therefore, the memory capacities necessary for the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can be reduced. Also, in the case where the screen of the sub system is not full-screen displayed, for example, in the case where the number of pixels arranged in the horizontal direction can be always defined as a half or less of the pixels included in one line, the memory capacity of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can be one for storing data of a half of the pixels included in one screen of the output video signal VO. Thus, the video signal processing can be realized with a smaller memory capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the data is read from the memory <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by using the clock CLM of the received video signal. Instead, the data may be read by using the fast clock CLF. In this case, the data is written in the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by using the fast clock CLF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 5 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In Embodiment 5, the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is used for the screen synthesis differently from Embodiment 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A through 15C</cross-reference> are explanatory diagrams for showing timings of the video signals output from the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the output of the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> reduces the horizontal size of the screen of the main system video signal VIM selected by the input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and outputs the resultant signal to the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> reduces the horizontal size of the screen of the sub system video signal VIS selected by the input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and outputs the resultant signal to the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Each of the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> reduces the horizontal size to, for example, a half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> shows the timing of the video signal output from the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> with respect to the horizontal synchronization signal of the main system video signal VIM. Thus, the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> reads the data from the memory so that the screen of the main system video signal can be displayed in the left half area of the display. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference> shows the timing of the video signal output from the sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with respect to the horizontal synchronization signal of the sub system video signal VIS. Thus, the sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> reads the data from the memory so that the screen of the sub system video signal can be displayed in the right half area of the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> performs the frame synchronization and the vertical resize processing on the output of the sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the same manner as in Embodiment 4. However, in this embodiment, the frame synchronization is carried out so as to synchronize not with the output synchronization signal but with the synchronization signal SYNM of the main system video signal VIM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The output of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is input to the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> switches the input on the basis of the main system select signal SELM. The signals of the two systems input to the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are both in synchronization with the main system video signal VIM, and hence, the screen synthesis can be eased. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</cross-reference> shows an example of the synthesized screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> selects merely the output of the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to output. The operation of the video signal processing apparatus of this embodiment is the same as that of the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> except for that described above, and hence the description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> performs the screen synthesis in Embodiment 5. For example, in the case where both the main system video signal VIM and the sub system video signal VIS are interlaced signals, the sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> respectively perform the resize processing and the frame synchronization on the sub system video signal VIS kept as the interlaced signal. Thereafter, the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> synthesizes the output of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> with the main system video signal VIM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Therefore, even when the IP conversion using information on other fields cannot be performed in the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, both the main system video signal VIM and the sub system video signal VIS can be subjected to high level IP conversion by using information on other fields for attaining high picture quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In particular, when the screens of the main system video signal VIM and the sub system video signal VIS are displayed in the same size as in the synthesized screen of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>C, if the methods of the IP conversion are different between the two screens, the difference in the picture quality between the two screens is disadvantageously obvious. However, there is no difference in the picture quality between the two screens according to this embodiment. Furthermore, after the screen synthesis, the screen size can be resized to an arbitrary size by the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a block diagram of an exemplified structure of the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> includes multipliers <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>, an adder <highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight> and a selector <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The multiplier <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> receives the main system video signal and a gain G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The gain G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a value of 0 through 1, and the multiplier <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> obtains a product of the main system video signal and the gain G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputs the obtained product to the adder <highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the multiplier <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> receives the sub system video signal and a gain G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The gain G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a value of 0 through 1, and the multiplier <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> obtains a product of the sub system video signal and the gain G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and outputs the obtained product to the adder <highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The adder <highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight> adds the outputs of the multipliers <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> and outputs the obtained sum to the selector <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight>. At this point, when the sum of the gains G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 1, the adder <highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight> can appropriately blends the outputs of the multipliers <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>. The adder <highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight> may perform limiter processing so as not to output a value exceeding a given value. The selector <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> selects, in accordance with the main system select signal SELM, one of the main system video signal, the sub system video signal and the output of the adder <highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight>, and outputs the selected signal to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the selector <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> may select either the main system video signal or the sub system video signal in accordance with the main system select signal SELM. The main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> can additionally perform the following operations: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> For example, when the selector <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> is set to select the output of the adder <highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight> and the values of the gains G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are gradually varied every vertical blanking of the main system video signal, the video signal output from the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can attain an effect that the proportion between the main system video signal and the sub system video signal is gradually changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the selector <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> is set to select either the main system video signal or the sub system video signal. When the main system select signal SELM is controlled so that the selection of the selector <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> is switched in a predetermined position within one horizontal scanning period and in a horizontal blanking period of the main system video signal and the switching position is gradually changed in the horizontal direction every vertical blanking, a screen switching effect for wiping out a displayed image in the horizontal direction can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> may be used as the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 7</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the like, and thus, the same effect can be attained. Also, although the input video signals are two systems in the above description, they may be three or more systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to Embodiment 5, although the circuit scale of the sub system signal processor is small, both the main system video signal and the sub system video signal can be subjected to the same processing. In particular, when these video signals are subjected to the IP conversion, no difference is caused in the picture quality between screens obtained by the screen synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 6 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a video signal processing apparatus according to Embodiment 6 of the invention. The video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> includes, in addition to the composing elements of the video signal processing apparatus of Embodiment 5 described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> serving as a main system quality correction selection unit and a sub system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> serving as a sub system quality correction selection unit. Also, the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 5 are respectively replaced with a main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and a sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The remaining structure is the same as that of Embodiment 5 and hence the detailed description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> receives the outputs of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> selects one of these outputs in accordance with a quality correction select signal SEL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> output from the timing controller and outputs the selected signal to the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The sub system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> similarly receives the outputs of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The sub system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> selects one of these outputs in accordance with a quality correction select signal SEL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> output from the timing controller and outputs the selected signal to the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> When the main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> selects the output of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> selects the output of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, this video signal processing apparatus is operated in the same manner as that of Embodiment 5. In Embodiment 6, both the main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> select the output of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a video signal obtained through the screen synthesis of the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the processing such as the format conversion of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is input to the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> may not include the main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In other words, in the video signal processing apparatus of Embodiment 5 (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> may be directly supplied with the output of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> instead of the output of the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> includes a selector <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> and a quality correction circuit <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. The selector <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> receives the video signal output from the main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a predetermined fixed value. The selector <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> selects and outputs, in accordance with the output select signal SELO, the received video signal in a period when the video signal is obtained on the basis of the main system video signal VIM, and otherwise, the fixed value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A through 19D</cross-reference> are explanatory diagrams for showing screens to be corrected in the picture quality by the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</cross-reference> shows a screen corresponding to the output of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In this screen, a screen based on the main system video signal VIM (namely, a main region) and a screen based on the sub system video signal VIS (namely, a sub region) are displayed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</cross-reference> shows a screen corresponding to the output of the selector <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>. The quality correction circuit <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> corrects the picture quality of a signal obtained by masking an area other than the main region (namely, a hatched area) with the fixed value, and outputs the resultant signal to the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The structure of the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> is the same as that of the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. The selector of the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> selects the received video signal in a period when the video signal is obtained on the basis of the sub system video signal VIS, and otherwise, the fixed value. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</cross-reference> shows a screen corresponding to the output of the selector of the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The quality correction circuit of the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> corrects the picture quality of a signal obtained by masking an area other than the sub region (namely, a hatched area) with the fixed value, and outputs the resultant signal to the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> selects one of the outputs of the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> in accordance with the output select signal SELO, performs the screen synthesis and outputs the resultant signal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</cross-reference> shows a screen corresponding to the output of the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The quality correction circuit <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> performs processing by using an HV enhancer or the like. In this case, if an operation is carried out, on a boundary around the screen, between a pixel within the screen and another pixel of a different screen outside, the picture quality on the boundary is lowered. Since a portion outside the screen is defined as the fixed value in this embodiment, the lowering of the picture quality in the vicinity of the boundary can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a modification of the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> may include a main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> instead of the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. In this case, the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> is replaced with a sub system quality corrector similar to the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> includes a boundary hold circuit <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> and a quality correction circuit <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>. The boundary hold circuit <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> receives the video signal output from the main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The boundary hold circuit <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> outputs, in accordance with the output select signal SELO, the received video signal in a period when the video signal is obtained based on the main system video signal VIM. Otherwise, the boundary hold circuit <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> holds the values of the boundary of the screen of this video signal and output the held values. At this point, the values of pixels included in one line are held as the values of the upper end of the screen, and those included in another line are held as the values of the lower end thereof. The value of one pixel is held as the value of the right end in each line, and that of another pixel is held as the value of the left end therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A through 21D</cross-reference> are explanatory diagrams for showing screens to be corrected in the picture quality by the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> and the equivalent sub system quality corrector. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</cross-reference> shows a screen corresponding to the output of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</cross-reference> shows a screen corresponding to the output of the boundary hold circuit <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight>. The quality correction circuit <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> corrects the picture quality of a signal obtained by masking an area other than the main region with the boundary values held by the boundary hold circuit <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight>, and outputs the resultant to the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</cross-reference> shows a screen corresponding to the output of the boundary hold circuit of the sub system quality corrector. The quality correction circuit of the sub system quality corrector corrects the picture quality of a signal obtained by masking an area other than the sub region with the boundary values held by the boundary hold circuit, and outputs the resultant signal to the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> selects one of the two inputs in accordance with the output select signal SELO, performs the screen synthesis and outputs the resultant signal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21D</cross-reference> shows a screen corresponding to the output of the video mix selector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In this manner, since the pixel value of the boundary of the screen is used as a pixel value in an outside area of the screen, the lowering of the picture quality in the vicinity of the boundary can be suppressed. In this case, the lowering of the picture quality in the vicinity of the boundary can be more effectively suppressed than in the case where an area outside the screen is masked with a fixed value. Although the pixel values of the boundaries in all the four areas above, below and on the right and left sides of the screen are used in the above, the pixel values of the boundaries merely in the three or less areas may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a flowchart for showing procedures in the processing performed by the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. In step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the screen synthesis is performed, namely, whether or not input signals are synthesized to obtain multi-screen display. When the screen synthesis is performed, the procedure proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and when not, the procedure proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, video signals of, for example, two systems are selected from the input video signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the sub system video signal is also processed through the IP conversion or the like to attain high quality. When the high quality processing is performed, the procedure proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and when not, the procedure proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the screen size of the sub system video signal is larger than a predetermined size. When the screen size is larger than the predetermined size, the procedure proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and otherwise, the procedure proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the screen size of the sub system video signal is reduced. At this point, as described with respect to the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the inactive sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be effectively used. Thereafter, the main and sub system video signals are synthesized by the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>), and the resultant signal is subjected to the signal processing such as the IP conversion by the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the lowering in the picture quality on the boundary of the synthesized screen is allowable. When the quality lowering is not allowable, the procedure proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and otherwise, the procedure proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the picture quality is corrected after separating the main and sub system video signals from each other, and thereafter, the video signals are synthesized again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a video signal of one system is selected from the input video signals. In step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> performs the signal processing such as the IP conversion on the selected video signal, and the picture quality is corrected in step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> respectively perform the signal processing such as the IP conversion on the main and sub system video signals. In step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the processed signals are corrected in the picture qualities, and in step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the two signals resulting from the picture quality correction are synthesized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the synthesized screen is corrected in the picture quality without separating the video signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> includes a plurality of signal processing parts, namely, the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the sub system signal processor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the main system quality corrector <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, the sub system quality corrector <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, the main system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the sub system horizontal reduction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so as to select signal processing parts to be used for the processing of a selected video signal from them and to determine the order of the processing operations of the selected signal processing parts. Such selection and determination can be made depending upon the mode of a video signal to be ultimately obtained as the output, such as whether or not video signals are synthesized to obtain multi-screen display and whether or not high picture quality processing is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In this manner, according to Embodiment 6, a video signal obtained on the basis of the main system video signal VIM and a video signal obtained on the basis of the sub system video signal VIS are separated from each other. Thereafter, each video signal obtained by the separation is corrected in the picture quality after masking an outside area of the screen of the video signal with a fixed value or a pixel value of the boundary, and then, the resultant signals are synthesized again for screen synthesis. Accordingly, in the case where pixels arranged in the horizontal or vertical direction are used as a tap in the picture quality correction using, for example, the HV enhancer, the lowering of the picture quality in the vicinity of the boundary between the screens can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> can perform the same operation as that of the video signal processing apparatus of any of Embodiments 2 through 5 when the order of the processing is changed by appropriately changing the selection in the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In Embodiment 7 of the invention, the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is replaced with a main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. The other composing elements are the same as those described in Embodiment 6 and hence the description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 7. The main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> includes a format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and selectors <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The selectors <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> receive a main system signal processing select signal SELMS output from the timing controller (not shown). Each of the selectors <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> selects and outputs one of the two inputs in accordance with the select signal SELMS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Although not shown in the drawing, the selector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> selects, in accordance with the select signal SELMS, a synchronization signal and a clock necessary for the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and supplies the selected signals to the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the selectors <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> select synchronization signals and clocks necessary for the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and supply the selected signals to them. The vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be supplied with a fast clock if necessary or a clock with a lower frequency than the fast clock. The synchronization signal may be the synchronization signal of one of the video signals selected by the input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or the output synchronization signal SYNO separated from the externally input synchronization signal SCO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> When the select signal SELMS is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the selector <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> selects the video signal input to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and when the select signal SELMS is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, it selects the output of the format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and outputs the selected signal to the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the select signal SELMS is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the selector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> selects the output of the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and when the select signal SELMS is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, it selects the video signal input to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and outputs the selected signal to the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> stores the received video signal and outputs the stored signal to the format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. When the select signal SELMS is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the selector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> selects the output of the format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and when the select signal SELMS is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, it selects the output of the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and outputs the selected signal to the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Now, the operation of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> performed when the select signal SELMS is &ldquo;1&rdquo; will be described. First, the video signal output from the main system input selector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is input to the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through the selector <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> converts the number of lines included in one screen of the received video signal so as to match with the number of lines included in one screen of the output video signal VO. Specifically, the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> processes the video signal by using the reduction filter and then writes the resultant signal in the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, through the selector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, with the lines decimated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> When the video signal is an interlaced signal, the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> holds a plurality of fields of written data and outputs, to the format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the video signal corresponding to a plurality of fields having been reduced in the vertical direction. The format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> performs the IP conversion by using this data corresponding to the plural fields. It goes without saying that when the video signal is not an interlaced signal, the IP conversion is not necessary. The format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> sends its output to the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> through the selector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The horizontal resize operation performed at this point is the same as that described above. The horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> sends its output to the main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Since the data are written in the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with the number of vertical lines previously reduced when the select signal SELMS is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the memory capacity can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> performed when the select signal SELMS is &ldquo;0&rdquo; will be described. The video signal input to the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is input to the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> through the selector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and then stored in the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. When the video signal is an interlaced signal, the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> reads data corresponding to a plurality of fields by using the fast clock in synchronization with the output video signal VO, and outputs the read data to the format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. At this point, the data may be read in synchronization with the dummy output horizontal synchronization signal obtained in consideration of the vertical resize as described in Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> performs the IP conversion by using the data of the plural fields, and outputs the resultant signal to the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through the selector <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> converts the number of lines of the received video signal, and outputs the resultant signal to the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> through the selector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> reads the data by using the output clock while converting the number of pixels included in one line as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and outputs the resultant signal to the main system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the sub system quality correction selector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In this manner, when the select signal SELMS is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is operated in the same manner as the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> In the case where the screen size of the input video signal is small, namely, in the case where the memory capacity necessary for the format conversion like the IP conversion is smaller than the capacity of the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the timing controller sets the main system signal processing select signal SELMS to &ldquo;0&rdquo;, so as to make the main system signal processor perform a general operation. On the other hand, in the case where the screen size of the input video signal is large, namely, in the case where the necessary memory capacity is larger than the capacity of the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the timing controller sets the select signal SELMS to &ldquo;1&rdquo;, so that the processing like IP conversion can be performed after previously converting the number of lines included in one screen of the input video signal into the number of lines included in one screen of the output video signal VO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The main system signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> according to any of Embodiments 2 through 5 may be replaced with the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is a flowchart for showing procedures in the processing performed by the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. In step S<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the screen size of the input video signal is large, namely, whether or not the memory capacity necessary for the format conversion like the IP conversion is larger than the capacity of the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. When the screen size is large, the procedure proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and otherwise, the procedure proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the select signal SELMS is set to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Thereafter, the processing are performed in the order of the vertical resize (step S<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>), the data storage in the memory and the data reading (step S<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>), the format conversion (step S<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>) and the horizontal resize (step S<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the select signal SELMS is set to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Thereafter, the processing are performed in the order of the data storage in the memory and the data reading (step S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>), the format conversion (step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>), the vertical resize (step S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>) and the horizontal resize (step S<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In this manner, when the main system signal processor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is used in the video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the order of the processing operations of the signal processing parts, namely, the format conversion unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the memory <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, can be determined in accordance with the format of an input video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to Embodiment 7, the order of the processing operations of the respective signal processing parts of the main system signal processor can be changed in accordance with the screen size of an input video signal. Therefore, in the case where the number of lines included in one screen of the input video signal is large, the lines can be previously reduced before writing the signal in the memory. Accordingly, a system coping with a large number of video signal formats can be constructed without increasing the capacity of the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 8 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a video signal processing apparatus according to Embodiment 8 of the invention. The video signal processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> includes an input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a main system memory <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a sub system memory <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a time division multiplexing selector <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a format converter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a quality corrector <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and a screen synthesis/clock conversion unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The time division multiplexing selector <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the format converter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the quality corrector <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are operated in synchronization with one another in accordance with a time division multiplexing control signal CTD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The input signal selector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> selects a main system video signal and a sub system video signal from input video signals, and writes the selected video signals in the main system memory <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the sub system memory <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, respectively. The main system memory <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the sub system memory <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> perform the reading operation by using a fast clock CLF, and output the read video signals to the time division multiplexing selector <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is an explanatory diagram for showing the time division multiplexing of the video signals. Since the reading operations of the main system memory <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the sub system memory <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are in synchronization with the same synchronization signal, the read main and sub system video signals are in synchronization with each other. At this point, for example, in the case where a main system screen is displayed in a left area of the display and a sub system screen is displayed in a right area of the display, the main system video signal and the sub system video signal are read in this order after the horizontal synchronization signal of the output video signal VO as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. The time division multiplexing selector <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> selects one of the outputs of the main system memory <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the sub system memory <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the basis of the time division multiplexing control signal CTD, so as to output, to the format converter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a video signal obtained by time division multiplexing the main system video signal and the sub system video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The format converter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the quality corrector <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> disposed at the following stages receive this time division multiplexed video signal and perform predetermined processing on the main system video signal and the sub system video signal in synchronization with the time division multiplexing control signal CTD. The processing performed by the format converter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the vertical resize unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the horizontal resize unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the quality corrector <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are the same as those described in Embodiments 1 through 7, and hence the detailed description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The processing performed on the main system video signal and the sub system video signal may be the same or different with a different parameter or the like. The quality corrector <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> performs filtering processing on the received video signal and outputs the resultant signal to the screen synthesis/clock conversion unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</cross-reference> are explanatory diagrams for showing examples of an input/output signal of the screen synthesis/clock conversion unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The screen synthesis/clock conversion unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes a frame memory <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and a memory control/screen synthesis part <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The frame memory <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> stores the received video signal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</cross-reference> shows an example of the screen corresponding to the video signal input to the frame memory <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The memory control/screen synthesis part <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> reads the data from the frame memory <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> by using the output clock CLO while controlling the reading address for the screen synthesis, and outputs the read data as the output video signal VO. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</cross-reference> shows an example of the screen corresponding to the output video signal VO output by the memory control/screen synthesis part <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> when the signal of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</cross-reference> is input to the frame memory <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> In this manner, according to Embodiment 8, the main system video signal and the sub system video signal necessary for generating the output video signal are previously time division multiplexed, and the thus obtained video signal of one system is subjected to the predetermined processing. Since there is no need to provide circuits for performing video signal processing respectively on the main system video signal and the sub system video signal, the circuit scale can be largely reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The time division multiplexing for arranging two screens in the horizontal direction is employed in this embodiment, which does not limit the invention. Also, although the two signals, namely, the main system video signal and the sub system video signal, are subjected to the time division multiplexing in this embodiment, three or more signals may be subjected to the time division multiplexing. It goes without saying that the effect to reduce the circuit scale can be more remarkable when a larger number of video signals are multiplexed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> In each of the aforementioned embodiments, the description is made on the assumption that the input video signals are three systems, that each of the main system video signal and the sub system video signal is one system and that the output video signal is one system. The input video signals may be four or more systems and the sub system video signal may be two or more systems. In other words, the video signal processing apparatus of this invention receives, as inputs, video signals of n systems (wherein n is a natural number), from which one system is selected as a main system video signal and (m-1) systems (wherein m is a natural number smaller than n) are selected as sub system video signals, so that the output video signal may be generated to be output on the basis of the selected video signals of m systems. In this case, each of the sub system signal processor, the sub system quality corrector, the sub system horizontal reduction circuit and the like should be m-1 in number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Also, although the output synchronization signal is externally input in each embodiment, the same effect can be attained by using the synchronization signal of one of the input video signals so as to synchronize the other signals with this synchronization signal. Although the dummy output synchronization signal used for the vertical resize processing in the vertical resize unit is generated from the output synchronization signal in the embodiment, the dummy output synchronization signal may be externally input or may be supplied by the timing controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The internal structures of the main system signal processor and the sub system signal processor are not limited those described in the aforementioned embodiments but any other structure may be employed as far as the same signal processing can be performed. Also, the order of the processing may be different. Furthermore, the content of the signal processing performed by the quality corrector is not limited to that described in the embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> As described so far, according to the invention, a limited number of circuits and limited memory capacities can be maximally utilized since the processing order is changed by switching the connection among circuits for performing the signal processing in accordance with the formats of input video signals and the necessary mode of an output video signal. As a result, a video signal processing apparatus capable of coping with a larger number of kinds of video signal formats can be realized. </paragraph>
