<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to technology for detecting force acting on a vehicle wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One example of a conventional device for detecting force acting on a vehicle wheel detects a force acting on a tire in a vehicle and is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 9-2240. The device in this publication is installed in a vehicle which includes a vehicle wheel in which a tire is mounted on the outer periphery of a disc wheel, and a vehicle body having a retaining body that rotatably retains the vehicle wheel integrally with the disc wheel by having the disc wheel mounted on the same axis as the vehicle wheel. The retaining body in this case may be referred to as a hub, a hub carrier, a carrier, a spindle, or a disc wheel support or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The publication further discloses that an existing vehicle axle is selected as a part of the vehicle to which a stress sensor, which serves as the device for detecting force acting on a tire, is mounted. However, when the device for detecting force acting on a tire is mounted on an existing part in a vehicle, it is easily restricted by that existing part. Therefore when using the device for detecting force acting on a tire disclosed in the aforementioned publication, it is difficult to detect with sufficiently high accuracy the necessary force acting on the tire. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An object of this invention is to facilitate highly accurate detection of force acting on a vehicle wheel, for example, on which a tire may be mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the following aspects can be obtained. The aspects are described divided into sections with each aspect corresponding to one section, and each section having an individual section number. When appropriate, the section numbers of other sections will be quoted. This is to facilitate understanding of both the technical characteristics disclosed in this specification, as well as the multiple combinations thereof. The technical characteristics disclosed in this specification, as well as the combinations thereof, should by no means be understood to be limited to the following aspects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (Section 1) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention relates to a device for detecting force acting on a vehicle wheel, which is mounted in a vehicle and which includes a disc wheel, and a vehicle body having a retaining body that rotatably retains the vehicle wheel integrally with the disc wheel by having the disc wheel mounted on the same axis as the vehicle wheel. The device includes a detector mounted between the disc wheel and the retaining body in a state where force is being transmitted therebetween, which detects force acting on the vehicle wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This device makes it possible to detect force acting on the vehicle wheel without being restricted by either the disc wheel or the retaining body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as opposed to a direct detection method in which a detector of the device for detecting force acting on a vehicle wheel is mounted on the vehicle wheel itself or on an existing member which rotates together with the vehicle wheel, this device makes it easy to design the arrangement, structure and shape and the like of parts necessary for the detection of force acting on a vehicle wheel with a high degree of flexibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, this device makes it easy to improve the accuracy of detection of force acting on the vehicle wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also, according to this device, standardization of the arrangement, structure and shape and the like of parts used for the detection of force acting on the vehicle wheel, for example, makes it is easy to improve versatility of the device for use in a plurality of contrasting environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further, this device detects force acting on the vehicle wheel in a portion where force is transmitted between the disc wheel and the retaining body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as opposed to an indirect detection method in which a detector of the device for detecting force acting on a vehicle wheel is mounted on a separate existing member which is independent of, and does not rotate with but receives force from, the vehicle wheel itself and an existing member that rotates together with the vehicle wheel, this device facilitates the accurate incorporation of a sufficient amount of information necessary for accurate detection of force acting on the vehicle wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the device makes it easy to improve the accuracy of detection of force acting on the vehicle wheel by also relying on that incorporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In Section 1, force includes axial force, meaning force in the narrow sense of the word, as well as rotational force, which corresponds to moment or torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Also in Section 1, vehicle wheel can refer to a driven vehicle wheel that is driven by a power source of the vehicle, as well as to a non-driven vehicle wheel that rotates but which is not driven by the power source of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Also in Section 1, the detector can be constructed to detect only one type of force acting on a vehicle wheel or a plurality of types of force acting on a vehicle wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (Section 2) </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> (Section 5) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A fifth aspect of the invention relates to a device for detecting force acting on a vehicle wheel described in any one of Sections 1 through 4 and in which the detector includes: i) a moving portion on the disc wheel side (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;first moving portion&rdquo;) and a moving portion on the retaining body side (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;second moving portion&rdquo;) both provided between, and on the same axis as, the disc wheel and the retaining body, and which move together with the disc wheel and the retaining body, respectively, and ii) a detecting portion that detects force acting on the vehicle wheel based on the relative displacement of the first moving portion and the second moving portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> This device detects force acting on a vehicle wheel using the relative displacement of the first moving portion and the second moving portion, which reflects the force acting on the vehicle wheel. Moreover, the relative displacement is easily expressed as a phenomenon that distinctly reflects force acting on the vehicle wheel by the relative displacement in the disc wheel or the retaining body. Therefore, this device makes it easy to improve the accuracy of detection of force acting on the vehicle wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In Section 5, the motion includes both linear motion as well as rotational motion. Also in Section 5, the detecting portion can be constructed to detect the relative displacement of the first moving portion and the second moving portion by focusing on mechanical phenomena, electrical phenomena, electromagnetic phenomena, or optical phenomena. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In Section 19, the number of detecting portions can be two, three, four, or five or more, for example. However, in view of designing the device, it is preferable to set the number of detecting portions so that at least one detecting portion is effectively functioning at any one instant when the position of the effectively functioning detecting portion changes according to the rotation angle of the vehicle wheel, rather than having all of the plurality of detecting portions always effectively functioning.

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> According to this device, strain or force generated in the detecting element of the detecting portion is reduced in proportion to the load transmitted from the first moving portion and the second moving portion to the detecting portion thereof. Accordingly, it is easy to reduce the load capacity that the detecting element must withstand. Therefore, the device makes it easy to reduce the capacity of the detecting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Reducing the load capacity of the detecting element also reduces the maximum load that the detecting element must detect.

Accordingly, this device makes it easy to reduce the capacity of the detecting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Reducing the load capacity of the detecting portion also reduces the maximum load that the detecting portion must detect. This means that it is easy to increase the detection sensitivity of the detecting element with the range width of the output signal from the detecting element under the same conditions. Therefore, the device according to this section makes it easy to improve the accuracy of detection of force acting on the vehicle wheel by increasing the sensitivity of the detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In Section 28, the set limit can be defined as the amount of load corresponding to an upper limit value of an actual use region of the force acting on the vehicle wheel, for example.

Further according to this device, because a preload is ultimately applied to the detecting portion as well, when the detecting portion is operating normally, the output signal from the detecting portion indicates a specific value that is not 0 when the force acting on the vehicle wheel is 0. Therefore according to this device, when the output signal from the detecting portion indicates 0 when the force acting on the vehicle wheel is 0, it is possible, for example, to determine that there may be an abnormality in the detecting portion itself or in a portion that transmits force to the detecting portion. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The exemplary embodiments are arrangements in which a tire is mounted on a periphery of a disc wheel. As such, the detected force is a force acting on the tire. This force acting on the tire is more generically referred to as a force acting on the vehicle wheel. The invention is not limited to vehicle wheels in which a tire is mounted on a periphery of a disc wheel. For example, the invention also is applicable to train wheels in which the vehicle wheel includes a disc wheel with no tire mounted thereon. Thus, the invention is applicable to vehicle wheels without tires as well as to vehicle wheels that include tires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a front view and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a sectional view of the device for detecting force acting on a tire according to the first embodiment of the invention. This device for detecting force acting on a tire is constructed so as to include a detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> only show the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> This device for detecting force acting on a tire is used mounted in a vehicle provided with a plurality of vehicle wheels. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each vehicle wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed of a rubber tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> mounted on the periphery of a steel disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The plurality of these vehicle wheels <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes at least one driven vehicle wheel that is driven by a power source of the vehicle and at least one non-driven wheel that rotates but which is not driven by the power source of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> For each vehicle wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the vehicle has a hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which serves as a retaining body that rotatably retains the vehicle wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> integrally with the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> because the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is mounted on the same axis as the vehicle wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted on the vehicle by being detachably mounted between the hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of each vehicle wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted in the vehicle in a state where force is being transmitted between the hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also shows the types of force acting on the tire that are detected by the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Those forces include rotational torque T based on longitudinal force (component Fx in direction X of the road surface reaction force) on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, lateral force SF (component Fy in direction Y of the road surface reaction force) on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and vertical force VF (component Fz in direction Z of the road surface reaction force) on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In this case, rotational torque T includes both driving torque and braking torque. Accordingly, longitudinal force includes both driving force and braking force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed by fitting together two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that can be relatively displaced. Both of the partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also have a cup shape in which the diameter of bottom portions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is longer than cylindrical portions <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are high. These two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are fitted together oriented with the inside surfaces of the bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> facing each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In this exemplary embodiment, of the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the one with the larger diameter is denoted as the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is detachably mounted on, and on the same axis as, the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with four tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The partition housing with the smaller diameter, on the other hand, is denoted as the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is detachably mounted on, and on the same axis as, the hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with four hub mounting bolts, not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, each of the four tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted from the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> side such that the shaft portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of each of the four tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> protrudes through the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of each of the four tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is enclosed by the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. However, each tire mounting bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used to firmly mount the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a state where relative displacement of each tire mounting bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with respect to the first housing is prevented, while relative displacement thereof with respect to the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is permitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Conversely, each of the four hub mounting bolts, not shown, is such that the shaft portion thereof protrudes through to the inside of the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, while the head portion of each of the four mounting bolts is enclosed by the hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows through-holes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through which the four hub mounting bolts are fitted. These four hub mounting bolts are used to firmly attach the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> That is, according to this exemplary embodiment, the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> constitutes one example of the first moving portion and the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> constitutes one example of the second moving portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Moreover, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view showing the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as seen from the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> side looking toward the hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> side, in a state in which the bottom portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has been removed. In contrast to this, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sectional view taken along line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the direction of rotation of the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which follows the rotation of the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when the vehicle is moving forward, is expressed as &ldquo;direction of forward rotation&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> center shaft portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> extends outward from the inside surface of the bottom portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the same axis. A center cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> also extends outward from the inside surface of the bottom portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> opposite from the center shaft portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The center shaft portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is slidably fitted with, and on the same axis as, the center cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> coil spring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which serves as an elastic member, is disposed between the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. This coil spring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> urges the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> toward each other. Accordingly, a preload is applied between the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the explanation above, according to this exemplary embodiment, the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> fit together at the corresponding cylindrical portions <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and at the center shaft portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the center cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, respectively. Relative rotation around the common rotational axis (which substantially matches, or is substantially parallel to, the rotational axis of the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) of the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, relative movement in a direction parallel to that rotational axis, and relative movement in a direction perpendicular to that rotation axis are all permitted. Relative movement in the direction perpendicular to that rotational axis is permitted by radial clearance between the center shaft portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the center cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> That is, according to this exemplary embodiment, the relative rotation and those two types of relative movement work together, constituting relative displacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes four detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. These four detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are disposed radially and at evenly spaced intervals around the common rotational axis (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;detector axis&rdquo;) of the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As a result, two adjacent detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are spaced 90 degrees apart around the detector axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes a detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> engaged with the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> reduce the rigidity of the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, i.e., help the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to elastically deform easier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is formed so as to have three structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by bending a single, flat steel plate. Of those structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, both the first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> extend parallel to the radial direction of the detector axis. The remaining third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> extends at a right angle with respect to both the first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> All of the structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are shaped so as to function as beams having directionality in a section modulus of the lateral cross-section. According to the exemplary embodiment, they each have a long rectangular cross-section and are plate-shaped, extending straight. As a result, all of the structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> function as members for transmitting force without elastic deformation by bending in one of two directions which are perpendicular to each other on a plane that is orthogonal to a neutral axis of the structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and by not bending in the other direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is engaged with the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is separated from brake friction material, not shown, of a brake, also not shown, that inhibits rotation of the vehicle wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As a result, the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is less prone to effects from heat of the brake friction material. More specifically, the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is engaged with the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by means of the tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which are firmly secured to the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and first and second support members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which are firmly secured to the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. According to this exemplary embodiment, the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is supported by, and so as to be slidable around, the tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, because the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is engaged with the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> using the tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, it is easy to reduce the number of parts of the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as compared with when the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is engaged with the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> using a special engagement member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Further, the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is also engaged with the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is engaged with the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by means of: i) a first transmitting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that extends from the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in a direction perpendicularly crossing the detector axis three-dimensionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, ii) a second transmitting portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that extends from the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> parallel with, but in a position offset from, the detector axis, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and iii) a third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> formed on an outer peripheral portion of the center cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> on the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the first support member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the first transmitting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> make up a longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The above various portions, bolts and member of the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> all work together to enable it to detect longitudinal force acting on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by converting rotation torque T of the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that acts in a direction of a line tangent to a given location on any one circumference around the detector axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when the first transmitting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is pushed against the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, only the second structural member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the first and second structural members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> bends. This bending causes both opposing surfaces of the second structural portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to strain in the direction of its thickness. Strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are attached to both of these surfaces. These strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> detect the strain of each surface and convert it into an electrical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, the pair of strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are used to detect the strain according to the combination of the direction of movement of the vehicle (forward and backward) and the direction of longitudinal force to be detected (driving force and braking force). Both braking force when moving forward and driving force when moving backward generate strain in a first direction in each of the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Conversely, both driving force when moving forward and braking force when moving backward generate strain in a second direction that is opposite the first direction in each of the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the strain gauge <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, in which a tensile strain is generated when driving force as the vehicle moves forward acts on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and when braking force as the vehicle moves backward acts on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, is used only for detecting driving force when the vehicle is moving forward and detecting braking force when the vehicle is moving backward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the strain gauge <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, in which a tensile strain is generated when driving force as the vehicle moves backward acts on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and when braking force as the vehicle moves forward acts on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, is used only for detecting driving force when the vehicle is moving backward and detecting braking force when the vehicle is moving forward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> schematically show a front view and a side sectional view, respectively, of the principle by which the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> detects longitudinal force (which corresponds to rotational moment T). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> denotes a first beam function portion of a detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, which functions as a beam in order to detect longitudinal force of the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This first beam function portion <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is supported at both ends in the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The first beam function portion <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is constructed by coupling together in series: i) a first portion that functions as a beam that resists bending from longitudinal force on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the first portion corresponding to the first structural portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and ii) a second portion that functions as a beam that bends from longitudinal force on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the second portion corresponding to the second structural portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The first support member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> prevents longitudinal force from being transmitted between the first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the first transmitting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is engaged with the first beam function portion <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. As a result, the rotational torque T is converted into the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the first transmitting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The thus converted first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> then acts on the first beam function portion <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in a shearing direction thereof. Accordingly, strain corresponding to the amount of rotational torque T is generated in the first beam function portion <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is also possible to consider the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> with the first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as constituting levers in which: i) the attachment point of the tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the first structural portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is the fulcrum, ii) the contact point between the first transmitting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the first structural portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is the power point, and iii) the attachment point of the first support member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the second structural portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is the point of application. According to this principle of leverage, strain is generated in the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> which has been reduced in proportion to the amount of the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> schematically shows this principle of leverage. In the figure, reference numeral L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes the distance between the fulcrum and the point of application, reference numeral L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes the distance between the fulcrum and the power point, and reference numeral R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a first reaction force generated at the point of application against the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Considering equilibrium of the moment around the fulcrum, in this lever the first reaction force R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is obtained as </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight>1&equals;<highlight><italic>F</italic></highlight>1&times;(<highlight><italic>L</italic></highlight>2/<highlight><italic>L</italic></highlight>1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Because the value of (L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), which represents the lever ratio, is less than 1, the reaction force R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is less than the first reaction force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As a result, the bending moment acting on the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is prevented from increasing such that the strain generated in the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is also prevented from increasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Further, according to this exemplary embodiment, the first structural portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the second structural portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are able to be coupled together in series by being integrally formed together. This coupling together in series is also possible by forming the first structural portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the second structural portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> independently of one another and then engaging them to each other in series. This is also possible for the lateral force detecting portion, which will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to this exemplary embodiment, a preload from the coil spring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is applied between the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a preload is also applied to the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and a strain gauge for detecting lateral force, to be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> That is, according to this exemplary embodiment, the coil spring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is one example of the mechanism that applies the preload. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> In this way, as a result of applying the preload, play between the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is suppressed. Further, when the output signal from the strain gauge for detecting lateral force is 0, it is possible that there may be determined to be some sort of abnormality in a part (a mechanical or electrical part) relating to the detection of lateral force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is an arrangement like <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, except that structural portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is separate from (i.e., not integral with) portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the strain gauges are provided on a single side of the structural portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, rather than on both sides thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, the construction, in principle, of the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that is within each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and which is for detecting longitudinal force on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has been described. Next, the construction, in principle, of the lateral force detecting portion that detects lateral force SF on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, similar to the lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the first support member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a second transmitting portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> make up a lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The above various portions, bolts and member of the lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> all work together to enable it to detect lateral force SF acting on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the second transmitting portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is pushed against the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, only the first structural member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the first and second structural members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> bends. This bending causes both opposing surfaces of the first structural portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to strain in the direction of its thickness. Strain gauges <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are attached to both of these surfaces. These strain gauges <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> detect the strain of each surface and convert it into an electrical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, this pair of strain gauges <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is used to detect when lateral force SF on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is acting toward the outside of a turn (to the left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), with respect to when it is acting toward the inside of a turn (to the right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The strain gauge <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, in which tensile strain is generated when lateral force acts toward the outside, is used to detect lateral force SF only when that lateral force acts toward the outside. Conversely, the strain gauge <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, in which tensile strain is generated when lateral force acts toward the inside, is used to detect lateral force SF only when that lateral force acts toward the inside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> schematically shows a side sectional view of the principle by which the lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> detects lateral force SF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> denotes the second beam function portion that is within the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and which functions as a beam for detecting lateral force SF. This second beam function portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is supported at both ends in the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The second beam function portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is constructed by coupling together in series i) a first portion that functions as a beam that bends from lateral force SF, the first portion corresponding to the first structural portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and ii) a second portion that functions as a beam that resists bending from lateral force SF, the second portion corresponding to the second structural portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The first support member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> prevents lateral force SF from being transmitted between the first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the second transmitting portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is engaged with the second beam function portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. As a result, a second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> based on the lateral force SF acts on the second beam function portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in a shearing direction thereof from the second transmitting portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, strain corresponding to the amount of lateral force SF is generated in the second beam function portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, similar to the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, it is also possible to consider the lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with the first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as constituting levers. These levers are constructed such that: i) the attachment point of the tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the first structural portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is the fulcrum, ii) the contact point between the second transmitting portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the first structural portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is the power point, and iii) the attachment point of the first support member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the second structural portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is the point of application. According to this principle of leverage, strain is generated in the strain gauges <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> which has been reduced in proportion to the amount of the second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Next, the construction, in principle, of the vertical force detecting portion that is within each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and which is for detecting a vertical force VF on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the first and second support members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> make up a vertical force detecting portion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>). The above various portions and members of the vertical force detecting portion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> all work together to enable it to detect vertical force VF. The first support member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> prevents vertical force from being transmitted between the first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is pushed against the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, only the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> bends. This bending causes both opposing surfaces of the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to strain in the direction of its thickness. A strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is attached to a surface of the third structural portion that is opposite the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. This strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> converts the strain of that surface into an electrical signal. That is, the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is attached to a surface of the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in which tensile strain is generated by bending of the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> as a result of it being pushed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Further, according to this exemplary embodiment, the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is formed so as to have three structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by bending a single, flat steel plate, as described above. Furthermore, a plurality of strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is attached to each surface of the three structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, it is possible to attach a plurality of strain gauges at selected locations on the surface of each flat plate before bending the flat plates, and then bending the flat plates with a pressing machine or the like to complete the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> However, according to this exemplary embodiment, both the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the lateral force detecting member <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are constructed such that each of the transmitting portions <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> have two opposing portions which sandwich the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Those two portions transmit force to the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in respectively opposite directions. However, each portion only transmits force to the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in a single direction, which is the direction of compression. Therefore, compression force is generated when the portions push against the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, but no tensile force is generated when the portions are separated from detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> In contrast, according to this exemplary embodiment, the vertical force detecting portion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is constructed such that the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> thereof has only one portion that only transmits force to the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in one direction, which is the direction of compression. The four detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are made up of two pairs of two detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, with the two detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in each pair opposing one another across the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, even if each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to only detect compression force, by relying on the two detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> that make up each pair, even if the direction in which the vertical force VF acts on the two detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> changes, one of the two detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will detect the vertical force VF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> While the vehicle is running, the rotational position of each of the four detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> around the detector axis changes because the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rotates together with the hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As a result, longitudinal force and lateral force are generated in each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at all rotational positions, while vertical force is only generated in each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at a limited number of rotational positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> With regard to vertical force, more specifically, when only vertical force is transmitted from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is able to detect vertical force only at a plurality of rotational positions within a range from 90 degrees in the clockwise direction to 90 degrees in the counterclockwise direction from a straight line in which the vertical force from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In contrast, as described above, when the resultant force of vertical force and longitudinal force from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is able to detect the resultant force only at a plurality of rotational positions within a range from 90 degrees in the clockwise direction to 90 degrees in the counterclockwise direction from a straight line (a straight line that is slanted with respect to a straight line extending straight down from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>) in which the resultant force from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> schematically show a front view and a side sectional view, respectively, of the principle by which the vertical force detecting portion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> detects vertical force VF. In these figures, reference numeral <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> denotes a third beam function portion that functions as a beam for detecting vertical force VF in the detecting portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The third beam function portion <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is supported at both ends by the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The third beam function portion <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> has a portion that functions as a beam that bends when vertical force VF is applied, which corresponds to the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is engaged with the third beam function portion <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. As a result, vertical force VF from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> acts on the third beam function portion <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in the shearing direction thereof from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, strain is generated in the third beam function portion <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in accordance with the amount of vertical force VF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Similar to the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is also possible to consider of the vertical force detecting portion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> with the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as constituting a lever. This lever is constructed such that: i) the attachment point of the first support member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is the fulcrum, ii) the contact point between the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is the power point, and iii) the attachment point of the second support member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is the point of application. According to this principle of leverage, strain is generated in the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> which has been reduced in proportion to the amount of the vertical force VF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the explanation above, according to this exemplary embodiment, the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and the vertical force detecting portion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are all designed such that strain, which has been mechanically reduced in proportion to the amount of load transmitted from each transmitting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, is generated in each of the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, which serve as detecting elements. As a result, the load capacity that each of the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> must withstand is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> That is, according to this exemplary embodiment, the lever formed by the detecting element <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> itself constitutes an example of the reducing mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, a limiting function further reduces the load capacity of each strain gauge <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. In this exemplary embodiment, this limiting mechanism is provided for the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first limiting mechanism <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> for the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to include a pair of stoppers <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> near the tire mounting bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. One of the stoppers <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> functions when the vehicle moves forward. The other stopper <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> functions when the vehicle moves backward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Before the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is transmitted from the first transmitting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, exceeds a set limit, there is a clearance in the circumferential direction of the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> between each stopper <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. As the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> approaches the set limit, however, that clearance is reduced until the set limit is reached and there is no more clearance. When there is no more clearance, but the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is still being applied, that force is transmitted from the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through one of the two stoppers <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, whichever corresponds, and the tire mounting bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As a result, the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmitted to the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> does not increase past the set limit. That is, the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> increases in accordance with the rotational torque T when it is below the set limit, but if the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reaches the set limit, it is kept there. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> A second limiting mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for the lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to include a pair of stoppers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> near the tire mounting bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. One of the stoppers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> functions when lateral force acts on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the direction of the outside of the turn. The other stopper <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> functions when lateral force acts on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the direction of the inside of the turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Before the lateral force SF, which is transmitted from the second transmitting portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, exceeds a set limit, there is a clearance in the direction parallel to the detector axis between each stopper <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. As the lateral force SF approaches the set limit, however, that clearance is reduced until the set limit is reached and there is no more clearance. When there is no more clearance, but lateral force SF is still being applied, that force is transmitted from the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through one of the two stoppers <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, whichever corresponds, to the first partition housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As a result, the second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmitted to the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> does not increase past the set limit. That is, the second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> matches the lateral force SF when it is below the set limit, but if the second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> reaches the set limit, it is kept there. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the explanation above, according to this exemplary embodiment, the first and second limiting mechanisms <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> both constitute examples of the limiting mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> Further, the stopper <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> ultimately also functions to prevent the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from separating from one another beyond a set limit in a direction parallel to the detector axis, i.e., in the lateral direction of the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a graph showing a relationship between: i) input loads to the detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which are the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> having a limiting mechanism and the second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> also having a limiting mechanism, and ii) strain generated in the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> in accordance with those input loads. A comparative example in which the limiting mechanisms are not provided is also shown in the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> When designing the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in order to allow a margin for safety for the load that is predicted to be generated when actually used, the design permissible value is generally set larger than the predicted load, similar to other ordinary devices. Also, the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is designed to clear that set design permissible value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> When the limiting mechanisms are not provided, the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are used so that strain therein does not exceed its maximum range width when the input load matches the design permissible value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Conversely, when the limiting mechanisms are provided, because the input load will not exceed the set limit, which is smaller than the design permissible value, the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> can be used so that strain thereof does not exceed its maximum range width when the input load matches that set limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> Therefore according to this exemplary embodiment, the gradient of the graph in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is steeper when limiting mechanisms are provided for detecting longitudinal force and lateral force as compared to when they are not, which means that the detection sensitivity of the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> to longitudinal force and lateral force is very high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Heretofore the mechanical configuration of the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was described. Next, the electrical configuration of the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a block view schematically showing the electrical configuration of the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, The strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> are connected to a signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. This signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is connected to a transmitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The signal processing <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> picks out electrical signals indicative of the strain generated in the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and supplies them to the transmitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> then transmits the supplied electrical signals as electrical waves. The signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the transmitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> operate with power supplied from a power source <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> provided in the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The power source <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be a consumption type which can not be recharged while in use, such as a direct current battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a block diagram that also schematically shows electrical equipment mounted on the vehicle body side of the vehicle. A receiver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is mounted on the vehicle body side in a position near the transmitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. A vehicle control unit <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is connected to the receiver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> via a signal processing unit <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Signals sent from the transmitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are received by the receiver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and supplied to the signal processing unit <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The signal processing unit <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> then carries out the necessary processing of these signals and then supplies the processed signals to the vehicle control unit <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The vehicle control unit <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to include an actuator, not shown, for controlling the state of the vehicle, and a controller, also not shown, for driving the actuator as well as for controlling the driving state of the actuator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> The signal processing unit <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> includes a calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for calculating longitudinal force, lateral force and vertical force based on output signals from the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. That is, according to this exemplary embodiment, the entire device for detecting force acting on a tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is made up of a detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided between the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the receiver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provided on the vehicle body side. The above detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the receiver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and the calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> all work together to enable the device to detect force acting on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, the calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provided on the vehicle body side calculates force acting on the tire based on the output signals from the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, regardless of whether the force acting on the tire to be detected is longitudinal force, lateral force, or vertical force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> As described previously, longitudinal force and lateral force are generated in each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at all rotational positions, while vertical force is only generated in each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at a limited number of rotational positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a graph showing, with a plurality of individual curves, the change in an output signal from each strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> in the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the four detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> positioned in four rotational locations at 90 degree intervals, along with the change in rotation angle of the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the size of the component of the vertical force VF acting at a right angle to each strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> changes cyclically in accordance with the rotational position of each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, i.e., in accordance with the rotation angle of the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, regardless of the fact that the amount of actual vertical force VF does not change over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> This cyclic change appears as a cyclic change in the output signal of each strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a graph in which the virtual output signal corresponding to the actual vertical force VF is a horizontal, straight line. As is evident from the graph in this figure, the output signal of each strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is indicated by a single curve expressed with an upwardly convex sine wave for each cycle, i.e., for every one rotation of the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The maximum value in each individual curve matches the virtual output signal corresponding to the actual vertical force VF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, any two adjacent detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are positioned at 90 degrees from one another around the detector axis. As a result, any two adjacent third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> together form a right angle as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The cylindrical surface of the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> contacts both of the two third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when vertical force VF acts straight down from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and one of the two third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is positioned directly below the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, force from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is transmitted only to that third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. However, as that third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is rotated from the position directly below the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> also transmits force to the other third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In this state, the actual vertical force VF is distributed to the two third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Then, if force transmitted in a perpendicular direction from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the surface of each third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is expressed as component forces f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, then the actual vertical force VF is expressed by the square root of the square of sums of component force f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and component force f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, when force is being transmitted from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the two third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, force is not being transmitted from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the remaining two of the four third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. However, as rotation continues, force is transmitted from the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to one of the first two third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and an adjacent one of the remaining two third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, just as it was with the first two third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the fact that this type of shift in the force transmitting state is repeated as the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates, vertical force VF can ultimately be calculated without relying on the rotational position of the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by using the square root of the sum of squares of the output signal from each strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> of the four detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, according to this exemplary embodiment, both longitudinal force and vertical force act on the second partition housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As a result, when both of those forces are also acting on the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, they are transmitted through the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Not only vertical force but also longitudinal force is ultimately transmitted to the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> because while the direction of lateral force does not contribute to the bending of the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the direction of longitudinal force and vertical force does contribute to the bending of the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, resultant force RF of the longitudinal force LF and the vertical force VF acts on each of the third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. As a result, the output signal from the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> of the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> ultimately indicates the resultant force RF, not the vertical force VF. That is, the output signal ultimately includes not only the component that reflects vertical force, but also the component which reflects longitudinal force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, the component that reflects longitudinal force is eliminated from the output signal of the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> of the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> first calculates the square of the resultant force of the longitudinal force and the vertical force based on the raw output signal from the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> of each of the third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the four detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. This calculation is performed using the sum of squares of the output signals of the four strain gauges <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, as described above. Next, the calculation portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> calculates the longitudinal force based on the output signals from the strain gauges <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the second structural portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Then, the calculation portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> calculates from the square of the calculated resultant force the vertical force as the square root of a value from which the square of the calculated longitudinal force was subtracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Further, according to this exemplary embodiment, the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is constructed such that the first through third structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed integrally together. However, the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> can also be constructed such that one of those structural portions can be separated from the remaining two structural portions. This embodiment makes it easy to prevent a specific type of force acting on the tire from being transmitted between the two separated portions, for example. Then, for example, the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is selected for one structural portion and the first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are selected for the remaining two structural portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> Next a second embodiment of the invention will be described. This exemplary embodiment has many elements that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment. The only element that is different relates to the construction for applying the preload to the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Therefore, only this element will be described in detail. Elements in the second exemplary embodiment that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment are referred to by the same terminology and reference numerals as in the first exemplary embodiment, and explanations thereof will therefore be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> According to the first exemplary embodiment, the preload is applied to the strain gauges <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> for detecting lateral force by the coil spring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, as described above. In the second exemplary embodiment, however, the preload is also applied to the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> for detecting vertical force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> According to the second exemplary embodiment, the relative position of the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> for detecting vertical force and the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is regulated such that the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> presses against the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> even when the vertical force is 0, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> applies the preload to the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> because of this type of regulated relative position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Further, according to this exemplary embodiment, the amount of that applied preload can be adjusted by the manufacturer when the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is being assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> In order to apply these technologies, in this exemplary embodiment, a third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> having a completely cylindrical surface that is engaged with the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is arranged eccentrically with respect to the detector axis, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can rotate around the detector axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, the amount of preload applied to the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> thereof is able to be adjusted by adjusting the rotation angle of the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> around the detector axis, regardless of any variations that occur during manufacturing of the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the third structural portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, the four third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are disposed around the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. It is preferable that preload applied to any of the structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> be adjustable by the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, an engaging surface of any one of the third transmitting portions <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> that is engaged with the four third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed by combining four partially cylindrical surface of the same diameter that are offset by the same amount in different directions at 90 degree intervals with respect to the detector axis, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. When the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> which has this type of engaging surface is rotated around the detector axis, the preload applied to all of the third structural portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the strain gauges <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> thereof changes simultaneously by the same amount in the same direction in accordance with that rotation angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> That is, according to the exemplary embodiment, the third transmitting portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is an example of the preload applying mechanism, and is also an example of the position regulating mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Next, a third exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described. This exemplary embodiment has many elements that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment. The only elements that are different relate to the construction of the longitudinal force detecting portion and the lateral force detecting portion. Therefore, only these elements will be described in detail. Elements in the third exemplary embodiment that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment are referred to by the same terminology and reference numerals as in the first exemplary embodiment, and explanations thereof will therefore be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> In the first exemplary embodiment, the longitudinal force detecting portion <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is designed so as to use different strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> when driving force is applied to the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> while the vehicle is moving forward or when braking force is applied to the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> while the vehicle is moving backward, than when braking force is applied to the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> while the vehicle is moving forward or when driving force is applied to the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> while the vehicle is moving backward, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the first exemplary embodiment, the lateral force detecting portion <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is designed so as to use different strain gauges <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> when lateral force is applied to the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward the outside of the turn, than when lateral force is applied to the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward the inside of the turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the first exemplary embodiment, the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are mounted on both sides of the first and second structural portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> In contrast, according to the third exemplary embodiment, a strain gauge <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> for detecting longitudinal force, a strain gauge <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> for detecting lateral force, and the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> for detecting vertical force are mounted on one side of the flat plate of each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> before that flat plate is bent to form the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Also according to this exemplary embodiment, it is presumed that each of the strain gauges <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> detects the necessary force acting on the tire based on tensile strain generated in each of those strain gauges, just as in the first exemplary embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in the chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, in this exemplary embodiment the detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>: i) detects driving force when the vehicle is moving forward, ii) detects braking force when the vehicle is moving backward, and iii) detects lateral force when lateral force is acting on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward the outside of the turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> The detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled B is disposed in a position offset 90 degrees from the detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled A in the direction opposite forward rotation. The detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled B: i) detects driving force when the vehicle is moving backward, ii) detects braking force when the vehicle is moving forward, and iii) detects lateral force when lateral force is acting on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward the inside of the turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled C is disposed in a position offset 90 degrees from the detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled B in the direction opposite forward rotation. The detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled C: i) detects driving force when the vehicle is moving forward, ii) detects braking force when the vehicle is moving backward, and iii) detects lateral force when lateral force is acting on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward the outside of the turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> The detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled D is disposed in a position offset 90 degrees from the detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled C in the direction opposite forward rotation. The detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled D: i) detects driving force when the vehicle is moving backward, ii) detects braking force when the vehicle is moving forward, and iii) detects lateral force when lateral force is acting on the tire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward the inside of the turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> Next a fourth exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described. This exemplary embodiment has many elements that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment. The only element that is different relates to the construction of the detecting portion. Therefore, only this element will be described in detail. Elements in the fourth exemplary embodiment that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment are referred to by the same terminology and reference numerals as in the first exemplary embodiment, and explanations thereof will therefore be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> In the first exemplary embodiment, the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, formed as an independent member, is mounted to the two partition housings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> not in a rigid state, but in a state permitting relative movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> In contrast, according to the fourth exemplary embodiment, a detecting member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> in each detecting portion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is mounted in two partition housings <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> and is a rigid state within a detector <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight>, as shown schematically in the perspective view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. In this figure, however, only two of the four detecting portions <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> disposed at evenly spaced intervals around the detector axis are shown representatively. The first partition housing <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> is mounted to a disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, not shown, with a tire mounting bolt <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. The second partition housing <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> is mounted to the hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, not shown, with a hub mounting bolt, also not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, each detecting member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> is fastened to the two partition housings <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> with two bolts which serve as fastening means. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, an oval drawn within each detecting member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> represents a through-hole <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> in each detecting member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> through which the two bolts pass. One of the two bolts is a tire mounting bolt <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> which is used to both attach the detector <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> to the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and attach each detecting member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> to the first partition housing <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> The detecting member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> is less rigid than the two partition housings <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. As a result, relative displacement of the two partition housings <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> is permitted by elastic deformation of the detecting member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> A strain gauge <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> for detecting longitudinal force, a strain gauge <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> for detecting lateral force, and a strain gauge <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> for detecting vertical force are mounted to only one surface of the detecting member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>, just as in the third exemplary embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21, a</cross-reference> pair of stoppers <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> which sandwich the first partition housing <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> from both sides is provided on the second partition housing <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. This pair of stoppers <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> selectively abut against a corresponding one of two surfaces of the first partition housing <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight>. This abutting prevents the second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>) from the two partition housings <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> which acts in both directions parallel to the detector axis, from exceeding a set limit and acting on the detecting members <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Further, the stopper <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> also serves to prevent the first partition housing <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> from separating from the second partition housing <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> on the same axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Next a fifth exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described. This exemplary embodiment has many elements that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment. The only element that is different relates to the arrangement of the detecting portion. Therefore, only this element will be described in detail. Elements in the fifth exemplary embodiment that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment are referred to by the same terminology and reference numerals as in the first exemplary embodiment, and explanations thereof will therefore be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> In the first exemplary embodiment, there are four of the detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. According to the fifth exemplary embodiment, however, there are only two. In the detector according to this exemplary embodiment, the two detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are the detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> With respect to detection of longitudinal force and lateral force, even when there are less than four detecting portions, output signals from each of the strain gauges <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> reflect longitudinal force and lateral force, respectively, regardless of the rotation angle of the detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> In contrast, with respect to vertical force, when there are less than four detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the output signals from the strain gauges <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> change cyclically as the rotation angle of the detector changes, even when the amount of actual vertical force does not change over time. Furthermore, for each strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, there is a rotational position at which the output signals from the strain gauges <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> do not reflect the amount of actual vertical force at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a graph showing, with a plurality of individual curves, the change in an output signal from each strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> in the two detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> along with the change in rotation angle of the detector when the amount of actual vertical force does not change over time. In each individual curve, the maximum value faithfully reflects the amount of actual vertical force, as described above. When the rotation angle of the detector that corresponds to the maximum value in any one individual curve is set at 0 degrees, the output signal from the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> in each detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will be 0 at two rotational positions in which relative rotation angles that express a distance from that 0 degree rotation angle are 90 degrees and 270 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, the calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provided on the vehicle body side sequentially calculates vertical force based on each output signal from the two strain gauges <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> for detecting vertical force, while taking the above characteristics into consideration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> calculates vertical force as temporary vertical force, just as in the first exemplary embodiment, based on the output signals from each strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> for every calculation cycle. Next, the calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> corrects the calculated temporary vertical force using the relative rotation angle &thgr; in that calculation cycle to obtain the final vertical force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> The temporary vertical force can be corrected as follows, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> When the correction is performed based on the detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled A, the rotational position of the detector when the output signal from the strain gauge <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> of that reference detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> indicates the maximum value is set as the reference rotational position. The relative rotation angle &thgr; is calculated from that reference rotational position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> A vehicle wheel rotation angle sensor, not shown, for detecting the relative rotation angle &thgr; of each vehicle wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is also mounted in a vehicle that is equipped with the device for detecting force acting on a tire according to this exemplary embodiment. According to this exemplary embodiment, the relative rotation angle &thgr; is then calculated based on the output signal from that vehicle wheel rotation angle sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the calculated relative rotation angle &thgr; is greater than 0 degrees but less than 90 degrees and the temporary vertical force obtained by the detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled A is denoted as PVA and the final vertical force is denoted as FV, the temporary vertical force PVA can be corrected with a calculation according to Expression 1 below. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>FV&equals;PVA/</italic></highlight>COS &thgr;&emsp;&emsp;Expression 1: </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> When the relative rotation angle &thgr; is greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees and the temporary vertical force obtained by the detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> labeled C is denoted as PVC, the temporary vertical force PVC can be corrected with a calculation according to Expression 2 below. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>FV&equals;PVC/</italic></highlight>COS &thgr;&emsp;&emsp;Expression 2: </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> When the relative rotation angle &thgr; is greater than 180 degrees but less than 270 degrees, the temporary vertical force PVC can still be corrected with a calculation according to Expression 2 above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> When the relative rotation angle &thgr; is greater than 270 degrees but less than 360 degrees, the temporary vertical force PVA can be corrected with a calculation according to Expression 1 above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> However, when the relative rotation angle &thgr; is 0 degrees, the temporary vertical force PVA is calculated as it is as the final vertical force FV, and when the relative rotation angle &thgr; is 180 degrees, the temporary vertical force PVC is calculated as it is as the final vertical force FV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the relative rotation angle &thgr; is 90 degrees or 270 degrees, the temporary vertical force PVA at that time is 0 and correction by dividing by COS&thgr; is not possible. Therefore in this case, calculation of the final vertical force FV is not actually performed and the final vertical force FV calculated near 90 degrees or 270 degrees, for example, is used instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> Moreover according to this exemplary embodiment, the final vertical force FV is obtained also at a relative rotation angle &thgr; other than the relative rotation angle &thgr; that indicates the temporary vertical forces PVA and PVC as the maximum values. However, this invention can also be carried out according to an embodiment in which the final vertical force FV is obtained only at the relative rotation angle &thgr; that indicates the temporary vertical forces PVA and PVC as the maximum values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment of the invention, there are cases where it is necessary to obtain the final vertical force as the maximum value of the temporary vertical force by relating the output signals from each of the strain gauges <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> for every cycle. In these cases, when a new cycle starts each time the output signal changes from 0 to a value other than 0, for example, it is possible to obtain the final vertical force as the maximum force of a temporary vertical force in a given cycle in a period from when the maximum value of the temporary vertical force is obtained in that cycle until that same cycle ends. In this case, it is possible to make the final vertical force obtained in the most recent cycle invalid as the next cycle starts. It is also possible to make the final vertical force obtained in the most recent cycle valid until the temporary vertical force in the current cycle becomes the maximum value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a method for calculating vertical force when there are two detecting portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> was described above. However, the invention can also be carried out when there is only one detecting portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> by calculating vertical force according to a method based on the aforementioned method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> Next a sixth exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described. Elements in the sixth exemplary embodiment that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment are referred to by the same terminology and reference numerals as in the first exemplary embodiment so detailed explanations thereof will therefore be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> The following points of the device for detecting force acting on a tire according to the sixth exemplary embodiment are the same as those for the first exemplary embodiment: i) the detector can be detachably mounted between the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a state in which force is being transmitted therebetween, ii) the detector and the calculating portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is able to communicate wirelessly are provided on the vehicle body side, and iii) the detecting portion which has a detecting element is disposed in an interior space enclosed by the two partition housings that fit together so as to be relatively displaceable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> However, the device for detecting force acting on a tire according to the sixth exemplary embodiment differs from the device of the first exemplary embodiment in that the device according to the sixth exemplary embodiment only detects longitudinal force and lateral force, while the device according the first exemplary embodiment detects not only longitudinal force and lateral force, but also vertical force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> Further, the device for detecting force acting on a tire according to the sixth exemplary embodiment also differs from the device of the first exemplary embodiment in that the device according to the sixth exemplary embodiment transmits rotational torque T between the two partition housings to the detecting element through a combination of a gear mechanism and a screw mechanism connected together in series, while the device according the first exemplary embodiment transmits rotational torque T between the two partition housings to the detecting element using a detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which functions as a beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the device for detecting force acting on a tire according to the sixth exemplary embodiment also differs from the device of the first exemplary embodiment in that the device according to the sixth exemplary embodiment directly detects lateral force SF between the two partition housings, while the device according the first exemplary embodiment indirectly detects lateral force SF between the two partition housings through the detecting member <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which functions as a beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, in a detector <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> according to this exemplary embodiment, a plurality of tire mounting bolts <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> extend out from a first housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> toward the disc wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, not shown. The hub <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, not shown, is mounted to a second partition housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> by a plurality of hub mounting bolts, also not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> The two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are able to rotate relatively around, as well as move relatively in a direction parallel with, the detector axis. Rotational torque T is detected using this relative rotation and lateral force SF is detected using this relative movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> A support member <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> is mounted to the second partition housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> in a fixed position behind the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is supported by the support member <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> so as to be able to rotate around the detector axis. The first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is prevented from separating from the second partition housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> by the support member <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> Conversely, a plurality of balls <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, which serve as rolling elements, are provided between the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the second partition housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> so as to prevent the partition housings from contacting one another. Rotation of these balls <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> enables the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the second partition housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to rotate smoothly relative to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, as opposed to the first exemplary embodiment, a cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> of the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> has a smaller diameter than a cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> of the second partition housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Therefore, an inside surface of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> of the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> faces the center portion of the second partition housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. The second partition housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> has an integrated protruding portion <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> in a position facing the inside surface of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> of the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> A screw mechanism <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is provided between, and on the same axis as, the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. This screw mechanism <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is constructed such that a shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> screws into a nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> is arranged on the same axis as the detector <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> A bearing <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> is provided between each end of the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> and the partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, and is on the same axis as the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, such that the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is permitted to rotate smoothly relative to the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> The dimensions of the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> in the axial direction are set shorter than the distance between bottom portions <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> of the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> are disposed between each end portion of the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and each partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, respectively. Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, each of the end portions of the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> abuts against one of the piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> which in turn abuts against one of the partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. As a result, lateral force SF is able to be detected by the piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, however, when lateral force SF is generated, a portion of that lateral force SF acts on the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and the piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> when the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are relatively close to one another because the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are in contact with one another through the balls <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, a portion of that lateral force SF still acts on the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and the piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> even when the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are relatively distanced from one another because the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are engaged with one another via the support member <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, when the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is rotated in one direction, the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> moves in one direction such that one of the two piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, whichever is positioned in front of that shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, is compressed. That piezoelectric element then outputs a voltage of an amount in accordance with that compression strain in the form of an electrical signal. At this time, no tensile force acts on the piezoelectric element, of the two piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, that is positioned behind the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> According to the exemplary embodiment, a gear mechanism <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is used for transmitting rotation torque T between the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. The gear mechanism <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> has a construction similar to that of a planetary gear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the gear mechanism includes an input gear <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, a middle gear <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, and an output gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> together in series. The input gear <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> is formed as a ring gear on an outside surface of the protruding portion <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> of the second partition housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and is on the same axis as the second partition housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. The middle gear <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is a cylindrical gear that meshes with the input gear <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> An outer gear <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> is formed as a ring gear on the inside surface of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> of the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and is on the same axis as the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The middle gear <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> meshes with this outer gear <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> as well as with the input gear <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. A plurality of these middle gears <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> are disposed at evenly spaced intervals around the detector axis. Relative rotation of the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> produces relative displacement between the input gear <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and the outer gear <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight>. This relative displacement causes each of the middle gears <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> to rotate around their own axes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> One output gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is fixed to each of the middle gears <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> such that the output gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> revolves around the same axis as the axis around which the middle gear <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> rotates. According to this exemplary embodiment, one middle gear <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> and one output gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> are integrally formed together as a single member. The output gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is arm-shaped and extends from the middle gear <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> toward the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. Tooth planes are formed on tip portions of the output gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> and the output gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> meshes with the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> at these tooth planes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, the detector <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> on a whole is such that a plurality of output gears <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight>, each formed in an arm-like shape, extends radially outward at evenly spaced intervals from the detector axis. The screw mechanism <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is then supported in a central location with respect to the plurality of output gears <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> by meshing therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in this gear mechanism <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, if relative rotation is produced between the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, the middle gears <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> rotate accordingly and the output gears <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> slide at the same angle as the middle gears <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>. The nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> then rotates in accordance with that sliding angle and the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> moves in accordance with that rotation angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, not only the second axial force based on the lateral force SF but also the first axial force based on the rotational torque T is affected by the same shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the voltage generated in the piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> is only referenced, those two types of forces acting on the tire are not able to be separated and detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> However, according to this exemplary embodiment, compression force is transmitted from the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> to each piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> but tensile force is not. Therefore, a vector sum of the second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> based on the lateral force SF and the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> based on the rotational torque T acts on the piezoelectric element, of the two piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, positioned on the front side in the direction in which the second axial force based on the lateral force SF acts. In contrast, only the second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> based on the lateral force SF acts on the piezoelectric element, of the two piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, positioned on the rear side in the direction in which the second axial force based on the lateral force SF acts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> Then according to this exemplary embodiment, by focusing on this kind of phenomenon, the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is calculated by subtracting the axial force converted from the output voltage of the rear side piezoelectric element from the axial force converted from the output voltage of the front side piezoelectric element. Also, the second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is calculated as axial force converted from the output voltage of the rear side piezoelectric element. The determination of which one of the two piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> is the front side piezoelectric element and which one is the rear side piezoelectric element can be made, for example, by noting the fact that the larger of the axial forces converted from the output signals of the respective piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, respectively, is indicated by the output signal from the front side piezoelectric element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> That is, according to this exemplary embodiment, the first axial force F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is calculated by removing the component of the second axial force F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the axial force converted from the output voltage of the front side piezoelectric element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, it is possible to separate the first and second axial forces F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from each other and detect them by using the characteristics of the transmission state of force between the two piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> In this case, the relationship between the rotational torque T between the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and rotational torque Q of the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is investigated. The radius of the input gear <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> is denoted as R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the radius of the middle gear <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is denoted as R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the radius of the output gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is denoted as R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the radius of the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is denoted as R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> When considering that the amount of tangential force at the point where the gear pairs mesh is equal, and the rotational torque of the middle gear <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> between the input gear <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and the middle gear <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is denoted as S, then the following Expression 3 is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T/R</italic></highlight>1&equals;<highlight><italic>S/R</italic></highlight>2&emsp;&emsp;Expression 3: </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> In addition, if the rotational torque of the middle gear <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> between the output gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> and the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is denoted as S, then the following Expression 4 is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>S/R</italic></highlight>3&equals;<highlight><italic>Q/R</italic></highlight>4&emsp;&emsp;Expression 4: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the rotational torque Q of the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is expressed with Expression 5 below. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Q&equals;T</italic></highlight>&times;(<highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight>2/<highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight>1)&times;(<highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight>4/<highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight>3)&emsp;&emsp;Expression 5: </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> Here, because the quotient of R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the quotient of R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>/R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, are both less then 1, the rotational torque Q is less than the rotational torque T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the gear mechanism <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> can be made so as to reduce the rotational torque T between the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> by increasing the relative rotational movement of the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> two gear speeds, and then transmit that reduced rotational torque T to the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to this exemplary embodiment, the rotational torque T is reduced and transmitted to the nut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> by the gear mechanism <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. As a result, according to this exemplary embodiment, it is easy to design the detector <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> so that the load capacity that the screw mechanism <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> must withstand is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> Further, reducing the rotational torque Q also tends to reduce the axial force transmitted from the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> to the piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. As a result, according to this exemplary embodiment, it is easy to design the detector <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> so that the load capacity that the piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> must withstand is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, a preload is applied between the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> so as to press them toward one another. Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, a preload applying mechanism <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> is mounted on the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. This preload applying mechanism <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> includes a pressing element <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> on the same axis as the detector <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, which presses the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> from behind. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> The position of the pressing element <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> is regulated in the axial direction by a holder <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> mounted on the support member <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. The relative positions of the pressing element <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> and the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the axial direction are adjustable with holder <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the holder <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> is mounted to the support member <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> by a male screw, formed on the holder <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>, and a female screw, formed on the support member <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, screwing together. If a worker changes the amount that the holder <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> is screwed into the support member <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, the relative position of the pressing element <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> with respect to the first partition housing <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> changes in the axial direction such that the amount of preload between the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> Next, a seventh exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described. This exemplary embodiment has many elements that are the same as those in the sixth exemplary embodiment. The only element that is different relates to the shape of the detecting element. Therefore, only this element will be described in detail. Elements in the seventh exemplary embodiment that are the same as those in the sixth exemplary embodiment are referred to by the same terminology and reference numerals as in the sixth exemplary embodiment, and explanations thereof will therefore be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> According the sixth exemplary embodiment, the piezoelectric elements <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> are used as the detecting elements. However, in the seventh exemplary embodiment, a plurality of strain gauges <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> are used as the detecting elements, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, detecting members <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> are provided in front of and in back of the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, respectively, in order to detect strain generated in accordance with outside force. Each detecting member <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is less rigid than the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Each detecting member <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the end portions of the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and the two partition housings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. One of the strain gauges <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is mounted on each of the detecting members <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to this exemplary embodiment, when the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> is moved in one direction, a compression force is generated on one of the two detecting members <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> so that it bends. As a result, strain is generated in one of the strain gauges <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> that are tightly adhered to the detecting members <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. At this time, no tensile force is transmitted to the other one of the two detecting members <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> from the shaft <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. This point in this exemplary embodiment is the same as in the sixth exemplary embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Next, an eighth exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described. This exemplary embodiment has many elements that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment. The only element that is different relates to the power source. Therefore, only this element will be described in detail. Elements in the second exemplary embodiment that are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment are referred to by the same terminology and reference numerals as in the first exemplary embodiment, and explanations thereof will therefore be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> According to the first exemplary embodiment, the power source <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is a consumption type power source as described above. Therefore, after the power source <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> has been consumed, it is necessary to replace it with a yet unused power source or recharge it from the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> shows a side view of a detector <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the device for detecting force acting on a tire according to the eighth exemplary embodiment. This detector <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is the same as the detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> except in that it is hollow at its axis.
