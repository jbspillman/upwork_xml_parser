<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In office works, operator tears, cuts, rolls and folds up sheets and puts the folded sheets into envelopes to mail them, or just simply folds up the sheet to mail them. This only can process a small amount of mails. If there are a large amount of mails to process, it will take too much time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Some workplaces have to process a large amount of documents to mail, such as power bills, water bills and traffic tickets etc. At this time, they just simply fold up the sheets to hide the information inside and leave the address and the name of the receiver at outside. Then, operator seals the folded sheets by stickers or seals it by paste. Thus, the sheets are ready to mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> I found the sealing procedure is totally operated by labors in the prior art that takes much time and takes a higher cost. </paragraph>

The limiting members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are to guiding the sheet passing through the feeding cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to be folded up. The limiting members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are as same as the conventional elements, so I do not describe the detail here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The rolling cylinders <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, which are made of metal, are disposed in the frame member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the opposite ends thereof pivoted to the side frames <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> respectively for free rotating. The rolling cylinders <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> position behind the last cylinder of the folding cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and close to the output tunnel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>.

Thus, the coupler belt <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can drive the feeding cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the folding cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the rolling cylinders <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The driving unit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, which is a motor in this prefer embodiment, is secured at the frame member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and coupled with the coupler belt <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the coupler assembly <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for driving the coupler belt <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Before operating, we pre-prepare a sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, which has glue capsule particles on the surface (not shown). The glue capsule particles will be broken by means of exerting a pressure on them and they will release glue received therein to spread the glue on the surface of the sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Please refer to FIGS. from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, operator puts the sheet into the input tunnel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the feeding cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will draw the sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> in and drive it running to the folding cylinders <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> automatically. The sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> will be driven by the folding cylinders <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> first and runs into the first limiting member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Then, please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> will be stopped in the limiting member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and will be bent at midsection. The bent section of the sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> will be drawn by the folding cylinders <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> continually and runs into the second limiting member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; to be stopped therein as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Now, the sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> will be bent again, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and will be drawn by the folding cylinders <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. After that, please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the folded sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> will driven to pass through the rolling cylinders <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. At this time, the glue capsule particles on the sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> will be broken to make the folded sheet stuck at predetermined portion. Finally, a folded and sealed sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> will be sent out of the frame member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the output tunnel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the sheet folding up and rolling machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention works with a printer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The printer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> sends the sheets <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> to the input tunnel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the sheet folding up and rolling machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> directly for the sheets <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> can be printed, folded and sealed in one step. That meets the workplaces of where need to process the sheets to mail in a large amounts within a short time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, operator can adjust the depths of the limiting members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to change where the sheets <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> to be bent. Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, if the depth of the first limiting member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is as same as the depth of the second limiting member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime;, the sheet will be folded up like the upper sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. But, if the depth of the first limiting member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is smaller than the depth of the second limiting member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime;, the sheet will be folded up like the bottom sheet <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the present invention are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> 1. The sheet folding up and rolling machine of the present invention has a high performance of folding up and sealing the sheet to be a mail in one step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 2. There is no labor work needed in the sheet process. It saves the cost a lot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> 3. The rolling cylinders will break glue capsule particles on the sheets and make them sealed. So, there is no need to provide an extra apparatus in the machine to seal the sheets. The size of the machine of the present invention will be smaller than the conventional machine. </paragraph>
