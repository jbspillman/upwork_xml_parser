<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a packet transmission method between a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter transmits packets to the receiver which contain useful data and which are referred to as data packets in the following of this description. The receiver detects lost data packets and transmits retransmission requests to the transmitter relating to at least some lost packets. An example of a system of this kind will be described in the following, in which said useful data is data coded in the MPEG-4 format. This example is not limitative. The invention applies to any type of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example of a transmission system according to the invention comprising a server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which performs the function of transmitter in terms of the invention, a transmission network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a terminal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which performs the function of receiver in terms of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The transmission network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in the form, for example, of a cellular network, such as a GPRS network or a UMTS network. The server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the transmission network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by means of a link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> accessing a packet-type network like the Internet. The terminal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to the cellular network by means of a radio link <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a video sequence source VSS represented by a block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a coder COD of the MPEG-4 type represented by a block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a data memory MEM represented by a block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a transmission/reception device TX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/RX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> represented by a block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and a microprocessor assembly E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> represented by a block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and comprising a working memory WM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a program memory PM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a processor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The coder COD receives as its input video sequences F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> supplied by the video sequence source VSS. It supplies coded data F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as its output. The coded data F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is placed in packets at the microprocessor assembly E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The packets formed in this way are transmitted to the transmission/reception device TX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/RX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from where they are transmitted over the transmission network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the link <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In some cases, the lost packets must be retransmitted when they are lost. In order to allow retransmission of this kind, at least part of the contents of the transmitted packets is stored in the data memory MEM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The terminal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a transmission/reception device TX<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>/RX<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> represented by a block <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, a decoder DEC of the MPEG-4 type represented by a block <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and a microprocessor assembly E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> represented by a block <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> which comprises a working memory WM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a program memory PM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a processor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The program memories PM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and PM<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> contain a program or a group of programs G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> respectively, containing program code instructions for employing a transmission method according to the invention such as will be described with regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Transmission between the server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the terminal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is effected by way of advantage by utilizing a transport protocol of the RTP type. The RTP transport protocol is described in the document RFC 1889 published by the IETF. In particular: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The useful data is transmitted from the server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the terminal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in data packets of the type described in paragraph 5 of RFC 1889. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> These data packets contain in particular a field entitled &ldquo;Sequence Number&rdquo;. The sequence number SN contained in this field is incremented by one unit each time a data packet is transmitted. It is intended to be utilized by the receiver in order to detect the loss of one or more data packets in a sequence of data packets. For example, if the receiver receives a packet with the sequence number <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, followed by another packet with the sequence number <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, it deduces from this that the packets that contained the sequence numbers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> have been lost. The SN field of a packet must be stored in the memory MEM in order to allow retransmission of that packet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> These data packets also contain a &ldquo;Payload&rdquo; field which contains the useful data, which is to say, in the example described here, data coded in the MPEG-4 format. The &ldquo;Payload&rdquo; field of a packet must be stored in the memory MEM in order to allow retransmission of that packet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The retransmission requests are transmitted from the terminal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in control packets of the type described in paragraph 6 of RFC 1889. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, the microprocessor assembly E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> assigns an importance level to each packet transmitted by the transmitter. And it constructs the transmitted packets in such a way that they comprise one or more fields intended to contain the importance level associated with one or more other packets. For example, each transmitted packet P<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>contains N importance levels relating to N previous packets in the order of transmission P<highlight><subscript>1-l</subscript></highlight>, . . . , P<highlight><subscript>i-N</subscript></highlight>. The number N of importance levels contained in a packet is determined as a function of the number of consecutive packets likely to be lost so that when a packet is lost, the receiver can recover its importance level from the first packet received correctly after the lost packet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment, the importance level of a packet is a function of the coding method utilized in order to code the useful data transmitted in that packet. The MPEG-4 standard envisages three coding methods: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> the coding method I (from the English &ldquo;Intra Coding&rdquo;) in which an image is only coded from data which it contains itself; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> the coding method P (from the English &ldquo;Predictive Coding&rdquo;) in which an image is coded by utilizing a reference image which precedes it in time; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> the coding method B (from the English &ldquo;Bidirectional Predictive Coding&rdquo;) in which an image is coded from a reference image which precedes it in time and a reference image which follows it in time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Images coded by utilizing the coding method I are particularly important since their loss prevents the reconstitution of images for which they have served as a reference image during coding. By way of advantage, the server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> therefore assigns a greater importance to images coded in accordance with the coding method I than images coded in accordance with the coding method P. Similarly, it assigns a greater importance to images coded in accordance with the coding method P than images coded in accordance with the coding method B. To this end, the coder COD supplies, in addition to the coded data F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a data item F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> relating to the coding method of said coded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment, the server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a video sequence analyser VSA (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by a block with dotted outline bearing the reference <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>). This video sequence analyser classifies the images in a video sequence in an image category which is one of several possible categories. It transmits a data item F<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the microprocessor assembly E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> relating to the image category to which the coded data F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmitted by the coder COD belongs. For example, in a video sequence relating to a football match, the image categories may be the goals, the game, the spectators, etc. Techniques for analysing video sequences are well known. In this respect, reference will be made, for example, to the article &ldquo;Analysis of Video Sequences: Table of contents and index creation&rdquo; by Joan Llach and Philippe Salembier published in the &ldquo;Proceedings of the International Workshop on Very Low Bitrate Video Coding&rdquo;, VLBV &apos;99 pages 52-56, Kyoto, Japan, October 1999. The data item F<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is utilized by the microprocessor assembly E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in order to assign an importance level to each packet. Using the example of the football match again, the images classified in the category &ldquo;goal&rdquo; have a higher importance level than the images classified in the category &ldquo;game&rdquo;, the latter having a higher importance level than the images classified in the category &ldquo;spectator&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In a third embodiment of the invention, in order to assign an importance level to the packets to be transmitted, the microprocessor assembly E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> takes account simultaneously of the data item F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> relating to the coding method of the image and the data item F<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> relating to the image category. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> At the receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, one or more fixed and/or variable retransmission strategies are defined and employed by the microprocessor assembly E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> For example, a fixed retransmission strategy may comprise authorising a certain number of retransmission requests as a function of the importance level of the packet. Using the previous examples again, in which three importance levels were defined, the following retransmission strategy can be defined, for example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> no retransmission request if the importance level is equal to 1, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> one retransmission request if the importance level is equal to 2, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> the number of retransmission requests is unlimited if the importance level is equal to 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A variable retransmission strategy may comprise, for example, taking account of the manner in which the available bandwidth is utilized when the retransmission request will be transmitted. For example, the lower the percentage of bandwidth utilized for retransmissions, the lower will be the importance level required for sending a retransmission request. The following strategy can be defined for example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> if 1% of the bandwidth or more is utilized for retransmissions, the importance level required for a retransmission request to be transmitted is equal to 3; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> if 0.5% to 1% of the bandwidth is utilized for retransmission, the importance level required for a retransmission request to be transmitted is equal to or greater than 2; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> if less than 0.5% of the bandwidth is utilized for retransmission, the importance level required for a retransmission request to be transmitted is equal to or greater than 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example of a packet transmission method according to the invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> method of this kind comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for transmitting packets P<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>from the transmitter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each packet P<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>comprises N fields C<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, . . . , C<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>which contain the N importance levels IL<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, . . . , IL<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>relating to N previous packets in the order of transmission P<highlight><subscript>i-1</subscript></highlight>, . . . , P<highlight><subscript>i-N</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for receiving the packets P<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for detecting lost packets P<highlight><subscript>k-j </subscript></highlight>by observation of the sequence numbers contained in the received packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for recovering the importance level IL<highlight><subscript>k-j </subscript></highlight>of a lost packet P<highlight><subscript>k-j</subscript></highlight>, in the field C<highlight><subscript>k-j </subscript></highlight>of the first packet P<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>received correctly after the lost packet P<highlight><subscript>k-j</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
