<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, particularly relates to the structure of an electrode for mounting a semiconductor chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, IC or LSI has been more and more integrated and the capacity has been increased. A package in which a semiconductor chip is mounted has been small-sized, the number of pins has been increased and the density of the semiconductor chip has been enhanced. Further, a multi-chip package (MCP) in which plural semiconductor chips are mounted has been practically used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, as information technology is rapidly popularized, a demand for the systemization of semiconductor devices that form an information processing unit has grown. The expectation of electronic system integration technology for integrating and systemizing plural LSIs and a versatile functional block including an optical device using a compound semiconductor and a high-frequency device has increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In element technique to be the most important in the electronic system integration, minute bonding technique is included. For representative joining technique that has been used, wire bonding technique, flip chip (FC) joining technique and tape automated bonding (TAB) technique can be given, and as particularly the flexibility of bump bonding technique used in the flip chip joining technique is high and high-density connection is enabled, the bump bonding technique is very important. The bump bonding technique is also used in chip on chip (COC) technique which is one of high-density MCP technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For the current most general bump bonding technique, technique for melting a solder bump and joining using it called controlled collapsible chip connection (C<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is well-known. However, recently, from a viewpoint of conserving global environment, freedom from lead (included in solder) is demanded and a bad effect of the residue after cleaning of flux used for removing an oxide film on the surface of the solder having upon the quality also comes into question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Then, in place of a solder bump, recently, joining using a gold (Au) bump is discussed. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the outline of the technique will be described below. FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are sectional views showing a schematic process of COC technique for joining two semiconductor chips via a gold bump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A, a</cross-reference> pad electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is formed in a predetermined region on the surface of a first semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a first gold bump <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed on the pad electrode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As described above, the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed. Wiring <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of a second semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> by copper or others and a second gold bump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is connected to a predetermined region of the wiring <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As described above, a second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are overlapped and the first gold bump <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the second gold bump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> on the second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are aligned. The first gold bump <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the second gold bump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are bonded, heating and pressurizing them. The temperature of heating is required to be 250&deg; C. or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In technique for melting and bonding solder bumps widely used in the current mounting technology, flux is essential to remove an oxide film on the surface of solder. To keep reliability, flux is generally required to be cleaned after bonding is completed, however, it has been difficult to completely clean flux as a bump becomes minute and pitch becomes short. In FC joining using a solder bump, the solder bump is melted and the shape greatly changes. Therefore, there is a limit in shortening pitch between bumps and it is difficult to enhance the density of a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the case of FC joining using the gold bumps explained referring to the drawings, the solid phase diffusion of gold is utilized in bonding gold. Then, as described above, the relatively high temperature of 250&deg; C. or more and pressure are required. Therefore, in mounting, IC is damaged and the characteristics of the IC are deteriorated. The problems become more remarkable as the density of IC is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In case a copper bump estimated to be able to lower heating temperature in the bonding is applied to an electrode in place of the gold bump based upon prior art, it is very difficult to bond electrodes such as a copper bump because of a copper oxide film easily oxidized at room temperature. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the outline of a first embodiment of the invention will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are schematic sectional views showing a case that two semiconductor chips are connected via bumps in the order of a manufacturing process. In the manufacturing process, the structure of a semiconductor device according to the invention is shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> pad electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed in a predetermined region on the surface of a first semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to a well-known method. The pad electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of aluminum or copper. A copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed on the pad electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The surface of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is easily oxidized differently from a case of a gold bump. The reason is that differently from noble metal such as Au, the surface of Cu is easily oxidized at room temperature. Then, such a first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is carried in a multipurpose processor formed by a multichamber. First, the plasma processing of argon and others is applied in a first chamber of the multipurpose processor. In the plasma processing, an oxide film on the surface of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is removed. In the plasma processing, inactive gas such as neon, helium, krypton and nitrogen in addition to argon is excited to be plasma and the oxide film may be also removed using a generated ion and others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Next, the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is carried in a second chamber of the multipurpose processor without being exposed to the air. Each surface of the first semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is exposed to the plasma of halogen. As described above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, an additive layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> including an additive such as a halogen atom is provided to the surface of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In case halogen is fluorine, reactive gas such as NF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas, SF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas, NF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl gas, NF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H gas and fluorocarbon is excited to be plasma and an F ion is doped. In case halogen is chlorine, Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas, HCl gas, NF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl gas or chlorocarbon gas is excited to be plasma. Or in case halogen is bromine (Br), Br<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas or HBr gas is excited to be plasma. In a process for forming the additive layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be also heated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Next, the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is carried in a third chamber of the multipurpose processor. An extremely thin insulating film is formed overall by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for exciting plasma. As described above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C, a</cross-reference> coating layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for coating each surface of the first semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed. The coating layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed by a silicon nitride film having thickness equivalent to 3 to 5 atoms (for example, the thickness of approximately 10 nm). Or the coating layer is formed by a film acquired by laminating a silicon oxynitride film and a silicon nitride film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The additive in the additive layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the superficial region of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is confined in the region by the formation of the coating layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The coating layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a function for preventing the surface of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from being oxidized. It is desirable that the coating layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the surface of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed so that the coating layer is thin (for example approximately 10 nm thick) in a part in which the bump is bonded and is thick (for example, approximately 100 nm thick) in a region except it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, wiring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of a second semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by copper or others and a gold bump <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is connected in a predetermined region of the wiring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. As described above, a second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed. The first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are overlapped, and the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> covered with the coating layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the gold bump <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are aligned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, heated pressure processing is applied. In the pressure processing, it is desirable that ultrasonic vibration is applied. The copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the gold bump <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are bonded by the pressure processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In a process for the pressure processing, the coating layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is mechanically broken by the deformation of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The temperature of the pressure processing is 150&deg; C. or less. The reason why the temperature is lower is that the diffusion of a copper atom in the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or that of a gold atom in the gold bump <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is accelerated by a halogen atom in the additive layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the bonding process, the breakage of the insulating film can be also accelerated by applying moderate ultrasonic vibration or mechanical friction by scrubbing or others to interfaces of bonding when both semiconductor chips are pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the principle of the invention will be described. FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are schematic sectional views showing a process for explaining the critical point of the invention in the processes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the surface of first bonding metal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> corresponding to the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is cleaned. That is, an oxide layer and others are removed and the surface of the first bonding metal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is exposed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, an additive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a halogen atom or others is doped in a superficial region of the first bonding metal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the plasma processing. For the conductive material of the first bonding metal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, gold, tin (Sn), solder or indium (In) and silver (Ag) are used in addition to copper. The additive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be also doped by ion plantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C, a</cross-reference> coating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the first bonding metal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The coating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a function for confining the additive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the first bonding metal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>D, second bonding metal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is pressed on the first bonding metal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In a process for pressure processing, the additive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is activated and enters the second bonding metal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in addition to the first bonding metal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The activation of the additive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is easily caused at low temperature. The diffusion of metallic elements forming the first bonding metal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second bonding metal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is accelerated. As described above, the bonding of the first bonding metal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second bonding metal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is accelerated and the lowering of the temperature of bonding is enabled. For the conductive material of the second bonding metal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, copper, tin, solder or indium and silver are used in addition to gold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the invention, as structure that atoms easily activated by heating are confined in the superficial region of the bonding metal is adopted, electrode structure in which first and second bonding metals can be bonded at low energy and low stress can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, a</cross-reference> second embodiment of the invention will be described. This embodiment is characterized in that an adhesive is used in place of the coating layer described in the first embodiment. The same reference number is allocated to the same part as the part shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, as described in the first embodiment, a first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided with a pad electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a predetermined region on the surface of a first semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> connected to the pad electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed. An additive layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a first adhesive layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided with wiring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> on the surface of a second semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a gold bump <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in a predetermined region of the wiring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed and a second adhesive layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The first or second adhesive layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is made of organic polymeric resin such as polyimide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are overlapped, and the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the gold bump <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are aligned on the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Heated pressure processing is applied. In the pressure processing, it is desirable that ultrasonic vibration is applied. The copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the gold bump <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are bonded by the pressure processing. In this embodiment, the first adhesive layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the second adhesive layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are bonded in a process for pressure processing. As described above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed between the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The adhesive layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is an organic adhesive such as resin. Such an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed by closely laminating in a nitrous atmosphere or a vacuum. The surface of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is prevented from being oxidized by such a method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In this case, in the process for pressure processing, the first and second adhesive layers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are also mechanically broken by the deformation of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the gold bump <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The temperature of the pressure processing is 150&deg; C. or less. The lowering of the temperature is the same as that described in the first embodiment and the reason is that the diffusion of a copper atom in the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or that of a gold atom in the gold bump <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is accelerated by a halogen atom in the additive layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the surface of the copper bump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this case, the breakage of the adhesive layers is also facilitated by applying moderate ultrasonic vibration or mechanical friction by scrubbing or others to the interfaces of bonding when both semiconductor chips are pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, the similar effect to the effect described in the first embodiment is also produced. Further, a process for sealing a junction called an underfill with resin generally performed in a flip chip joining process is omitted. This reason is that the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is automatically provided with a function for sealing with resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, a</cross-reference> third embodiment of the invention will be described. This embodiment is an example in which the invention is applied to COC technique using only copper bumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A, a</cross-reference> first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> provided with a first pad electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a predetermined region on the surface of a first semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a first copper bump <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> connected to the first pad electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed by the similar method to the method described in the first embodiment. An additive layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the first copper bump <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a first coating layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed on the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and on the surface of the first copper bump <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provided with a second pad electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in a predetermined region on the surface of a second semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a second copper bump <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> connected to the second pad electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed. A second coating layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and on the surface of the second copper bump <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The first or second coating layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed at the same way as the way described in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are overlapped, and the first copper bump <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the first semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the second copper bump <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> on the second semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are aligned. Heated pressure processing is applied. In the pressure processing, it is desirable that ultrasonic vibration is applied. The first copper bump <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the second copper bump <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are bonded by the pressure processing. In this case, in a process for the pressure processing, a part of the first coating layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a part of the second coating layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are also mechanically broken by the deformation of the first copper bump <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the second copper bump <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The temperature of the pressure processing is 100&deg; C. or less. The lowering of the temperature is the same as that described in the first embodiment and the reason is that the diffusion of a copper atom in the first and second copper bumps <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is accelerated by a halogen atom in the additive layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on the surface of the first copper bump <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In this case, the breakage of the first and second coating layers is also facilitated by applying moderate ultrasonic vibration or mechanical friction by scrubbing or others to the interfaces of bonding when both semiconductor chips are pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, the similar effect to the effect described in the first embodiment is also produced. Further, in this case, the first coating layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the second coating layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> function as a passivation film of the semiconductor chips. Therefore, in this case, a process for sealing a junction called an underfill with resin generally performed in a flip chip joining process is also omitted. Also in this case, as both electrodes are a copper bump, the lowering of the temperature of bonding is further facilitated. As described above, the damage of IC or the deterioration of characteristics in mounting caused in prior art is not caused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments, the case that the coating layer is formed by an insulating film is described. The invention is not limited to this and even if the coating layer is formed by a conductive film, for example, a TiN (titanium nitride) film or a TaN (tantalum nitride) film, the similar effect is produced. In case the coating layer is formed by the conductive layer, the coating layer is partially formed so that it coats the surface of the bump and it is required that the coating layer is not formed on the overall surface of the semiconductor chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, as described in the first embodiment, after the coating layer is formed, the adhesive layer may be also formed so that the adhesive layer coats the coating layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The invention is not limited to the case of COC technique The invention can be also similarly applied to the bonding of a pad electrode and wire or the bonding of a lead of a package and wire. The invention can be easily applied to technique for connecting a semiconductor chip and a wiring board. Further, the invention can be also similarly applied to the bonding of other metals. The shape of the surface of an electrode to be bonded may be also planar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The invention is not limited to the embodiments and the embodiments can be suitably changed in a range of technical ideas according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As described above, in a principal part of the invention, the additive including at least one type of atom different from an atom forming the electrode for electrically connecting the semiconductor chip and the wiring board or plural semiconductor chips is doped in the vicinity of the surface of the electrode and the insulator is formed on the surface of the electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As described above, bonding between the electrodes at low energy and low stress is facilitated by applying the structure that an atom of the additive easily activated by heating is confined in each superficial region of the electrodes to be bonded. The density of the semiconductor device is enhanced and the reliability of the semiconductor device is greatly enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will cover any modifications or embodiments as fall within the true scope of the invention. </paragraph>
