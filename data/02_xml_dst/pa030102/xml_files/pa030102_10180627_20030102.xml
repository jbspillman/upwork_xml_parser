<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Group communications methods and apparatus are described. In particular, methods for granting a mobile device access to a communications resource, e.g., the right to transmit data, associated with a group are described. User requests for the communications resource are suppressed by the corresponding mobile device, for periods during which the communications resource has been granted to another mobile device. A mobile device may store a suppressed user request so that a resource request signal may be transmitted after the communications resource has been released by the mobile device that was previously granted the resource. In this manner requests that cannot be granted are not transmitted, increasing communications efficiency as compared to systems where requests are not suppressed at the mobile devices. A priority scheme is used in some embodiments to determine whether or not a request should be suppressed while another device has been granted the communications resource. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A group communications system allows a plurality of users to participate in a group communication session with each other through a plurality of corresponding user communication devices interconnected through a communications network. Such a system may also include a controller device to facilitate coordination of communications in the group and access to communication resources associated with the group, i.e., the control device may assist with &ldquo;floor control&rdquo;. One purpose of floor control is to ensure that only one user communication device is transmitting data at any one time, while other user communication devices associated with the group communication session only receive data during the same time. Floor control also provides the method with which the right to transmit data and access to communication resources associated with the group are shared between the plurality of user devices. This typically involves user communication devices sending &ldquo;floor request&rdquo; signals to the controller device and the controller device &ldquo;granting the floor&rdquo; to user devices according to some policy, e.g., first come first served. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> While floor control functions can apply to any form of data communications, they are particularly useful in voice communications, since during a conversation amongst a group of people it is beneficial if there is only one speaker at any one time. Note that digitized and packetized voice is simply a subset of data communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The one sender many receivers property of a group communications session is exploited so that communication resources for sending data are only required by a single user communication device at a time, while communication resources for receiving data are required by the other user communication devices in the group. This is particularly beneficial when communication resources from the network to the user communication devices (downlink) are relatively in abundance, while communication resources from the user communication devices towards the network (uplink) are somewhat constrained. This is typical of cellular communications systems, which use wireless technology between the user communication devices and the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Some cellular communication systems, also allow a user communication device to operate in either a receive-only mode or a receive-transmit mode, where a user communication device that is in the receive-only mode consumes less system resources. In such systems, operation in the receive-transmit mode requires the use of additional control channels and thus increases overhead. Typically, transition of a user communication device between modes of operation is not instantaneous; therefore, if a user communication device transitions to the receive-transmit mode even to send a small amount of traffic, the device may remain in that mode consuming a larger percentage of system resources for a longer period of time. Secondly, system resources may also be consumed for signaling associated with the transitions between modes. Finally, a user communication device may consume power at a higher rate while in the receive-transmit mode. Thus the cost associated with sending even a small amount of traffic in the uplink may be significant and should be avoided when possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While group communications may be inherently well suited for cellular communication systems that have an ability to send downlink traffic to multiple user communication devices simultaneously, there is need for a floor control system that minimizes uplink signaling. In particular, there is a need for floor control system that minimizes the likelihood that a user communication device will transition to receive-transmit mode to send a floor request signal that will be rejected by the controller device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Methods and apparatus of the present invention can be used to support group communications between a plurality of end nodes interconnected via a communications system, e.g., network. End nodes may be implemented as wireless devices that include receiver and transmitter circuitry to support communications with wireless access nodes via a wireless communications channel. End nodes may be, for example, mobile devices and may include an IP host protocol stack. The access nodes may be, for example, base stations in a cellular communications system and may also function as an IP access router. The communications system, e.g., network, implemented in accordance with the invention includes a group communications controller node that assists in coordination of group communications and controls access to communications resources associated with a group and/or group communications session. The group communications controller node may be, for example, a server and may also include an IP protocol stack. IP packets may be used for the exchange of both data and control signaling between nodes in the system. In either case, delivery of IP packets from a source node to the targeted destination node or nodes may use either unicast or multicast addressing and delivery mechanisms. Control signaling implemented in accordance with the present invention may be, for example, based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In various embodiments, the group communications controller transmits resource grant messages and resource release messages using an IP multicast routing address corresponding to members of a group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An end node may include an input/output interface and one or more input/output devices that enable a user to control the device and use it for communications with the users of other similar devices. The end node may be, for example, a wireless phone with a keypad, display, microphone and speaker. In response to user input, e.g., a user resource request, an end node may exchange signaling with the group communications controller node to coordinate access to resources, e.g., the right to transmit data, associated with a group or group communications session. As part of the exchange signaling the end node may transmit a resource request to the controller node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An end node implemented in accordance with the present invention is capable of operating such that it suppresses user requests for group communications resources, when the resource request would not be granted by the group communications controller node. This suppress mode of operation may be entered by an end node in response to a message from the controller node indicating a resource grant to another end node in the group. The use of a suppress mode can be advantageous when the cost associated with transmission of even a small amount of information by an end node is relatively high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, during the suppress mode of operation an end node may store user requests. In cases where user requests are stored, the end node may later transmit a request for a group communications resources corresponding to the stored user request, after the group communications controller node has signaled that the resources have been released by the node to which they were previously granted. In accordance with the invention, the receipt of a release signal will cause an end node in the suppress mode to transition to another, e.g., idle, mode. This approach to group communications has the advantage of minimizing user interaction required to obtain group communications resources and minimizing the delay associated with obtaining resources. The group communications controller node may also further coordinate and control access to group communications resources by using scheduling techniques or methods to determine the order and timing of sending resource release signals to the end nodes within a group. Depending on the scheduling technique or method, this can be used as a way of ensuring fairness or providing priority access to group communications resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Priority information may be maintained by end nodes and the group communications controller node. In some embodiments, priority information is included in control signaling between nodes to provide greater priority access control. The use of such additional priority information enables an end node to selectively suppress user resource requests, based on the relative priority of the requesting user or end node and the priority at which the group communications resource has been granted. Thus, even if a group communications resource is currently granted to a first user, a second user with sufficient priority may preempt the prior grant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Numerous additional embodiments, features, and advantages of the methods and apparatus of the invention are discussed in the detailed description that follows. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The following describes the events, signals, and operations associated with controlling access to a group communications resource associated with a group communications session. The arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> represent user input operations and signals, e.g., messages, used between users <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime;, end nodes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; and group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to request and grant access to the resources associated with the group communication session which in this case includes the right to send data. It is assumed that initially the end nodes are in an idle mode of operation and the group communications resource is available, i.e., no users associated with the group communications session are sending data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> performs a URR (User Resource Request) input operation <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, e.g., presses a key, causing an internal signal to be generated by user input device <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The URR input operation <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and corresponding internal signal indicate that the user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> wants to send data. In response to the URR input operation <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> accesses its internal communications data <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to determine if the group communications resource is currently granted to another group member. Since its internal communications data <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> indicates that the resource is available (in accordance with the initial assumption of this example), end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> sends a corresponding DRR (Device Resource Request) signal <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> to the group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The DRR signal <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> indicates that end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> wants to send data to a particular group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of the DRR signal <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, the group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> accesses its internal communications data <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to determine if the group communications resource should be granted in response to the DRR signal <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment of the present invention, this operation may simply be a determination of whether the requested group communications resource is available or is currently granted to another group member. In alternative embodiments, this operation may also include an assessment of the relative priority of the requesting group member and other factors to determine if the resource request should be granted, i.e., even if the resource is currently granted the relative priority of the group members could be used to selectively preempt an existing grant upon reception of a request from a higher priority user. In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> example, since the resource is available, the group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> grants end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the corresponding user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> the right to send data by sending a RG (Resource Grant) signal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>&prime; to end nodes, e.g., all end nodes, associated with members of the group. The RG signal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> sent to end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes sufficient information to indicate that the group communications resources has been granted to end node X and/or the corresponding user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, while the RG signals <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>&prime; sent to end nodes associated with other group members need only indicate that the resource has been granted. In one embodiment of the present invention, the RG signal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> sent to end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes information that can be used to match the RG signal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> with the previously sent DRR signal <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, e.g., a sequence number and/or identification value. In alternative embodiments, the RG signal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> may also include information that identifies end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or the corresponding user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the RG signals <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>&prime; may include information that indicates the relative priority of the group member to which the group communications resource has been granted. Also, in some embodiments, the RG signals <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>&prime; sent to end nodes, e.g., all end nodes, associated with members of the group may contain the same information, in which case the RG signals <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>&prime; may be sent using broadcast or multicast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of the RG signal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> enables its corresponding user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to start transmitting data to the group, e.g., sending voice via the audio input device <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In some embodiments, end nodes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; may also provide an indication, e.g., visual and/or auditory signal, to their corresponding users <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively, that the group communications resource has been granted. Reception of the RG signal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>&prime; by end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; indicates that the group communications resource has been granted to another member of the group, in this case user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Upon reception the RG signal, end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; changes from an idle mode to a suppression mode of operation, during which end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; will suppress resource request attempts made by its corresponding user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime;. While in the suppression mode, end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; may receive data sent to the communications group, e.g., voice data sent from the user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment end node Y also provides the received data to its corresponding user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime;, e.g., sending voice via the audio output device <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> example further illustrates the events, signals and operations that occur when the user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime; of end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; attempts to request resources associated with the same communications group for which the resources have already been granted to the user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime; of end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; performs a URR input operation <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, e.g., presses a key, causing an internal signal to be generated by user input device <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>&prime; of end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime;. The URR input operation <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and corresponding internal signal indicate that the user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime; of end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; wants to send data. In response to the URR input operation <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; accesses its internal communications data <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime; to determine if the group communications resource is currently granted to another end node, i.e., if end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; is in the suppression mode. According to one embodiment of the present invention, since its internal communications data <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime; indicates that the resource is currently granted to another end node and end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; is in the suppression mode, end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; immediately returns an error signal <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> to its corresponding user, e.g., a visual and/or auditory signal via the respective output device <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>&prime;. In an alternative embodiment, end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; may store an indication that a URR input operation <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> was performed by its corresponding user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime; and not return an error message. If the group communications resource is subsequently released, the stored indication that a URR input operation <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> was performed will be used to determine if a DRR signal should be sent to the group communications controller node. Also, in some embodiments, in response to the URR input operation, end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; may compare the relative priority of its corresponding user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime; with the priority at which the group communications resource is currently granted to another user, to determine whether a DRR signal (not shown) should be sent to the group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to preempt the existing resource grant, as opposed to either sending an error signal <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> or storing an indication that a URR input operation was performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> example also illustrates the events, signals and operations that occur when the user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> releases the resources that have been granted to it. At some point later the user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> ends its transmission of data and releases the resources by performing a URREL (user Resource Release) input operation <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> e.g., presses or releases a key, causing an internal signal to be generated by user input device <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In response to the URREL input operation <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> sends a corresponding DRREL (Device Resource Release) signal <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> to the group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Upon reception of the DRREL signal, the group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> notifies members, e.g. all members, of the group that resources for that group are now available by sending a RREL (Resource Release) <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>&prime; signal to end nodes associated with members of the group. The group communications controller node may use a variety of scheduling methods to determine the order and timing with which RREL signals <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>&prime; are sent to end nodes associated with group members. In some embodiments, the RREL signals <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>&prime; sent to end nodes associated with group members may contain the same information, in which case the RREL signals <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>&prime; may be sent using broadcast or multicast </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of the RREL signal <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>&prime;, end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; changes from suppression mode to an idle mode of operation. Provided that end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; had stored an indication that a URR input operation was performed while end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; was in the suppression mode, end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; would immediately send a DRR signal (not shown) to the group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, end nodes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; may also provide an indication, e.g., visual and/or auditory signal, to their corresponding users <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively, that the group communications resource has been released. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> example further illustrates a resource request from end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; that occurs after the group communications resource has been released by end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The user <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime; of end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; performs a URR input operation <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> to end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime;. In response to the URR input operation <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; sends a DRR signal <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> to the group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Upon reception of the DRR signal <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>, the group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, will determine whether the resource should be granted to end node Y <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime;, as it did for end node X <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at the beginning of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> description. </paragraph>

The end node is operated by a user member of a communications group as part of communication system, e.g., as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>. Group communications sessions are controlled by a group communications controller node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> implemented according to the present invention, e.g., as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, operational states are depicted as circles, while arrows between the states indicate state transitions according to this invention. Dotted arrows and text in parenthesis &ldquo;( )&rdquo; indicate features present in an alternative embodiment of this invention which is also described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> embodiment depicts three operational states, idle <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, suppress <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and send <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. While in any of these states, an end node implemented according to this invention monitors the input/output interface <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> for user input operations and the communication channel for floor control signals, e.g., messages, from the group communications controller node. In idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the end node monitors for input operations and other signals that may trigger a change in operational state. In suppress state <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, the end node additionally operates such that it suppresses requests for resources from the user. The end node <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> transitions to the send state <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> when it has been granted the communications resource; thus, while in the send state <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, the end node may transmit data to the group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of this invention, when signal RGTO (Resource Grant to Other) is received while in the idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the end node makes a transition <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> to the suppress state, since signal RGTO indicates that resources were granted to another member of the group. In one embodiment of this invention, reception of a URR input operation while in the suppress state <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> results in the suppression of the resource request and transmission of an error message to the user indicating that resources for that group are not available and the return <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> to the same suppress state <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. Upon reception of a RREL signal while in the suppress state <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, indicating that the resources for said group have been released, the end node makes a transition <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> back to the idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. Reception of a RREL signal while in idle state causes the end node to return <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> to the same idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. According to this invention, when a URR input operation is received while in the idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the end node sends a DRR signal to the group communications controller node and returns <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> to the same idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. If the controller grants the resources requested, a RGTS (Resource Grant to Self) signal will be received while the end node is still in the idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. When a RGTS signal is received while in the idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the end node makes a transition <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> to the send state <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> and the user can now transmit data to the group. When the user data transmission is complete and the user releases the resources by performing a URREL input operation. When a URREL input operation is received while in the send state <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, the end node makes a transition <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> from the send state <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to the idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and sends a DRREL signal to the group communications controller node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In some alternative embodiments of this invention, a relative priority may be associated with each group member and some of the signals sent between nodes may also include an indication of relative priority. In one particular embodiment of this invention reception of a RGTO signal by a end node while in idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, cause a transition <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> to the suppress state <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> only if the priority level indicated in the RGTO signal is higher than or equal that owned by the user of the said end node. A RGTO signal indicating a lower relative priority than that owned by the user of the said end node causes the end node to return <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> to the same idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. In the latter case, the user can still request resources for this group by performing a URR input operation and interrupt, e.g., preempt, the user with a lower relative priority that has been granted access to the resources. Accordingly, reception of a RGTO signal by an end node while in the send state <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, may indicate that the resource has been granted to another user with a higher relative priority that of said end node. In which case, the end node makes a transition <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> from the send state <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to the suppress state <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In this alternative embodiment of the invention, reception of a URR input operation by the end node while in suppress state <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>&prime;, causes a transition <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> to the store state <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. In the store state <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, the end node effectively stores the user requests for resources. Any additional URR input operations received while in the store state <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> cause the end node to replace the stored URR input operation information with information regarding the new URR input operation before it returns <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> to the same store state <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. When aRREL signal is received while in this store state <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, the end node sends a DRR signal to the group communications controller node according to the last URR input operation that was received and makes a transition <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> to the idle state <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of this present invention, when the end node is in the store state <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, it can also receive a URREL signal from the user indicating that the user no longer requires resources for this group, in which case the end node will transition (not shown in the figure) back to suppress state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In some alternative embodiments of the present invention, communications between nodes is based all, or in part, on the Internet Protocol (IP). Thus, communication of both data and/or control signaling between members of a communications group, end nodes associated with group members and the group communications controller node may use IP packets, e.g., datagrams. IP packets may be delivered to the their intended destination nodes using either unicast or multicast addressing and delivery mechanisms. The use of IP multicast is particular useful when the same information is sent from one node to a plurality of other nodes. This is typically the case for data communications between group members, and may also be the case for certain control signals that target a plurality of nodes, e.g., the RG signal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>&prime; and the RREL signal <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>&prime; depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In cases where the same information, e.g., packet payload data, is sent to a plurality of targeted nodes using unicast delivery, a separate IP packet with a copy of the information is sent by the source node to each targeted node. Alternatively, when the same information is sent to a plurality of targeted nodes using multicast delivery, a single IP packet with the information is sent by the source node and network nodes replicate the packet as required for delivery to each targeted node. Thus, IP multicast provides a more efficient means of delivering information from a source node to a group of destination nodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In some alternative embodiments of the present invention, the exchange of control signals, e.g., messages, between nodes is based all, or in part, on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). SIP messaging may be used both for the initial establishment of a group communications session and for the signaling associated with arbitration and control of access to group communications resources. SIP messaging may be sent using either unicast or multicast delivery mechanisms. Group communications resource control messaging may also be unified and/or integrated with control messaging associated with establishment, maintenance and teardown of group communications session and/or with control messaging associated with maintenance of group member presence information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Additional aspects, features, methods, apparatus and exemplary embodiments which are part of the inventive methods and apparatus, to which the present patent application is directed, are described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/301,239, filed on Jun. 27, 2001, titled &ldquo;METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR USING SIP SIGNALING TO SUPPORT GROUP COMMUNICATIONS OVER FLASH-OFDM&rdquo; which is cited in the related applications section of the present application and which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
