<heading lvl="1">Field of Use </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The field of use for the dial indicator cap described in this specification is for determining the required amount of a substance, such as a medication, as a function of a variable, such as the weight of a patient. However, the concept and structure described and claimed in this specification is useful for determining the amount of a first substance as a function of a second substance for myriad applications. An example of another application is the volume of oil to be added to a volume of gasoline for a two-cycle engine, which is determined by the the manufacturer&apos;s specified ratio of oil to gasoline multiplied by the gasoline volume. For purposes of illustration of an embodiment of the invention claimed in this specification, a medication application will be the application described in the &ldquo;Summary of an Embodiment of the Invention,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Brief Description Of The Drawings&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;Detailed Description And Operation Of The Invention&rdquo; sections of this specification. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Inaccurate prescriptive medication suspension, such as antibiotics, and over-the-counter medication dosing in the pediatric patient population (3 years of age and younger) is common and costly. The medical literature is abundant with statistics and objective data supporting the finding that inaccurate medication dosing in the pediatric patient population is a common problem. For example, a significant number of pediatric patients are: hospitalized with medication dosing errors; die as a result of dosing errors; taken to emergency rooms with persistent fever-related illnesses due to under-dosage with acetaminophen; and treated for over-dosage with acetaminophen. Studies confirm that a large majority of caregivers: fail to give the required dosage of the over-the-counter medication acetaminophen; do not accurately read and follow labeling instructions; fail to increase dosage as the pediatric patient&apos;s age or weight increases; or give less than the manufacturer&apos;s recommended dosage. It is also known that: over-the-counter pediatric medications have no specific instructions for dosing a child under the age of 2; for most over-the-counter pediatric medication in liquid form, the dosing instructions are by &ldquo;age&rdquo; for children under the age 2 and by &ldquo;weight&rdquo; for children above the age 2, which is conflicting and unclear; and when the medication bottle is removed from the packaging and the packaging is discarded, the complicated dosing instructions, which are generally on the packaging, are no longer available to the caregiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There must be greater assurance that the medication recommended for the pediatric population is dosed correctly. Medication labeling is the only tool available to assure the consumer of accurate dosing. However, labeling has proven to be ineffective, confusing, costly, and controversial. Improving the label will not dramatically improve the rate of accuracy in dosing medications. A simple, inexpensive, consumer friendly device for dosing accuracy should replace the current standard of labeling. And, the dosing information should be integral to the medication container. The dial indicator cap is such a simple, inexpensive, consumer friendly device to replace or supplement the labeled dosage information. Indeed, like the label, it is integral to the medication container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The dial indicator cap is a unique, innovative combination of a closure cap for a medication container and a device for determining dosage for prescriptive and over-the-counter medications. It utilizes existing closure cap design concepts with minimal modification. The dial indicator cap either minimizes the need for detailed labeling or is an adjunct to labeling. It provides an almost error proof method for the consumer to determine dosage. Even when used in conjunction with a label, it becomes the primary source for proper dosing. The basic closure for medication bottles remains the same. The invention of this specification comprises a range of pediatric patient weights and corresponding dosage amounts imprinted on the top, outer surface of the closure cap. A rotatable disk is axially aligned with and superimposed over the closure cap with a first viewing window that when rotated displays the various weights imprinted on the top, outer surface of the closure cap and a second viewing window that when rotated displays the corresponding medication dosage imprinted on the top, outer surface of the closure cap. The consumer simply rotates the disk to display the pediatric patient&apos;s weight in the first viewing window and then views the dosage in the second viewing window. A click-stop index means, which is designed to cause a clicking action between the viewing disk and closure cap, locks-in the weight and corresponding dosage information. A consumer in an &ldquo;English&rdquo; units system will find milliliters and pounds to be the most convenient and understandable units of measure. Therefore, it is preferred that these units be imprinted on the top of the closure cap so that all necessary information for precise dosing is contained on the dose cap and conversion to other units is not necessary. In a &ldquo;metric&rdquo; unit system, it will, be preferred that the numbers be imprinted in metric units. Current labeling practices allow the use of metric units in an &ldquo;English&rdquo; unit country such as the United States of America, further compounding the probability of dosing errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The purchaser of a prescription medication or an over-the-counter medication in a container capped with the dial indicator cap, needs to only know the child&apos;s weight. The purchaser who is usually the parent dials in the child&apos;s weight so it is visible through a first window and then reads the precise dose shown in a second window. The dose is then poured into a suitable measuring instrument and administered to the child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Some of the objects of the dial indicator cap are to: be a replacement or adjunct for the confusing, costly, detailed labeling system currently in use; be the primary source for determining dosage as a function of weight or some other factor; simplify parental dosing instructions; be an inexpensive modification of existing closure caps while allowing incorporation of currently used child safety cap features; be consumer friendly; improve caregiver compliance with dosing instructions; ensure precise dosing of all pediatric medications; allow adjustment to dosing with a child&apos;s advancing weight and age; reduce dosing errors and related costs; meet the expectations of the consumer and medical community; meet or exceed Food and Drug Administration regulations and policies on dosing; allow accurate dosing for children under 2 years old; maintain all dosing instructions as an integral part of the medication container, so packaging materials may be discarded without concern; significantly improve and safeguard the health and safety of pediatric children; and improve the efficacy of pediatric medication by assisting accurate dosing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Each dial indicator cap is tailored to a specific medication according to the manufacturer&apos;s specifications. The cap may be tailored, for example, to accommodate all prescriptive antibiotic suspensions for children and all over-the-counter pediatric liquid medications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This &ldquo;Summary of an Embodiment of the Invention&rdquo; section describes a medication application embodiment of the invention claimed in this specification only for purposes of illustration. It is to be understood that this invention may be used for myriad other applications.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a prior art medication bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, comprising a cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a label <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and a thread <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the bottle neck most often used to contain a liquid pharmacological substance for dispensing to a consumer. Variants of a prior art medication bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be found on most pharmacy shelves. They are used for dispensing both prescription and over-the-counter fluid medication. Medication bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be used for containing liquids used for animals, humans, or plants. Prior art medication bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may contain almost any type of liquid, including a medicant or a toxic fluid such as a poison, weed killer, or pesticide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Typically, a pharmacist or the manufacturer states the dosage on the bottle label <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, such as two teaspoons twice per day. In the case of medications for pediatric patients, such simple dosage instructions fail to account for the weight of the child, which can vary widely from patient to patient or change dramatically as an infant gains weight over the course of its treatment regimen. Without changing the dosage to account for differences in weight among the various pediatric patients or for the change in weight over time for any given patient, the dosage can be dramatically excessive or inadequate. Very often instructions are included with medication bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that alerts the caregiver (generally a parent) of the necessity of increasing the dosage as the child&apos;s weight increases. These instructions are often discarded by the caregiver with the disposal of the box in which medication bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is contained or if such warning instructions are on label <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (space limitations often will not allow inclusion of such detail on a label) they are difficult for the caregiver to follow, forgotten, or too small to be easily read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention improves prior art medication bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by replacement of prior art cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a unique, innovative, and consumer friendly dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an exploded cross sectional elevational view of an exemplar of dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> serves dual functions. It functions as an indicator of the amount of fluid to be administered for various child weights or other variables. And, it functions as a cap for closure of prior art medication bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> To the extent shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is comprised of closure cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a means for rotatably affixing dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, such as for example by rivet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is rotatably fixed to closure cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by rivet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which extends in axially alignment (as shown by centerline, C/L) through dial aperture <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and closure cap aperture <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Rivet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is of such a length that when inserted and fastened at both of its head ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> it positions dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> into planar mating engagement, yet allows the consumer to rotate dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with respect to top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> using only minimal finger pressure. The minimal finger pressure must be enough that once dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is rotated, it will not rotate further without the application once again of such minimal pressure. As illustrated, finger grip bumps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be integrally molded into dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to give a frictional surface to dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to allow the consumer&apos;s fingers to rotate dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Finger grip bumps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as illustrated, are only one of many means available to one skilled in the art for providing a finger grip. For example, scoring, knurling, or serration of sidewall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are means for providing a frictional surface to assist the using for rotating dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Sidewall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> vertical dimension may require enlargement to accommodate the user&apos;s fingers when gripping sidewall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. For purposes of this specification, vertical shall be defined as the direction from the top of prior art medication container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in position for closure of container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the base of container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is placed on a horizontal surface. Sidewall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may also be enlarged by extending side wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> down vertically in an annular ring to form a hood <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over the upper portion of closure cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. To do so, requires that the inside diameter of hood <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> portion of dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> be slightly larger than the diameter of top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Hood <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> could also limit lateral movement of dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> relative to the top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, provide a guide way for smoother rotation of dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and prevent upward bending of dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, depending on closely its inside dimensions matched the outside dimensions of container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Dial click stop serration <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and matingly engaged closure cap click stop serration <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> provide frictional engagement of dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> so that once the user rotates dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the desired position relative to closure cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will stay in the chosen position, sometimes referred as an indexed position, until further rotation by consumer/user. Dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> must be designed so that a comfortable frictional force of the user is sufficient to overcome the resistance of serration&apos;s <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to rotate dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, yet not allow the usual nonconsumer/nonuser forces to spontaneously change dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> setting. Mating serrations <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is only one approach of many to inhibit dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from rotating by normally encountered forces other than the user&apos;s force. For example, instead of annular serrations <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, annular serrations could be placed inside the wall of hood <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> described above and mating serrations positioned in an annular ring on the upper portion of outside of closure cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Secure closure means of dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to a container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be accomplished by use of internal threads <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in closure cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for mating engagement with outside threads on medication container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or the treads could be reversed so that the threads on closure cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are on its outside wall and the mating threads on container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are on its inside. A removable or irremovable snap lock may also be used for a secure closure means of cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. There are other methods of secure closure means known by one skilled in the art that are suitable means of closure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates assembled dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. For clarity, serrations <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, finger grip bumps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and threads <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are not shown. Rivet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be molded plastic with upper and lower heads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> added after rivet shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is inserted through dial and closure cap apertures <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. An alternative means of forming rivet heads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is by a compressive force (sometimes including heat in the case of plastics) simultaneously exerted against the top and bottom of an inserted rivit shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, thereby squishing the ends of rivit shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to form rivit heads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in situ. Whichever method is used to form rivit heads, rivet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> must rotatably fix dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to closure cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Care must be taken to avoid compressing dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> too tightly against top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the point that rotation by normal finger pressure is not possible. Furthermore, rivet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be formed with a head <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed on one end and a prong in the shape of an arrowhead formed on the other end. The shoulder of the prong is of a larger diameter than dial and closure cap apertures <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The prong is driven through apertures <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, whereby the prong and apertures are deformed to accommodate the prong, and then, due to the resilient nature of the plastic material out of which the prong of rivit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and closure cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are made, the prong of rivit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, closure cap aperture <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and dial aperture <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> return to their original shape. Due to the shoulder of the prong, the prong cannot be retracted from aperture <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Of course, any manufacturing method that reaches the goal of rotatably fixing dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to closure <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is acceptable, including eliminating rivet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> entirely. The goal is to have a user rotatable dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is some space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> between dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and closure cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as shown is enlarged for illustration purposes only. Space <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> would most likely be small enough that dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are touching one another, yet free to rotate relative to one another. </paragraph>

Furthermore, first and second windows <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be used for any other related variables. Weight and dosage units may be imprinted on top of dial <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in close proximity to windows <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, for illustration purposes only, shows them in milliliters and pounds, respectively. The dosage can be in ounces, teaspoons, liters, milligrams, or any other appropriate unit. Milliliters is the most commonly used units for pediatric patients, although most pharmaceutical companies state dosage in milliliters per kilogram of weight, which is not very useful for the average consumer in the United States. Dosage will most likely be imprinted on outer ring <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> because pediatric dosage generally has a wider range than does weight. This then requires a greater circumference than does the weight range to make the weight and the corresponding dosage appear in their respective windows <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> throughout each of their ranges. Dosage amounts will generally be fitted into an arc of 180 degrees or less when on outer ring <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, in certain special cases, which may be of a nonmedical application, dosage could be on inner ring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the other variable such as weight placed on outer ring <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a conceptual illustration for an antibiotic suspension and over-the-counter liquid medication. In the illustrated case, the frequency of dosage is indicated as every 6 hours and is a constant regardless of the child&apos;s weight. Preferably, the frequency of dosage will be imprinted on dial <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The dosage is determined as a function of both the child&apos;s weight and the frequency of dosage. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> illustrates dosage along a circumferential arc in outer ring <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so that when first window <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is moved to the patient&apos;s weight, which weights are displayed along a circumferential arc in the inner ring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, second window <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> frames the correct dosage number on outer ring <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> on top of closure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The placement of numbers in inner and outer rings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along their respective circumferential arcs and the distance of rings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the center of top of the closure <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> will differ for the chosen range of weights and the concomitant dosages for any given medication. Usually, the diameter of inner ring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> depends upon the number of arc degrees or radians that the numbers in outer ring <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> occupy and also upon how many discrete numbers are placed on inner ring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In other words, each dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will differ as to placement of windows <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the numbers on outer and inner rings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, depending upon the medication being dispensed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Generally, the pharmaceutical company distributing the medication will supply the medication with a dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> specifically made for that medication. For ease of viewing by the consumer, the colors of the numbers appearing in each of windows <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> should be different than one another. For example, the number color appearing in window <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> could be yellow and the number color in window <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> could be red. In a similar manner, the color on the dial along the outer circumferential area where window <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is located could be green and the inner circumferential area where window <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is located could be purple. </paragraph>

The arrangement of the numbers for the dosage corresponding to the weight of the patient is similar to the arrangement previously shown; with the exception that third window <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is added for the dosage subsequent to the initial dosage period. Although not shown, a corresponding set of numbers for the subsequent dosage is included on top of closure cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, either in a third ring or in a separate portion of the same ring that contains the numerical information for the initial dosage. The subsequent dosage window <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is placed in top of dial <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to correspond with the placement of the numerical information for the subsequent dosage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> This &ldquo;Detailed Description And Operation Of The Invention&rdquo; section describes a medication application embodiment of the invention claimed in this specification only for purposes of illustration. It is to be understood that this invention may be used for myriad other applications. Furthermore, one skilled in the art can make changes in structure, material, and arrangement of structures without departing from the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A number of other applications for the dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> were set forth in this specification. It is emphasized that the invention has a broader application than to the illustrated embodiment of this specification. The series of numbers within the range of weight described in the embodiment imprinted on inner ring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in pounds and viewable through first window <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a first set of information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. First set of information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprises a series of discrete weights of a child, in the case of the illustrated embodiment described in this specification. Each of these discrete weights or numbers is a first information bit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Although, in the illustrated embodiment the first bits <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are a series of weights of a child, they may be weights of anything, a measure of volume of anything, or any other unit of measure of any other thing. Therefore, first set of information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is a set of first bits <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of some type of information, wherein first bits <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are discrete quantities within the first set of information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the series of numbers within the range of dosage described in the illustrated embodiment imprinted on outer ring <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in milliliters and viewable through second window <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a second set of information <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Second set of information <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> also comprises a series of discrete dosage volume numbers, in the case of the illustrated embodiment described in this specification. Each of these discrete numbers is a second information bit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Although, based upon the illustrated embodiment the second information bits <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are a series of dosage volume numbers for medication of a child, they may be volumes of anything, a measure of weight of anything, or any other unit of measure of any other thing. Therefore, second set of information <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is a second set of information bits <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of some type of information, wherein second information bits <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are discrete quantities within the set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provides the user with a means to determine a second bit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of a second set of information <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> that is a function of a first bit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a first set of information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Generally, the user will choose first bit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that indicates the known quantity and use the dial indicator cap to determine second bit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> that indicates the unknown quantity. Second bit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of a second set of information <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is functionally related to first bit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a first set of information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> if second bit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the second set of information <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is dependently related to first bit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the first set of information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by some algorithm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, dial indicator cap <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may provide, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the user with a means to determine a third bit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of a third set of information <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that is a function of and dependently related to first bit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the first set of information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by some algorithm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
