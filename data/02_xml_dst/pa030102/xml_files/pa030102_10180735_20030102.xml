<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of post treatment for a metal line of semiconductor device, and more particularly to a method of post treatment of semiconductor device for a metal line formed on a substrate in a predetermined pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As is generally known, a patterning process is performed to form a metal line having a various shape in a semiconductor device. A dry etch process using plasma may be mentioned as an example of etch process for forming a metal line by etching aluminum alloy into a predetermined pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The metal line on the substrate is filled up by Inter Metal Dielectric (IMD) in accordance with a post treatment process to compensate a time constant. A low-dielectric-constant fluorine doped silicon glass (FSG) is widely used as the metal dielectric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the FSG, the main component F is a corrosive gas, causing metal etching in contact with metal. Therefore, if the F is increased to lower dielectric constant, metal corrosion is generated, thereby degrading reliability of semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, a TEOS oxide layer or HDP USG (High Density Plasma Undoped Silicon Glass) has been formed as a protecting layer (a lower layer of FSG) prior to the application of FSG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C are drawings showing a conventional method of post treatment for a metal line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> metal line <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in a predetermined pattern. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> protecting layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed with a predetermined thickness prior to forming FSG as IMD to reduce time constant. A TEOS oxide layer or HDP USG is generally employed as the protecting layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C, a</cross-reference> deposition process is performed to form a fluorine doped silicon glass (FSG) <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on the entire surface of the protecting layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, thereby completing post treatment for the metal line <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The time constant is compensated by the resulting FSG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, the protecting layer of TEOS oxide layer or HDP USG is subject to many drawbacks that the insulation is relatively low and that it is difficult to completely prevent the diffusion of F in FSG, thereby corroding the metal line and lowering reliability. Moreover, the stress between different materials (TEOS oxide layer or HDP USG and metal material) also results in the degradation of reliability of metal line. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the present invention has been proposed to solve the above problems and the primary objective of the present invention is to provide a method of post treatment for a metal line of semiconductor device capable of improving reliability of metal line by employing aluminum oxide layer as a protecting layer of metal line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to accomplish the above objective, one aspect of the present invention comprises the steps of: forming aluminum having a predetermined thickness on the entire surface of substrate having the metal line by a deposition process; changing the aluminum into a lower barrier layer of aluminum oxide layer by performing plasma treatment under a predetermined processing condition; and forming an inter metal dielectric layer on the entire surface of the lower barrier layer by performing a deposition process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention comprises the steps of: forming a lower barrier layer of aluminum oxide layer having a predetermined thickness on the entire surface of substrate having the metal line by performing a deposition process; and performing a deposition process to form an inter metal dielectric layer on the entire surface of the lower barrier layer.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The objects and features of the invention may be understood with reference to the following detailed description of an illustrative embodiment of the invention, taken together with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The main point of the present invention is that aluminum oxide layer (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) is employed, differently from the conventional method using TEOS oxide layer or HDP USG as a protecting layer. The Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>has improved insulation and prevents the diffusion of F and is similar material to the metal line, thereby realizing the objectives of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C are drawings showing a later process on a wafer having a metal line for post treatment of a metal line according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> metal line <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is formed in a predetermined pattern on a substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, Al is deposited to have a predetermined thickness (for example 80&tilde;150 &angst;, preferably 100 &angst;) as a lower barrier material on the entire surface of the metal line <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in accordance with a CVD or PVD prior to the formation of FSG as IMD to reduce a time constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a plasma treatment is performed on the lower barrier material (Al) with O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O under a predetermined processing condition, thereby changing the lower barrier material (Al) into a lower barrier layer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of aluminum oxide layer Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Compared with TEOS oxide layer or HDP USG, the Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>on the metal line <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has improved insulation and prevents diffusion of F in an inter metal dielectric layer <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to be formed on the lower barrier layer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> by a later process, not generating stress with the metal line <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C, a</cross-reference> deposition process is performed to form a FSG <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> on the upper surface of the lower barrier layer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, thereby a post treatment for the metal line formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is completed and RC delay is compensated by the FSG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is formed as a lower barrier layer on the metal line by depositing Al and performing a plasma treatment. However, it is illustrated only as an embodiment, and the Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>may be formed on the metal line in accordance with a CVD process to accomplish the objective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, an aluminum oxide layer (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), similar material to the metal line, is employed as a lower barrier layer to protect metal line, thereby improving insulation and preventing diffusion of F. Moreover, it is also possible to reduce stress with metal line, thereby increasing reliability of metal line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described and illustrated with reference to specific illustrative embodiments thereof, it is not intended that the invention be limited to those illustrative embodiments. Those skilled in the art will recognize that variations and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is therefore intended to include within the invention all such variations and modifications which fall within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
