<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A four-way switching valve free from leakage of a refrigerant. A pressure-regulating chamber is switchably connected to a low-pressure chamber or a high-pressure chamber by a three-way solenoid valve, and a pressure-regulating chamber is communicated with a chamber by a tube. When the three-way solenoid valve connects the pressure-regulating chamber to the low-pressure chamber, a plug is urged by the high pressure, thereby permitting port A and a port B to communicate with each other, while inhibiting the port B and a port D from communicating with each other. The pressure within the chamber is increased to thereby increase the pressure within the pressure-regulating chamber. Consequently, a plug is urged by a piston to thereby inhibit the port A and a port C from communicating with each other, and permitting the port C and the port D to communicate with each other. Inversely, when the three-way solenoid valve connects the pressure-regulating chamber to the high-pressure chamber, the plug is urged by a piston to thereby inhibit the port A and the port B from communicating with each other, and permitting the port B and the port D to communicate with each other. The pressure within the chamber is reduced to thereby reduce the pressure within the pressure-regulating chamber. Consequently, the plug is urged by the high pressure to thereby permitting the port A and the port C to communicate with each other, while inhibiting the port C and the port D from communicating with each other. This makes it unnecessary to cause leakage of the refrigerant to reduce pressures within the pressure-regulating chambers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a four-way switching valve, and more particularly to a four-way switching valve which carries out switching of refrigerant lines when the cooling and heating operation mode is switched in a heat pump-type heating and cooling system for an automotive vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a heating and cooling system for an automotive vehicle, a refrigerating cycle is employed when cooling operation is performed, and when heating operation is performed, engine coolant is used as a heat source. Recently, however, due to the improvement in combustion efficiency of the engine, the temperature of the coolant does not rise high enough to obtain sufficient heating temperature in winter. For this reason, there is an increasing need for a system which can perform both cooling and heating. In a heating and cooling system of this kind, it is necessary to reverse the direction of flow of a refrigerant flowing through an internal heat exchanger and an external heat exchanger, as the system is switched between cooling and heating operations. The flow of the refrigerant is switched by a four-way switching valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the arrangement of a heating and cooling system using the four-way switching valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The heating and cooling system is comprised of a compressor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a four-way switching valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an external heat exchanger <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a decompressor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and an accumulator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The four-way switching valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes four ports A to D. The port A of the four-way switching valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to a delivery side of the compressor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the port B is connected to the external heat exchanger <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the port C is connected to the internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and port D is connected to the accumulator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> During the cooling operation, the four-way switching valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is switched such that the port A and the port B is communicated with each other and the port C and the port D is communicated with each other, as indicated by solid lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Therefore, a high-temperature and high-pressure refrigerant compressed by the compressor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is guided into the port A of the four-way switching valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and sent from the port B to the external heat exchanger <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, where the refrigerant is caused to undergo heat exchange and condensed, and then by the decompressor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the refrigerant is adiabatically expanded to a low-temperature and low-pressure refrigerant. The internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> causes the low-temperature and low-pressure refrigerant to undergo heat exchange with warm air in the vehicle cabin and evaporate. Then, the refrigerant flows through the port C and the port D of the four-way switching valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to enter the accumulator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, where it is caused to undergo gas/liquid separation, followed by returning to the compressor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, during the heating operation, the four-way switching valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is switched such that the port A and the port C is communicated with each other and the port B and the port D is communicated with each other, as indicated by broken lines in the figure. Therefore, the high-temperature and high-pressure refrigerant compressed by the compressor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is sent through the port A and the port C of the four-way switching valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, to enter the internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, where it is caused to undergo heat exchange with cool air in the vehicle cabin to heat the same. The refrigerant condensed by the internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is adiabatically expanded by the decompressor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the low-temperature and low-pressure refrigerant. Then, the external heat exchanger <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> causes the refrigerant to undergo heat exchange to evaporate, and then the refrigerant is guided through the port B and the port D to flow into the accumulator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, where it is caused to undergo gas/liquid separation, followed by returning to the compressor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As described above, the four-way-switching valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can switch the operation mode of the heating and cooling system, by changing over the flow path of refrigerant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As the four-way switching valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, there has been proposed a four-way switching valve in Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-183291 filed by the present applicant. The four-way switching valve is configured such that a first valve and a third valve for opening and closing passages from a port A into which a high-pressure refrigerant is introduced, to a port B or a port C, and a second valve and a fourth valve for opening and closing passages from the port B or the port C to a low-pressure port D are made separate and independent. The first valve and the second valve, and the third valve and the fourth valve are driven by a first piston and a second piston, respectively, and at the same time two solenoid valves are provided for selectively guiding part of the high-pressure refrigerant introduced into the port A, to pressure-regulating chambers for the first and second pistons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This enables the two solenoid valves to guide a high-pressure fluid in the port A into the pressure-regulating chamber for the first piston or that for the second piston in a switching manner, thereby making it possible to switch between a first state in which the port A is communicated with the port B, and the port C is communicated with the port D, and a second state in which the port A is communicated with the port C, and the port B is communicated with the port D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, although the conventional four-way switching valve is configured such that the high-pressure refrigerant is selectively introduced into one of the respective pressure-regulating chambers for the first and second pistons to thereby drive the first to fourth valves, the pressure of one of the chambers into which the high-pressure refrigerant is not introduced is reduced by leaking it to the low-pressure port D via a corresponding one of respective clearances between the first and second positions and the cylinders for accommodating the pistons, whereby the first or second piston is returned to a switching position thereof in the first or second state. Therefore, the four-way switching valve suffers from the problem that the leakage of refrigerant from the pressure-regulating chambers to the low-pressure port D results in degraded refrigerating power of the heating and cooling system, although the amount of leakage is very small. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The chamber b communicating with the port B is connected to the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via a tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such that the chamber b communicates with the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Further, the four-way switching valve includes a three-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for causing the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to selectively communicate with either a chamber a into which a high-pressure refrigerant is introduced or a chamber d communicating with the low-pressure port D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The three-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> includes a plunger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which has balls, serving as valve elements, fixed to axially opposite ends thereof, and a core <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which has a passage formed therethrough along an axis thereof and a valve seat formed at a position opposed to one of the balls fixed to the plunger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The passage formed though the core <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is connected to the low-pressure chamber d by a tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that it communicates with the chamber d. Arranged outside the plunger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the opposite side of the core <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is a casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which has a valve seat formed in an inner wall thereof opposed to the other of the balls fixed to the plunger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on a side remote from the core <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The valve seat has a valve hole connected to the high-pressure chamber a by a tube <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such that the valve hole communicates with the chamber a. Further, the plunger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is urged by a spring in a direction away from the core <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, that is, in a direction in which the ball is seated on the valve seat of the casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a periphery formed with a plurality of axially-extending communication grooves which allow the opposite end sides of the plunger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, having the respective balls fixed thereto, to communicate with each other. The space allowing communicating between the above opposite end face sides is communicated with the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> via the casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a tube <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the four-way switching valve constructed as above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when the three-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is in a deenergized state, i.e. in the solenoid-deenergized state, the plunger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the three-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is urged by the spring, whereby a passage connected to the tube <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is blocked while the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the tube <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are communicated with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> At this time, the pressure within the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is reduced since the chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is communicated with the chamber d communicating with the low-pressure port D, via the three-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the port A is supplied with the high-pressure refrigerant, so that the plug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are pressed and moved upward as viewed in the figures, and the plug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is seated on the annular projection of the plug <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and is away from the annular projection of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. While this increases the pressure within the chamber b, the pressure within the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is also made as high as that within the chamber b due to simultaneous supply of the high pressure via the tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having a larger pressure-receiving area than that of the plug <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is pressed and moved downward as viewed in the figures, to cause the plug <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be seated on the annular projection of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and be away from the annular projection of the plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As a result, the port A is communicated with the port B, and the port C is communicated with the port D. In other words, the heating and cooling system for an automotive vehicle is placed in a cooling operation mode in which the high-pressure refrigerant discharged from the compressor and received via the port A is allowed to flow from the port B to the external heat exchanger, and the refrigerant discharged from the internal heat exchanger and received at the port C is allowed to flow from the port D to the compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, immediately after entering a solenoid-energized state of the three-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the plunger <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the three-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is attracted to the core <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, so that the valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> blocks the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> communicating with the chamber d and causes the high-pressure chamber a and the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to communicate with each other. As a result, the high-pressure refrigerant in the chamber a is introduced into the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by way of the three-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, whereby the piston <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is pressed and moved downward as viewed in the figures. At the same time, the plug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as well is pressed and moved downward to be inserted into a valve hole communicating with the high-pressure chamber a, so that it becomes difficult for the high-pressure refrigerant to flow from the chamber a to the chamber b to thereby reduce the pressure in the chamber b. As the pressure in the chamber b is reduced, the pressure in the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is also reduced by reduced supply of the high pressure refrigerant via the tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, so that the plug <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are pressed and moved upward as viewed in the figures, by the high-pressure refrigerant in the chamber a. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The axially opposite end portions of each of the plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> form guides which are slidably fitted or inserted into respective valve holes associated therewith to guide the axial movements of the plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The guides on the axially opposite ends of the respective plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed to have respective lengths large enough to prevent the both of the respective guides of the plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from being simultaneously drawn out from the associated valve holes by the axial movements of the plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the above switching operation is carried out by the three-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, one of the valve holes arranged opposed to the plug <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is switched from a closed state to an open state thereof whereas the other of the valve holes is switched from an open state to a closed state thereof. When the plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are located at respective intermediate positions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, both of the valve holes are closed at the same time, and when the respective plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are located at positions other than the intermediate positions, one of the opposite valve holes is necessarily closed. Therefore, the high-pressure refrigerant in the chamber a is inhibited from directly flowing out into the low-pressure chamber d. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Then, the plug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are pressed and moved downward as viewed in the figures until the plug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is seated on the annular projection of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, while the plug <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are pressed and moved upward as viewed in the figure until the plug <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is seated on the annular projection of the plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the resulting state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the port A is communicated with the port C, and the port B is communicated with the port D. That is, the heating and cooling system for an automotive vehicle is switched to a heating operation mode in which the high-pressure refrigerant delivered from the compressor and received via the port A is allowed to flow from the port C to the internal heat exchanger, and the refrigerant discharged from the external heat exchanger and received via the port B is allowed to flow from the port D to the compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As described hereinabove, as the operation mode is switched, the three-way solenoid valve <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> introduces the high-pressure refrigerant into the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and allows the refrigerant from the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to flow into the low-pressure chamber d, whereby it is possible to dispense with a mechanism which always causes the refrigerant to leak from the pistons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to reduce pressure in the pressure-regulating chambers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The four-way switching valve according to the sixth embodiment employs balls <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as valve elements in place of the plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the four-way switching valve according to the first embodiment. The balls <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> have axial movements thereof guided on axially opposite sides by plugs <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and plugs <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, respectively, all of which are arranged in a manner inserted into associated valve holes, respectively. The plugs <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and plugs <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> each have a hollow cylindrical portion slidable on the inner wall of an associated one of the valve hole, and the hollow cylindrical portion is formed with an opening in the form of a hole or a slit. Thus, each of the valve holes is placed in a communicating state when an associated one of the balls <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is moved in a direction away from one of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the plugs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> serving as its valve seat. By using the balls <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as valve elements, the four-way switching valve can be easily applied to changeover of a refrigerant flow path between passages having a very large differential pressure, e.g. in a case where carbon dioxide is employed as the refrigerant. Moreover, since the balls <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are supported in a state pressed from the axially opposite sides thereof, and can be slightly moved when seated on the valve seats, it is possible to automatically carry out alignment adjustment when the valve holes are closed, thereby enhancing the sealing performance. </paragraph>

This causes a high-pressure refrigerant to flow into the chamber b via the plug <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and then flow into the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by way of the tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, so that the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pressed and moved downward as viewed in the figure until the ball <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> closes the valve hole of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As a result, the port A is communicated with the port B via the plug <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and the port C is communicated with the port D via the port <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, whereby the heating and cooling system for an automotive vehicle is switched to the cooling operation mode. </paragraph>

This causes the piston <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be pressed and moved downward as viewed in the figures, whereby the ball <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> closes the associated valve hole of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the pressure-regulating chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is communicated with the low-pressure chamber d via the tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the plug <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>.

It should be noted that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, component parts and elements similar or equivalent to those of the four-way switching valve shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are designated by identical reference numerals, and detailed description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The four-way switching valve according to the seventh embodiment is configured such that a passage through which flows a high-temperature and high-pressure refrigerant compressed by the compressor is thermally insulated from a passage through which flows a low-temperature and low-pressure refrigerant adiabatically expanded. More specifically, in the cooling operation mode, the chamber a communicating with the port A and the chamber b communicating with the port B are used as the passage through which the high-temperature and high-pressure refrigerant flows, while the chamber c communicating with the port C and the chamber d communicating with the port D are used as the passages through which the low-temperature and low-pressure refrigerant flows. The chambers a and b and the chambers c and d are arranged adjacent to each other within the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the case of the four-way switching valve applied to the heating and cooling system for an automotive vehicle, the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed by using an aluminum material for weight reduction purpose. Since aluminum has a high thermal conductivity, the passage for the high-temperature refrigerant and the passage for the low-temperature refrigerant exchange heat with each other, via the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> separating them, resulting in a degraded operating efficiency of the refrigerating cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> To overcome the problem, in the four-way switching valve according to the seventh embodiment, plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>each serving as the valve element and guide, and plugs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>each serving as the valve seat therefor are formed by a material or materials having a lower thermal conductivity than that of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When the difference between the pressures of the refrigerant is not large, a resin is used as the material having a lower thermal conductivity, whereas when the difference is very large, a stainless steel, for instance, is suitable for the plugs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Further, fitted in passages where the plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are arranged are sleeves <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, respectively, which have a lower thermal conductivity. The plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>have large-diameter portions which have outer peripheries thereof in contact with the insides of the sleeves <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, respectively, such that the plugs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be axially moved. As a result, in the case of the system being in the operation mode shown in the figure, when the high-temperature refrigerant passes through the chamber b, the sleeve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the plug <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>prevent the refrigerant from flowing toward the plug <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and when the low-temperature refrigerant passes through the chamber c, the sleeve <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the plug <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>prevent the refrigerant from flowing toward a partition wall between the chambers a and c. The above construction is provided not for completely preventing the refrigerant from intruding toward the plug <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the partition wall between the chambers a and c, but for largely suppressing heat conduction to the plug <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the partition wall between the chambers a and c by blocking vortices generated by the refrigerant rapidly flowing through the chambers b and c, from flowing to the plug <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the partition wall between the chambers a and C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As described hereinabove, the insides of the refrigerant passages through which the refrigerant flows in opposite directions depending on the operation mode i.e. the insides of the chambers b and c are surrounded by members having a lower thermal conductivity than that of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, for thermal insulation of the chambers b and c. This makes it possible to eliminate heat exchange between chambers having different temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Further, when the system is in the operation mode shown in the figure, the high-temperature refrigerant flows though the chamber b, while the low-temperature refrigerant flows through the chamber c adjacent thereto, and therefore a thickness-reducing hole <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is provided so as to reduce heat conduction through the partition wall between the chambers b and c. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> This makes the heat of the high-temperature refrigerant introduced into the chamber a difficult to directly transfer to the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, due to reduction of heat conduction to the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the absolute quantity of heat transmitted to the low-temperature chamber d via the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reduced, and heat conduction from the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is blocked by the sleeves <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> arranged on the high-temperature sides of the respective chambers d. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As described heretofore, the four-way switching valve according to the invention is comprised of two three-way switching valves arranged side by side, each of which has a pressure-regulating chamber, a piston, and a plug forming a valve element, coaxially arranged. One of the pressure-regulating chambers is selectively communicated with a low-pressure chamber or a high-pressure chamber by a three-way solenoid valve, and the other of the pressure-regulating chambers is communicated with a chamber pressure within which is increased or reduced as pressure within the one of the pressure-regulating chambers is decreased or increased. As a result, when the pressure within one of the pressure-regulating chambers is decreased or increased, that within the other of the pressure-regulating chambers can be increased or decreased, so that it is possible to prevent leakage of the refrigerant by separating the pressure-regulating chambers from the low-pressure chamber by using sealing members. This makes it possible to prevent degradation of refrigerating power of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the present invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and applications shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be regarded as falling within the scope of the invention in the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
