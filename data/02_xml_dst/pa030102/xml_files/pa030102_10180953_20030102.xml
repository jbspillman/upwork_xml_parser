<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a vehicle seat, in particular a motor vehicle seat, which can be reconfigured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the case of a known vehicle seat which can be reconfigured, in order to bring about a table position, the backrest structure is folded onto the seat framework in such a manner that the rear side of the backrest is aligned horizontally. If this increase in the loading area is not sufficient, the vehicle seat can be removed in its entirety. A vehicle seat of this type still leaves something to be desired in practice. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention is the provision of improvements to a motor vehicle seat which can be reconfigured to bring about a table position, so that it can be further transferred into a floor position. In accordance with this aspect, an articulated seat framework is operative for being articularly downwardly folded to transfer the seat from the table position into the floor position, and thereafter operative for being articularly upwardly unfolded to transfer the seat from the floor position into the table position. In accordance with this aspect, the seat framework has a front foot region and at least one diagonal strut, and at least one locking device is mounted for releasably locking the diagonal strut to the front foot region. The seat is restricted from being transferred from the table position into the floor position while the diagonal strut is locked by the locking device. On the other hand, the seat can be transferred from the table position into the floor position while the diagonal strut is not locked by the locking device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the vehicle seat can be transferred from the seat position into the table position and/or the floor position by moving the seat framework and/or the backrest structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the diagonal strut being locked releasably to the front foot region, i.e. the releasable locking device being provided which locks the diagonal strut and the front foot region to each other, the shape of the seat framework, and therefore the position of the vehicle seat, can be changed in a simple manner. The locked diagonal strut preferably holds the seat framework in a dimensionally stable manner. On the other hand, when the diagonal strut is unlocked, the seat framework, which is designed, for example, as a four-bar linkage, can be folded up, in particular can be folded substantially flat. A floor position of this type means that the vehicle seat no longer has to be removed in order to increase the loading area. The front foot region preferably has a guide for a controlled movement of the diagonal strut. Preferably, one diagonal strut is provided on each side of the vehicle seat in order to distribute the forces symmetrically, the two diagonal struts being connected to each other for stability reasons by means of at least one common, horizontal crosspiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a preferred design, in order to lock the diagonal strut, a retaining hook is provided in the front foot region. That is, the locking device includes a retaining hook. The retaining hook at least partially engages, preferably in a form-fitting manner, around a bar portion (e.g., bolt and/or a crosspiece) of the diagonal strut. This bolt or this crosspiece preferably simultaneously forms the same component which is guided in that guide of the front foot region which is provided for the diagonal strut. The retaining hook, which, for example, is of pivotable design and is spring-loaded, can, for example, be removed from the bolt or the crosspiece manually by various unlocking elements, such as hand loops, pivotable levers or shafts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention is advantageous, in particular, for rear seat rows of a &ldquo;van&rdquo;. The flat, generally recessed floor position enables the loading area of the van to be greatly increased without the vehicle seat having to be removed. With the design according to the invention, a simple operation is provided. The invention may also be used for other type vehicles.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present inventions now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, these inventions may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The vehicle seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is designed as a rear seat of a motor vehicle, preferably for a third seat row of a &ldquo;van&rdquo;. As the seat part structure, the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a seat framework <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on which a backrest structure <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of a backrest is articulated by means of two aligned backrest pivot bolts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The seat framework <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> bears a seat cushion (not illustrated) in a manner known per se. On the left-hand side and on the right-hand side, with respect to the direction of travel, the seat framework <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has in each case a seat frame side part <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in which one of the backrest pivot bolts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in each case is mounted. The two seat frame side parts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are connected fixedly to each other in their front region by a front seat frame crosspiece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and in their rear region by a rear seat frame crosspiece <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, forming a seat frame. In the following, first of all the seat position of the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A respective front rocker <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is articulated by its upper end on both sides of the front seat frame crosspiece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The front rocker <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is articulated by its lower end on a front bearing bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> fixed on the vehicle structure. Preferably, the front rocker <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the front bearing bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> form a front foot region of the seat framework <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The two front rockers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are connected fixedly to each other by means of a rocker crosspiece <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In the rear region of each seat frame side part <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a rear rocker <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is articulated by its upper end on the rear seat frame crosspiece <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The rear rocker <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is articulated by its lower end on a rear bearing bracket <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> fixed on the vehicle structure. Fixed on the seat frame side parts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, in the region between the respective backrest pivot bolt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the rear seat frame crosspiece <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, are respective backrest locking means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which use hooks to lock the backrest locking bolts <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which are fixed on the backrest structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A respective diagonal strut <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is also articulated by its rear end on the rear seat frame crosspiece <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The two diagonal struts <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are connected to each other in the region of their front end by means of a load-carrying diagonal strut crosspiece <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and by means of a locking crosspiece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which is preferably designed as a rod. The locking crosspiece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is locked to the front bearing bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in a manner described in greater detail below. Each end of the locking crosspiece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is arranged in each case within a guide <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the associated front rocker <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The guide <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which is connected fixedly to the front rocker <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, is designed with a U-shaped profile and runs along the front rocker <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> perpendicularly with respect to the locking crosspiece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As a locking device, a retaining hook <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is mounted pivotably in each front bearing bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The retaining hook <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, by being acted upon by a leg spring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, at least partially engaging around the locking crosspiece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and locking it in a form-fitting manner. Furthermore, a projection <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> from which a driver bolt <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> protrudes laterally is mounted in the front bearing bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, with its pivot axis parallel to the retaining hook <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The driver bolt <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is engaged around by a driver clip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> which sits in a rotationally fixed manner on an unlocking crosspiece <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which is designed as a rod. The unlocking crosspiece <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is mounted at each of its two ends in a rotatable manner in one of the front bearing brackets <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Sitting on the unlocking crosspiece <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in a rotationally fixed manner at one end is an unlocking lever <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which is provided with an unlocking loop <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> which can be grasped manually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an elongated latch <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is mounted pivotably in each front bearing bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A tension spring <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, which engages on a pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> protruding laterally from the latch <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, prestresses the latch <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> toward a disk cam <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The disk cam <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is seated with respect to the front rocker <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in a rotationally fixed manner on a rocker bearing bolt <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> which forms the point of articulation of the front rocker <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the front bearing bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A connecting lever <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, which at one end surrounds the pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> by means of an elongated hole, is articulated by its other end on the unlocking lever <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Apart from the seat position described above, the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can also take up other positions. For the transfer into the &ldquo;table position&rdquo;, the backrest locking means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are unlocked thereby releasing the backrest locking bolt <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The backrest structure <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can then be folded forward round the backrest pivot bolt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> into an at least approximately horizontal position. The rear side of the backrest is then used as a loading area. In both positions mentioned, the seat framework <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is held in a dimensionally stable manner, i.e. immovably, by the locking of the locking crosspiece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the diagonal struts <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The selected arrangement of the diagonal struts <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> obliquely forward and downward means that in the event of a crash, the forces acting on the backrest are introduced into the vehicle structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> From the table position, for the transfer into the floor position or flat-floor position the unlocking loop <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is pulled by hand. The unlocking lever <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is used to rotate the unlocking crosspiece <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which moves the driver bolt <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> via the driver clip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. This causes the projection <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to pivot, said projection pressing against the retaining hook <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the latter pivots rearward and downward counter to the force of the leg spring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and thereby releases the locking crosspiece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. As a four-bar linkage, the seat framework <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can then be folded rearward in a substantially flat manner. In the process, the ends of the locking crosspiece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which are arranged and guided on the end side in the guides <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the front rockers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, slide along these guides, as a result of which the folding movement of the seat framework <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is guided. The disk cam <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is supported on the latch <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> by means of a lug <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>&prime; as soon as the floor position is reached. This secures the disk cam <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. In the floor position, the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stashed in a floor recess in such a manner that an increased loading area is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> For the return from the floor position into the table position of the vehicle seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the latch <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is first of all pivoted back via the unlocking loop <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the unlocking lever <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the connecting lever <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, with the result that the latch <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> releases the disk cam <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The seat framework <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is then pulled up by means of a pull-up loop <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> which is attached to a front rocker <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In the process, the ends of the locking crosspiece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> again slide along the guides <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the front rockers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in order to control the movement of the seat framework <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The retaining hooks <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which are provided with a run-on slope, engage around the locking crosspiece <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as soon as the latter has reached the lower end of the guides <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which end is positioned in the front bearing brackets <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The table position is thus reached again. For the transfer into the seat position, the backrest structure <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is folded upward until the backrest locking bolts <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> drop into the backrest locking means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
