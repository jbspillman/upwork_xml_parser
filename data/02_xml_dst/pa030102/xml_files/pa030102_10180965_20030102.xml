<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a wiring substrate having top-flattened solder bumps projecting from the main surface thereof, and to a method for manufacturing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A known wiring substrate includes a resin dielectric layer and a conductor layer formed in a predetermined pattern on the resin dielectric layer. An example of such a wiring substrate is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which is an enlarged partially broken away, sectional view of a substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and which shows a portion located on the side toward the main surface. The substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has a core substrate (resin dielectric layer) <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> at its center. One or more resin dielectric layers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are formed in layers on either side of the core substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and a solder resist layer (resin dielectric layer) <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is formed on the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> on one side of the core substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, thereby providing the main surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A plurality of substantially cylindrical through-hole conductors <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> are formed in the core substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> at predetermined positions and are filled with respective resin fillers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A plurality of through-holes <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> which enable the formation of vias are formed in the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> at predetermined positions, and via conductors <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> are formed in the corresponding through-holes <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. A plurality of openings <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> which provide exposure of respective pads <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are formed in the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> at predetermined positions. Further, a first conductor layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> including wiring lines and pads is formed in a predetermined pattern between the core substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and is connected to the through-hole conductors <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> formed in the core substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the via conductors <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> formed in the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In addition, a second conductor layer <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> including wiring lines and pads is formed in a predetermined pattern between the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and is connected to the via conductors <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. When a plurality of the resin dielectric layers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are formed, a conductor layer (not shown) is provided between the resin dielectric layers corresponding to layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, bumps are formed of, for example, solder or gold on the corresponding pads <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> formed in the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, so as to serve as terminals for electrical connection. Further, in order to ensure connection to an electronic component (e.g., an IC chip, a chip capacitor, a chip resistor, or the like) to be mounted on the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the bumps are flattened at their tops by use of a flat pressing surface, thereby forming top-flattened solder bumps corresponding to bump <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Because the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> uses a resin layer of substantially uniform thickness as the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, portions of the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> located above the first conductor layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> present between the core substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> rise slightly. In the course of forming the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is pressed while being heated, and thus the surface of the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is flattened to a certain extent. However, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> portion of the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> which is formed on a solid layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (which is a portion of the first conductor layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and extends over a certain area) unavoidably rises to a certain extent in relation to the remaining portion of the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. As a result, a first pad <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>B, which is located within a region which is formed by projecting the solid layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> toward the main surface (hereinafter simply referred to as a &ldquo;region above the solid layer&rdquo;) is formed at a raised position whereas a second pad <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>C is located outside the region above the solid layer. Thus, as represented by dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the solder bump <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>B formed on the first pad <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>B and the solder bump <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>C formed on the second pad <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>C are of the same size, but differ slightly in the position of the vertex, i.e., bump <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>B projects outwardly from substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> slightly more than bump <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>C. These solder bumps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>C are flattened at their tops through pressing, through the use of a common, flat pressing surface <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, and are thus formed into a first top-flattened solder bump <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>B and a second top-flattened solder bump <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>C, respectively. Since the difference in the positions of the vertices of the bumps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>C results in a difference in the amount of solder to be crushed in the course of the flattening process, the diameter M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the top face of the top-flattened solder bump <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>B is greater than the diameter M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the top face of the top-flattened solder bump <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>C. as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Actual measurements have revealed that a difference of 2 to 3 &mgr;m in positional height between the pads <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> leads to a difference of about 10 &mgr;m in top face diameter between the top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the connection terminals of an electronic component to be mounted on the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are formed in a very uniform fashion, and that the fact that the top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> differ in top face diameter can, in some cases, result in variations in connection accuracy among the connections when the electronic component is mounted on the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to provide an improved wiring substrate in which top-flattened solder bumps have substantially the same top face diameter irrespective of the presence of a solid layer, and to thereby improve the accuracy of the connections between the wiring substrate and an electronic component mounted thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing the improved wiring substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, in order to achieve the above objects, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a wiring substrate having a main surface, a back surface, and a plurality of top-flattened solder bumps projecting from the main surface. The method comprises the steps of: forming a solid layer on a core substrate so as to partially cover the core substrate; forming at least one resin dielectric layer on the solid layer and the core substrate; forming a plurality of pads on the resin dielectric layer in such a manner that the plurality of pads are exposed at the main surface of the wiring substrate, the pads including first pads located within a region above the solid layer and second pads located outside of the region; applying, through printing, solder paste onto the plurality of pads such that the amount of solder paste applied onto each of the first pads is smaller than that applied onto each of the second pads; melting the applied solder paste, through reflowing, so as to form substantially hemispherical solder bumps; and flattening top portions of the substantially hemispherical solder bumps through pressing of a flat pressing surface against the top portions, thereby forming the top-flattened solder bumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to an important feature of the present invention, solder paste is applied through printing onto a plurality of pads which are exposed at the main surface so that the solder paste can be applied thereto. Next, the applied solder paste is melted to obtain the substantially hemispherical solder bumps. Subsequently, the aforementioned flat pressing surface is pressed against top portions of the solder bumps so as to obtain the top-flattened solder bumps. Relative to the solder paste application step, each pad is classified as first pad or second pad in accordance with whether or not the pad is located within the region above the solid layer and, as indicated above, a pad is classified as first pad when the pad is located within the region above the solid layer, and as a second pad when the pad is located outside the region. A key feature is that the amount of solder paste applied onto the first pads is smaller than that of solder paste applied onto the second pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Generally, the overall thickness of a wiring substrate increases at a portion where a solid layer is sandwiched between layers, as compared with a portion where such a solid layer is absent. As a result, when solder bumps are to be top-flattened by use of a common flat pressing surface, the distance (vertical spacing) between the first pads and the flat pressing surface is shorter or smaller than that between the second pads and the flat pressing surface. In other words, after the flattening step, in terms of the height of a given solder bump above a corresponding pad, the solder bumps formed on the corresponding first pads are lower or shorter than those formed on the second pads. As a consequence, when solder paste is applied in the same amount onto both the first and second pads, because the solder bumps formed on the corresponding first pads are pressed downward to a greater extent than, and thus are shorter than, those formed on the second pads, the solder bumps formed on the first pads have a top face greater in diameter than the top face of the solder bumps formed on the second pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In contrast, according to the present invention, since the amount of the solder paste applied to each of the first pads is smaller than that of the solder paste applied onto each of the second pads, the solder bumps formed on the corresponding first pads are smaller in size than those formed on the second pads, thereby reducing the difference in top face diameter between first top-flattened solder bumps formed on the corresponding first pads and second top-flattened solder bumps formed on the corresponding second pads. Therefore, when an electronic component is mounted on a wiring substrate according to the present invention, the connection terminals of the electronic component are connected to the first pads and the second pads under similar conditions, irrespective of presence of the solid layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned resin dielectric layer may be formed of any resin so long as the resin has substrate insulating properties. Examples of such a resin include an epoxy resin, a BT resin, and a composite material formed from resin, and glass fiber or ceramic powder, such as a glass-epoxy composite material. The solid layer is a conductor layer provided between resin dielectric layers while extending over a certain area. The metal used to form the solder bumps may be selected as appropriate in accordance with, for example, the material for the connection terminals of an electronic component to be mounted on the wiring substrate. Examples of such a metal include a Pb&mdash;Sn solder such as 90Pb&mdash;10Sn, 95Pb&mdash;5Sn, and 40Pb&mdash;60Sn; a Sn&mdash;Sb solder; a Sn&mdash;Ag solder; a Sn&mdash;Ag&mdash;Cu solder; an Au&mdash;Ge solder; and an Au&mdash;Sn solder. The flat pressing surface is preferably formed by use of a metallic material such as steel, or a ceramic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Each pad can be implemented in various forms including, for example, a pad-on-via (wherein a pad is provided on a via), or a pad-off-via (wherein a pad is provided off a via). Pads of different forms may be present on the same wiring substrate. Each via may assume the form of a filled via, which is filled with plating metal and has a flat top face, or an unfilled via, which is not completely filled with plating metal and is depressed at a central portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The amount of solder paste to be applied onto a particular pad must be determined in consideration of the form of each pad and that of each via. For example, in the case of a pad associated with an unfilled via, the amount of solder paste depends on whether the pad is a pad-on-via or a pad-off-via. Certain wiring substrates may include pads of different areas (because of, e.g., openings of different diameters for exposure of the pads). Therefore, when the same wiring substrate includes pads of different forms or different sizes, the present invention must be applied to first and second pads of the same form and the same size, i.e., to first pads and to those second pads which are identical with the first pads in terms of form and size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the flattening step is adapted to form the top-flattened solder bumps such that the diameter of a top face of each of the first top-flattened solder bumps formed on the corresponding first pads is substantially equal to that of a top face of each of the second top-flattened solder bumps formed on the corresponding second pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, in the flattening step, the solder bumps are top-flattened such that the diameter of the top face of each first top-flattened solder bump formed on the corresponding first pad is substantially equal to that of the top face of each second top-flattened solder bump formed on the corresponding second pad. Therefore, in a subsequent step of mounting an electronic component on the wiring substrate, the first pads and the second pads are able to effect substantially the same state of connection to the connection terminals of the electronic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a printing mask is used in the solder paste application step and has first through-holes corresponding to the first pads, and second through-holes corresponding to the second pads, the first and second through-holes being formed such that the diameter of the first through-holes is smaller than that of the second through-holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to this aspect of the present invention, wherein the solder paste application step uses a printing mask having through-holes formed therein such that the diameter of through-holes corresponding to the first pads is smaller than that of through-holes corresponding to the second pads, even when solder paste is applied onto the first and second pads in a similar manner, the amount of solder paste to be applied onto each first pad through the printing mask is smaller than the amount of solder paste to be applied onto each second pad through the printing mask. Therefore, by virtue of the consequent reduction in the difference in top face diameter between top-flattened solder bumps that results from the presence or absence of a solid layer, there can be realized a reduction in the difference in quality of the connection between top-flattened solder bumps formed on the first pads and those formed on the second pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> If top-flattened solder bumps can be provided which have substantially the same top face diameter, regardless of the presence/absence of a solid layer, in a subsequent step of mounting an electronic component on the wiring substrate of the invention, the first pads and the second pads can realize or achieve substantially the same state of connection to the connection terminals of the electronic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> No particular limitation is imposed on the printing mask, so long as the printing mask has through-holes formed therein so as to allow solder paste to pass therethrough. Examples of such a printing mask include a screen mask, and a metal mask, i.e., a metal sheet, such as a stainless steel sheet, having holes formed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention a wiring substrate is provided having a main surface, a back surface, and a plurality of top-flattened solder bumps projecting from the main surface, the wiring substrate comprising a core substrate; a solid layer formed on the core substrate and partially covering the core substrate; at least one resin dielectric layer formed on the solid layer and the core substrate; a plurality of pads formed on the resin dielectric layer and exposed from the main surface, the pads including first pads located within a region above the solid layer and second pads located outside of the region; and first top-flattened solder bumps formed on the corresponding first pads and second top-flattened solder bumps formed on the corresponding second pads. The diameter of a top face of each of the first top-flattened solder bumps is substantially equal to that of a top face of each of the second top-flattened solder bumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The wiring substrate of the present invention is configured such that solder bumps formed on the corresponding pads on the main surface assume substantially the same top face diameter irrespective of presence of the solid layer. Therefore, in a subsequent step in the manufacture of the wiring substrate in accordance with this aspect of the invention wherein an electronic component is mounted on the wiring substrate, the first pads and the second pads can achieve or realize substantially the same state of connection to the connection terminals of the electronic component. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> One preferred embodiment of the present invention will next be described in detail with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an enlarged partially broken away, sectional view of a substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, showing a portion located on the side toward the main surface. The substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a main surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an unillustrated back surface, and is of a substantially rectangular, substantially platelike or planar shape. The substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes, at its center, a substantially platelike core substrate (resin dielectric layer) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is advantageously formed of a composite material of glass fiber cloth impregnated with epoxy resin and in an exemplary implementation has a thickness of about 600 &mgr;m.

The solder resist layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> each having a preferred diameter of about 120 &mgr;m formed therein at predetermined positions in such a manner as to extend through the same, so as to provide exposure of pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A first conductor layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which includes a solid layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> extending over a certain area, is formed between the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and is connected to the through-hole conductors <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed in the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and to the via conductors <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed in the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A second conductor layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> including wiring lines and pads is formed in a predetermined pattern between the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and is connected to the via conductors <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed in the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> portion of the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which overlies the solid layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a thickness substantially equal to that of a portion of the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in direct contact with the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the height of the upper surface of the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> above the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as measured within the region above the solid layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is greater than that measured outside the region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Parts of pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C (collectively referred to as pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) formed between the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are exposed through the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> formed in the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, so as to enable mounting an electronic component such an IC chip on the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A nickel plating layer (not shown) is formed on the surface of each of these pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in order to prevent oxidation, and a gold plating layer (not shown) is formed on the surface of the nickel plating layer. Since the upper surface of the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is raised within the region above the solid layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a first pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B formed within the region is located at a height above the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> greater than that at which a second pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C formed outside the region is located. It will be appreciated that while only a single pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B and a single pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C are shown, the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of these pads and thus the pads will be referred to in the plural. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Solder bumps are formed on a plurality of pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and project from the main surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the substrate, such that first top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B are formed on the corresponding first pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B, and second top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C are formed on the corresponding second pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. The top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C are preferably formed of 40Pb&mdash;60Sn solder, and each covers the entire surface of each of the pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. The first top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B are lower in height and smaller in volume than the second top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C, and project from the main surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> a smaller amount than do the second top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C. However, since the height above the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the first pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B is greater than that of the second pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C, the top faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B of the first top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B and the top faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>C of the second top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C lie in substantially the same plane. The top faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>C are flat and have a diameter of about 105 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is manufactured in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, by use of known processes, the through-hole conductors <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed in the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the first conductor layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> including the solid layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed in a predetermined pattern on the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the through-hole conductors <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are filled with the resin filler material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Next, the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is placed on the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and on the first conductor layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a copper foil, preferably having a thickness of about 5 &mgr;m, is placed on the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The resultant assembly is pressed while being heated, thereby forming the copper-clad resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and on the first conductor layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A plurality of through-holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> used in the formation of vias are formed in the copper-clad resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at predetermined positions by use of, for example, laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Next, also by use of known processes, the substantially columnar via conductors <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed in the corresponding through-holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the second conductor layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed in a predetermined pattern on the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Then, the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed on the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and on the second conductor layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> such that the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are formed therein so as to provide exposure of pads. Subsequently, a nickel plating layer (not shown) is formed on the pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> exposed through the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> formed in the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in order to prevent oxidation, and a gold plating layer (not shown) is formed on the nickel plating layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Next, in the solder paste application step, a (e.g., 40Pb&mdash;60Sn) solder paste <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is applied onto the pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Specifically, a printing mask <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is placed on the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then the solder paste <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is applied onto the printing mask <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by use of a squeegee (not shown). The solder paste <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> passes through through-holes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> formed in the printing mask <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and adheres to the pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The printing mask <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed of a stainless sheet into a substantially rectangular shape similar to that for the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and has the through-holes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> formed therein at positions corresponding to the positions of the pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The diameter D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of first through-holes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B corresponding to the first pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B, which are formed within the region above the solid layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, is smaller than the diameter D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of second through-holes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C corresponding to the second pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C, which are formed outside the region. In an exemplary embodiment, the diameter D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first through-holes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B is about 130 &mgr;m, and the diameter D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the second through-holes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C is about 150 &mgr;m. As a result, the amount of the solder paste <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be applied to each first pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B is smaller than that of the solder paste <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be applied to each second pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Next, in a reflow step, the applied solder paste <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is melted, thereby forming substantially hemispherical solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). When the solder paste <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is melted, the molten solder paste <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> assumes a substantially hemispherical shape because of surface tension, thereby resulting in the substantially hemispherical solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Since the amount of solder paste <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> applied to each of the first pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B is smaller than that of the solder paste applied to each of the second pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the first solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B formed on the corresponding first pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B are smaller in volume than the second solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C formed on the corresponding second pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C, and the height of the first solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B above the first pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B is lower than that of the second solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C above the second pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, in the flattening step, the solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are top-flattened by pressing a flat pressing surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of a presser tool <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> against top portions thereof, thereby forming top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). For example, through the use of a flattening apparatus utilizing an air press (not shown) for pressing the flat pressing surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> against the solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are top-flattened at a pressing force of about 75 kg to 100 kg. At this time, the pressing surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may be heated so as to facilitate deformation of the solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> through application of heat in the course of the pressing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, since the solid layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is present underneath, in the pressure applied state, the distance T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the pressing surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the first pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B becomes less than the distance T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the pressing surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the second pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. However, since the first solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B formed on the corresponding first pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B are smaller in volume than the second solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C formed on the corresponding second pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C, and the height of the first solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B above the first pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B is lower than that of the second solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C above the second pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C, there is a reduction in the difference in the amount of solder to be crushed or flattened by the pressing surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> between the first solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B and the second solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C. Therefore, there is a reduction in the difference between the diameter L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the top faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B of the first top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B formed from the first solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B and the diameter L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the top faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>C of the second top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C formed from the second solder bumps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is noted that through appropriate adjustment of the diameters of the first and second through-holes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C formed in the printing mask <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the diameter L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the top faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B of the first top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B and the diameter L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the top faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>C of the second top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C can have substantially the same value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Thus is completed the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The diameters of the top faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> were measured, and the following diameter-related data were obtained from measured values of diameter: average 105.4 &mgr;m; maximum 133.9 &mgr;m; minimum 74.4 &mgr;m; range 59.5 &mgr;m; and standard deviation 8.1. In the case of the conventional substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the following diameter-related data were obtained: average 118.9 &mgr;m; maximum 182.9 &mgr;m; minimum 62.9 &mgr;m; range 120.0 &mgr;m; and standard deviation 10.4. As is apparent from the data, the present invention provides an improvement in terms of range and standard deviation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described with reference to a presently preferred embodiment, the present invention is not limited thereto, but may be modified as appropriate without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> For example, the above embodiment is described in reference to the via conductors <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the filled via type formed in the through-holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. However, bowl-shaped (unfilled via type) via conductors, whose central portion is depressed, may also be employed. In this case, pads of the same type (pad-on-via type or pad-off-via type) are classified into the first pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B and the second pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C in accordance with the presence/absence of a solid layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described embodiment, in classification of each pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as either a first pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B or a second pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C, the sole factor considered is whether or not the pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is located within the region above the solid layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. However, for example, each pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can also be classified in accordance with whether or not an end portion of the solid layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a wiring line, or a like element is present under the pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this case, the diameter of the through-holes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> formed in the printing mask <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be modified according to individual classification conditions of the pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so that the top faces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the top-flattened solder bumps <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can assume higher uniformity in terms of diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is also noted that the above embodiment has been described in reference to the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is configured such that a single resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. However, a plurality of resin dielectric layers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be formed between the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the solder resist layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the present invention is applicable even when the solid layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed between the resin dielectric layers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> instead of being formed between the core substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the resin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described above in relation to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that variations and modifications can be effected in these preferred embodiments without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
