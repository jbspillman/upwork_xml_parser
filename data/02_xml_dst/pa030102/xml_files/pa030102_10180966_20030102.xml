<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such an apparatus is known from Dutch patent NL 1001697. Although the known apparatus in itself is reasonably satisfactory, there is a need for a machine having a higher capacity, where the risk of damage to the products is reduced still further. The roller conveyor used in the known apparatus has the disadvantage that it conveys incompletely filled rows of products to the delivery element. As a result, the container is not filled with complete rows, so that the products P are yet to be displaced within the container. Such displacement may entail damages. When such displacement is not done in the container, the container H will not be optimally filled with products P. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To solve these problems, the apparatus according to the invention is characterized by the features of claim 1. The invention also provides a method according to claim 25 to resolve the above-described problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The vibrating feeder provides for the formation of completely filled rows of products which are taken over in rows by the intermediate conveyor, which proceeds to transfer each time a completely filled row to the delivery element. As a result of the presence of the vibrating feeder, the container is filled with complete rows of products, so that the products do not need to move within the container anymore to fill up &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in the product pattern already present in the container. Moreover, the apparatus according to the invention provides the possibility of processing products having mutually considerably different dimensions. In particular when the products are natural products, such as, for instance, apples, paprikas or like fruits or vegetable products, this property is of particularly great importance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To still further improve the delivery of the products by the delivery element into the container, according to a further elaboration of the invention, adjacent a delivery end of the delivery element, a positioning device is connected with the delivery element, which positioning device is provided with a V-shaped receiving cavity for receiving a row of products which has been delivered by the delivery element, the V-shaped receiving cavity being rotatable about an axis extending in horizontal direction. It is then preferred that an open side of the V-shaped receiving cavity is closable with the aid of a guard, which guard is rotatable about a second axis concentric with the first axis. It is then recommended to operatively tune the rotation of the V-shaped cavity and the guard to each other, such that when filling the V-shaped cavity with products and emptying it, the impacts sustained by the products are minimal. With the aid of the positioning device, a highly controlled delivery of products to the container is accomplished.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the present exemplary embodiment, the apparatus has an infeed end aligned with the discharge conveyor A of a fruit sorter, for instance of the type &ldquo;Calistar&rdquo; marketed by Aweta BV of Nootdorp, the Netherlands. The apparatus is intended to place products P, supplied by the discharge conveyor A, in a container H in a highly controlled manner. In the present exemplary embodiment, the containers are so-called dry bins having a substantially rectangular bottom and an open top. Connected to the discharge end of the discharge conveyor A is a vibrating feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The vibrating feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, at an outlet thereof, is provided with a threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extending slightly upwards, viewed in the conveying direction, on which threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> a row of products is formed. The threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> constitutes the connection between the vibrating feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and an intermediate conveyor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> arranged downstream of the vibrating feeder. The intermediate conveyor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> conveys the products to the delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with supporting elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which jointly define a number of supporting surfaces extending substantially in horizontal direction. In the present exemplary embodiment, the supporting elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected with two endless conveyors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such as, for instance, chains. The supporting elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from a single horizontal row are mutually connected via a flexible flap which forms a supporting surface on which the products P can rest. The supporting elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected with the respective conveyors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such that, in a descending part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the conveyors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, they assume an extended position in which the products can rest on the supporting elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and in an ascending part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the conveyors the supporting elements assume a collapsed position in which they abut against the ascending conveyor part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This provides the advantage that the delivery element can approach any of the walls of the container H very closely, so that when filling the container H the products need to traverse hardly any rolling path, if at all. Such a solution is known per se from Dutch patent application number <highlight><bold>1001697</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, presently, the vibrating feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the intermediate conveyor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will be described in more detail. The vibrating feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with a vibrating trough <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which, viewed in the conveying direction, is inclined downwards at a small angle &agr;, and which is provided with a support <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and an energization <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the form of a motor with an eccentric arranged to impose a high vibrating frequency of a small amplitude on the trough <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The vibrating trough <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is covered with damping material <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to prevent damage to the products during conveyance through the vibrating trough <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The angle &agr; is preferably in the range of from 1 to 10 degrees. The vibrating frequency is preferably in the range of from about 20 to about 100 Hz and the amplitude of the vibration is preferably in the range of from about 1 to about 4 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The intermediate conveyor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises an endless conveyor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is provided with fingers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> arranged in rows and extending substantially perpendicularly to the conveying surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is preferably of comb-shaped design, so that the fingers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be moved between the teeth of the comb-shaped threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> rests by a downstream end thereof on the endless conveyor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the length of the fingers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> arranged in rows is such that in use in each case one row of products P is carried along by the fingers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The intermediate conveyor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with a drive <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which is schematically represented, and a control <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the present exemplary embodiment, above the threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a series of sensors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is arranged for observing the presence of products P on the threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The sensors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the present exemplary embodiment are designed as optical sensors. It will be self-evident, however, that other types of sensors can be used as well. Thus, for instance, weighing cells can be disposed under the threshold plate to observe the presence or absence of products P on the threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The control <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is arranged for actuating the drive <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> each time when the sensors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> deliver a signal to the control <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> signifying that a complete row of products P has formed on the threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In the present exemplary embodiment, the endless conveyor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is tensioned around three rotation axes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Viewed in the conveying direction, a first, upstream upper part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the conveyor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, extending between a first and a second rotation axis <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, is upwardly inclined at a first angle &bgr; with the horizontal. A second upper part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, extending between the second and the third rotation axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, extends at a second angle &ggr; with the horizontal. The first angle &bgr; is preferably in the range of from about 5 to about 50 degrees. The second angle &ggr; is less critical but is preferably in the range of from about &minus;45 to about 45 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the invention is not limited to the above-described vibrating feeder and intermediate conveyor. Thus, the intermediate conveyor can also comprise a series of grippers by which the row of products formed by the vibrating feeder is picked up row by row. Options also include other forms of intermediate conveyors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> respectively show a side elevation and a sectional elevation taken on line V-V in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, but it is to be noted that the drawings are of a diagrammatic nature and that various parts have not been represented in the drawing for the purpose of clarity. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> clearly shows the delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is provided with two conveyors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between which extend the supporting elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The supporting elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as appears clearly from detail A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, are pivotally connected to the endless conveyor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Also, with each supporting element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a first end of a control rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected. The control rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a second end thereof pivotally connected to the respective endless conveyor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such that the angle which the respective supporting element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes with the horizontal in the descending part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the conveyor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the delivery end <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is maintained as long as possible. The delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is arranged so as to be movable up and down relative to the fixed world by means of a motor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Arranged under the delivery end <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a positioning device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is connected with delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The positioning device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provided with a V-shaped receiving cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for receiving a row of products P which has been delivered by the delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The V-shaped receiving cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is rotatable about a first axis <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extending in horizontal direction. The positioning device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is further provided with a guard <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by means of which an open side of the V-shaped receiving cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is closable. The guard <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotatable about a second axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is concentric with the first axis <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In use, the rotation of the V-shaped cavities <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the guard <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are tuned to each other, such that when filling the V-shaped cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with products E and emptying it, the impacts sustained by the products are minimal. In the present exemplary embodiment, the V-shaped cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is bounded by two rows of brush hairs or plates <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, arranged in a V-shape relative to each other and connected with a common first shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The guard <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprises two cylinder drum segments <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which cylinder drum segments <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are rotatable about the second axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows twelve positions successively assumed by the V-shaped cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the guard during pickup and delivery of a product. The successive figures clearly show that the products P are deposited in the container H in a highly controlled manner. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> only shows rotation of the V-shaped cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the guard <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in one direction, it will be clear that the V-shaped cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the guard <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can also be rotated in the other direction in order to position the products as closely as possible to the two opposite vertical walls of the container H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> represents an alternative embodiment of a positioning device, in which, instead of the guard <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, on opposite sides of the V-shaped cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, two brushes are disposed, extending parallel to the V-shaped cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Each brush <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is rotatable about an axis <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> extending parallel to the first axis <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Each brush <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> itself, in turn, has receiving cavities extending in the longitudinal direction of the brush, which are bounded by the brush hairs of the respective brush <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In use, the rotation of the brushes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the rotation of the V-shaped cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are tuned to each other, such that during the filling of the V-shaped cavity <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with products P and emptying it, the impacts sustained by the products P are minimal. For the purpose of apples, this effect is achieved by selecting the length of the legs of the V-shaped cavity in the range of 15-27 cm and by selecting the length of the circular arc included by the V-shaped cavity at the outer circumference thereof in the range of 17-22 cm. For other products, the length of the legs and the magnitude of the angle included by the legs can be varied to minimize the force of the impacts. The series of consecutive positions assumed by the V-shaped cavity and the neighboring brushes during the positioning of a product are represented in ten different positions of the delivery process in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In the series of figures, it is clearly visible that the products P sustain hardly any or no impact when being positioned in a container H. For the sake of clarity, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</cross-reference>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the right-hand brush <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the positioning device is not represented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a third embodiment of a positioning device according to a further elaboration of the invention, in six different positions assumed by this positioning device when placing a row of apples in the container H. In this exemplary embodiment, the positioning device comprises two rows of brushes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Each row of brushes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is connected with an associated rotation shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> being rotatable in opposite directions. Moreover, the rotation shafts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are arranged so as to be movable in vertical direction relative to the delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. From supporting elements <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> a row of products is placed on the brushes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> being in a closed position. Next, the rotation shafts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and hence the brushes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, move down, and the rotation shafts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and hence the brushes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, rotate such that the row of products P is delivered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The operation of the apparatus is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The products P are supplied more or less in a random manner by the discharge conveyor A of the product source, designed as a fruit sorter in the present exemplary embodiment. In the vibrating feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the products, due to the vibratory movement of the vibrating feeder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, are gradually conveyed to the comb-shaped threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As soon as a complete row of products P has formed on this threshold plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the intermediate conveyor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> takes over a complete row of products. From this intermediate conveyor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the products are transferred to the delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> conveys the products downwards and transfers them to the positioning device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. By means of the positioning device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the products P are placed in the container H in a controlled manner. When the container H is completely filled, it is removed by means of a supporting conveyor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. It is noted that during the filling of the container H the supporting conveyor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is used to displace the container H relative to the fixed world and hence relative to the delivery element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It will be clear that the invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiment described, but that various modifications are possible within the framework of the invention as defined by the claims. </paragraph>
