<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Plant for cooling preforms, comprising a collection and translation element provided with a plurality of receptacles adapted to accommodate respective preforms that are usually knocked out of an injection mould, a revolving-turret element with two opposite surfaces provided with a plurality of cups adapted to accommodate a respective preform; said turret revolves in a controlled manner about a horizontal axis so as to successively orientate the two surfaces upwards and downwards, and the collection and translation element can be displaced with a translational motion from a preform loading position selectively to a plurality of distinct positions, which lie above the surfaces of the turret when rotated upwards, and can engage and release the preforms from the respective receptacles. The distribution pattern of the receptacles is similar to the distribution pattern of the cups so as to enable the preforms to fall exactly into respective cups. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention refers to a high-output, high-productivity plant for the production of plastic items, ie. the so-called &ldquo;preforms&rdquo;, and in particular the present invention applies in a preferred manner to machines adapted for moulding at the same time a plurality of such socalled &ldquo;preforms&rdquo;, that are intended for processing by blow moulding into appropriate final containers, especially plastic bottles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> These machines for the final moulding or blow-moulding of said preforms are usually defined as &ldquo;single-step machines&rdquo; since they are adapted to carry out in a continuous and automatic manner the entire process for converting the plastic material, from the pelletized state thereof into the finished product, ie. the final containers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, it will be appreciated that the present invention shall be understood as applying also to other kinds of machines intended to only produced finished, but not blow-moulded preforms, since the teaching of the present invention is only aimed at increasing the productivity of the plants and the related preform production processes, regardless of the fact that these preforms are actually produced in a single-step plant or in a plant intended exclusively for the production of preforms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The difference existing between single-step and two-step machines is well-known to all those skilled in the art, so that it shall not be described or explained here any further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is generally known that the production of preforms involves the simultaneous utilization of a plurality of injection-moulding cavities, into which a flow of resin in its molten state is injected and which remain then closed for a given period of time as required to allow the preforms so formed in said mould cavities to appropriately cool down and, therefore, solidify. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> During this phase of cooling down and solidification of the preforms, the related injection moulds remain of course clamped and occupied, ie. not available for further use, so as to allow for such a cooling down, and they cannot therefore be used for subsequent phases of injection and cooling down of further clusters of preforms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Since the various process phases that are carried out by the plant must be performed in synchrony, each one of them must be carried out within the time interval needed by the longest phase, which usually determines the so-called &ldquo;cycle time&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is also a generally well-known fact that such a phase, which includes the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> closing or clamping the moulds, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> injecting the molten resin into the same moulds, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> cooling down said injected resin and consolidating the respective preforms, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> opening the moulds and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> removing or knocking out the preforms from the moulds, takes a time, ie. has a duration that is far longer than that of the other process phases carried out by the plant and, as a result, it is decisive in view of determining said cycle time and, therefore, it directly affects the actual productivity of the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Such a complete phase, however, can be appropriately broken down into its various, distinct sub-phases, each one of which is active, ie. goes on for a determined respective sub-period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Also generally well-known is the fact that the longest sub-period of time of said sub-phases is the one used for cooling down the preforms after the consolidation thereof, and it therefore is just natural for said complete phase to be divided into an orderly sequence of several sub-phases, which also said preform cooling-down sub-phase following the preform consolidation one belongs to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This of course enables a reduction in the original cycle time to be obtained, which in this way becomes the cycle time relating to said cooling-down sub-phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Such a solution is well-known in the art, eg. in the disclosure of the U.S. Pat. No. 4,382,905 to Valyi, and has been successively improved in a number of following patents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> However, the increasing pressure exerted in view of bringing about a further increase in the productivity of the injection moulds, along with the fact that such a cooling-down time, and therefore also the related cycle time, is anyway too long in view of the actual possibility of obtaining a satisfactory increase in productivity, has made it appropriate for the opportunity to be considered for such a preform cooling-down sub-phase following the preform consolidation one to be in turn subdivided into a plurality of elementary phases which of course need and take correspondingly reduced time lengths, with the result of a reduction in the cycle time and a corresponding increase in productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> However, the various attempts made in view of dividing the preform cooling-down phase by transferring the preforms from a proper mould to a succession of moulds, in which the temperature of the preforms is gradually reduced and brought down to a balanced state, have up to now failed to find any practical implementation owing to a number of reasons, such as in particular the complexity of the plant that would be required to this purpose, the considerable increase in the overall size and space requirements that would ensue therefrom and, under certain circumstances, also the fact that continuously handling still relatively hot preforms from a mould to another one all along a whole sequence of moulds is quite likely to bring about a reduction in the quality of the preforms themselves and, anyway, to more or less significantly damage them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Based on the above considerations, it is therefore desirable, and it is actually a main purpose of the present invention, to provide a plant and a respective process which are adapted to implement and carry out a preform cooling-down phase under a sensible reduction in the length of the original cycle time, are cdapable of doing away with the above described drawbacks, are reliable and capable of being easily implemented using readily available and, therefore, cost-effective materials and techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Such an aim of the present invention, along with further features thereof, is reached in a plant that is made and operates as recited in the appended claims.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With reference to the above listed Figures, a revolving turret plant according to the present invention comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> a load-bearing structure <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> a collection and translation element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> a plurality of receptacles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided in said collection and translation element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> a revolving turret <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, with two distinct opposite outer surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on which there are arranged two respective pluralities of cups <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> adapted to accommodate respective preforms; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> retaining and release means adapted to selectively retain and release the preforms inserted in said cups; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> means adapted to selectively engage the preforms inserted in their respective receptacles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and disengage them from said collection and translation element; devices <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> adapted to selectively rotate said revolving turret <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> about a horizontal axis X, so that said two opposite surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can alternately exchange their position, in particular upwards and downwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As this is illustrated in particular in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, said collection and translation element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided with means that make it adapted to perform a horizontal movement inserting it alternately into a preform injection-moulding machine (not shown) and into said load-bearing structure <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and, in particular, above said revolving turret <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Said receptacles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided in said element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are distributed according to the following geometric pattern: with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, said receptacles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are arranged along four rows, indicated at F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively, in which they are aligned and equally spaced from each other; furthermore, each row constitutes a single group of receptacles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Each row extends parallel to and equidistant by a distance D from the contiguous rows, in such a manner that the totality of the rows identifies a rectangular perimeter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in the Figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to be able to better develop the continuation of this description, the overall geometry defined by the totality of said receptacles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> included in all said rows of the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be defined as &ldquo;distribution pattern&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In an advantageous manner, and to the purpose of making the most out of the available space, each row, which is identical to, ie. is the same as the remaining ones, includes the highest possible number of receptacles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as allowed by the length of the same row, owing to reasons that will explained in a greater detail further on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the afore cited distance D separating contiguous rows of receptacles from each other must be equal to a multiple of the distance separating from each other the contiguous, parallel rows provided on the two opposite surfaces of the revolving turret; this is intended to make it possible for the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be able to be arranged into a plurality of distinct and selectively definable positions above said revolving turret. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Each row of receptacles of the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is therefore capable of arranging itself above a respective row of cups <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the revolving turret. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> This quite obviously allows the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to load all of the cups provided on said revolving turret by successive cycles, while each time unloading a successive load of preforms on to a different geometry or pattern of cups by simply displacing and arranging in the proper position said element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that the distribution pattern of the receptacles arranges itself exactly above successive geometries or patterns on the revolving turret. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Since the task of said receptacles is to: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> intercept the preforms released by appropriate means provided above said collection and translation element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> collect said preforms in an orderly manner and orientate them vertically, ie. with their neck portion or opening turned upwards, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> transfer them above said revolving turret, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> finally let them fall into the respective cup, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> said receptacles and, more generally, said element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are provided with appropriate means that are adapted to selectively retain said preforms from falling down and releasing them downwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In a preferred manner, said means are constituted by one or more guillotine-like devices constituted by two plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, ie. a first plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, called neck centring, which has twelve perforations <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a diameter that is slightly larger than the diameter of the neck of the preform, and is stationary, and a second moving plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, constituting the actual guillotine, which has twelve buttonhole-shaped apertures having a smaller width than the diameter of the preform neck and terminating with a hole that on the contrary has a larger diameter than the preform neck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is arranged on top and the plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is arranged below; the plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is stationary, whereas the plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is adapted to selectively slide against said upper plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the lower plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of buttonhole-shaped apertures, each one of which is formed so as to include a first portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, whose cross-section is such as to enable the body of the preform, but not the neck portion thereof to pass therethrough, and a second portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> whose cross-section is such as to enable the whole preform to pass therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In a preferred manner, in order to facilitate the falling preform to be intercepted and centered, the upper portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of said perforations <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the upper plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has an upward flared shape following a frustoconical pattern, as this is best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For reasons that will be better explained and understood later on in this description, it is of fundamental importance for pairs of upper and lower plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be provided and arranged in such a manner as to ensure that each such pair of plates corresponds to a same row of receptacles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; as a result, there will be provided as many pairs of plates as said rows are. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As far as the revolving turret <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is concerned, its task lies in reducing the temperature of the preforms that come out of the injection-moulding press. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> This turret is formed by a parallelepiped-shaped body on which there are arranged said two opposite surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, each one of which is provided with an equal number of cooling-down cups <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Each preform is contained individually in elements that are usually called &ldquo;cups&rdquo;, which must be changed whenever the type of preforms being produced is changed, since they perfectly replicate the contour of the preform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The cooling-down effect is obtained through the circulation of water at a low temperature around each such cup. Anyway, the means and the techniques used to implement such a circulation are well-known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Each one of said surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of cups arranged in such a manner and in such a number as to make it possible for them to be gathered into a variety of distinct, but geometrically similar &ldquo;distribution patterns&rdquo;, as better defined earlier in this description, which can be accommodated at the same time on the same surface. Each one of said surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, where the arrangement of the respective cups is shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As this clearly emerges from the same Figures, all of the rows forming said geometrical patterns are parallel with respect to each other and, furthermore, the whole area of the outer surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is occupied by respective cups, each one of which belongs to a same and single pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the described means, as well as other associated guiding, actuation, support means, or means that are anyway associated to the correct operation of the plant, and that are within the capabilities of those skilled in the art, are implemented in such a manner as to ensure that said collection element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is capable of moving from a position outside said structure to a plurality of selectively controlled positions located above one of said outer surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of said revolving turret in such a manner as to enable said distribution pattern of said collection and translation element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to move into selectively and exactly lying above the three distinct, different distribution patterns of the cups arranged on said outer surfaces. In this manner, the preforms that are released by said element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are able to fall by gravity exactly into their respective cups of a same distribution pattern thereof provided on said outer surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Said revolving turret is further provided of rotation members <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and associated devices so as to be able to be rotated by 180&deg; about an horizontal axis thereof that passes through the centre of the parallelepiped forming the turret itself, so that the surfaces of the turret are able to exactly exchange their respective positions, upwards and/or downwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the considerations that have already been made on the longer duration of the cooling-down time with respect to the duration of the actual injection-moulding process, those skilled in the art will now be fully capable of understanding the basic operating features of the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, it can be noticed that, in the two first phases represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, the preforms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which have just been moulded in and released by an appropriate injection moulding press <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, fall on to the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is appropriately displaced into its position outside the load-bearing structure <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Here the preforms are retained since it is actually the sole body of the preform, and not the neck portion thereof, that is able to pass through the guillotine. In fact, the preform gets inserted in the upper plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and, with its body, also in the portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which has such a diameter as to prevent the neck portion thereof to pass therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In this phase, the plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are of course arranged in such a manner as to ensure that the aperture <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> moves into a coaxial arrangement with respect to a corresponding portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The preform is facilitated in its getting inserted and centered in the respective aperture <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in that the latter is provided with an upward flared portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the following phase, which is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is displaced above the revolving turret, and namely in the position in which the distribution pattern of the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> lies vertically above one of the three distribution patterns provided on the outer surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that is in this moment oriented upwards. During the translation of said element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the preforms are retained laterally by both the guillotine and the neck centring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the subsequent phase illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the preforms are released from the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and fall by gravity into the respective cups <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Such a release of the preforms occurs by causing, by means of a plurality of appropriate actuators <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the lower plates <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to slide with respect to the upper plates <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in such a manner as to enable the apertures <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to move into a mating correspondence with respective enlarged portions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the corresponding lower plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The preforms, that are no longer retained by the neck portion thereof by the lower plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, are in this way able to fall and get exactly inserted in the respective cups <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the revolving turret, wherein said cups are arranged exactly according to the distribution pattern on the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The configuration of said plates and the still unreleased preforms is more clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, while the respective configuration with preforms being released is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The revolving turret is subsequently rotated by an angle of 180&deg; about the axis X, in such a manner as to enable the preform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> to move into the position indicated at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>; furthermore, during such a rotation, a second collection and insertion cycle is performed, similarly to the cycle illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, to so collect and insert a subsequent group of preforms, so that at the end of said second cycle there occurs a new insertion of preforms indicated at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B and this situation is completely illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, with the surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> now being turned downwards and the surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> upwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A third cycle of collection of preforms and rotation of the revolving turret <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is then carried out in exactly the same manner as the preceding cycle, including the rotation of the turret <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which therefore resumes its position with the surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> turned upwards, but with the difference that the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is displaced into a new position, above the turret, so as to come to lie exactly above the second distribution pattern of cups provided on the same surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This new situation is therefore illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, in which the just released preforms are indicated at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The above described process is repeated in exactly the similar way for such a number of times as to ensure that all of the six distribution patterns of cups on the two surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the revolving turret are successively filled by the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with respective preforms, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, and therefore for a total of six successive fillings thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Then, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the preforms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, which were the first ones to be loaded in the revolving turret, are released from the latter and fall by gravity on to collection means arranged below said turret (and not shown). Subsequently, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the turret rotates by a further angle of 180&deg; so that also the preforms indicated at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B are released therefrom, while the cups that have been cleared by the preforms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A are now situated upwards and are so made ready to accommodate a subsequent group of preforms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> At this point, the process goes on regularly on a continuous running basis, in the sense that each elementary cycle is performed to include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> a rotation by an angle of <highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight> of the turret, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> a release from the turret of a group of preforms, all of them belonging to the same distribution pattern, which had previously been loaded in the same turret in advance of the other ones, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> a loading in the turret, by said element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, of a new group of preforms according to a same distribution pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will therefore be able to readily appreciate that the described solution effectively enables a plurality of preforms, as appropriately gathered into a number of distinct distribution patterns, to be accommodated in a very limited space duly fitted for cooling down the same preforms. In fact, if the number of distribution patterns available on each surface of the turret is indicated as n, the total number of the various distribution patterns available on the two surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will be <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, and, if the total duration of the cooling-down phase of the preforms in the turret is for technical reasons pre-set at T, it will be obvious that it is possible for a release of preforms to be obtained every period T/<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> It is therefore to such a same period T/<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>that the time, ie. duration, of the elementary cycle including preform injection, solidification ad removal from the mould can be actually brought down to. Conversely, it is possible for the cooling down time to be proportionately increased, and such an increased time of cooling down of the preforms outside the mould enables the overall productivity of the plant to be effectively boosted owing to the preforms being actually knocked out of the mould in advance of the usual time, considering that a part of the terminal injection-moulding process, which includes exactly the preform cooling-down phase, is moved outside of the mould. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> However, the insertion of the preforms in the appropriate cups gives rise to the problem connected with the need for the same preforms to be firmly retained there when the revolving turret is rotated and the preforms themselves are therefore orientated downwards. In order to prevent these preforms to fall out in advance of the due moment, there is therefore provided an appropriate device comprising a first plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adapted to move and arrange itself between the neck portion of the preform and the respective cup, a second plane <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> carrying spring nails <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> actuating both said planes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> During preform insertion, this device is in the state as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, ie. with the preform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is just partially inserted in the respective cup <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, owing to any further insertion thereof being prevented by the contrast of said first plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the neck portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the preform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Immediately thereafter, in order to firmly retain the preform in its correct, fully inserted position in the cup <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, said first plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and said second plane <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are rotated and, therefore, brought close to each other by acting on said pneumatic cylinder, so that the preform is able to get fully inserted by gravity into the respective cup, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> At the same time, as said two planes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> move in such a manner relative to each other, said spring nails <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which are integral with or firmly joined to said second plane <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, dispose themselves in such a manner as to come to lie upon the neck portion of the respective preforms, so as to prevent them from accidentally or untimely falling down when turned upside down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> When the time then comes for said preforms, in said overturned position thereof, to be released from their respective cups, said pneumatic cylinder is operated in the reverse manner, so as: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> to clear the preform falling trajectory by moving the related spring nail <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> away, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> to release the preforms from the respective cups by means of the lever constituted by said first plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that pushes the neck portions <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the related preforms outwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, there is provided an appropriate evacuation apparatus to produce the vacuum that is used to retain each single preform in its own cup up to the moment of the ejection thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> All these devices operate as follows: after the preforms fall down from the revolving turret into the respective cups, means as generally well-known in the art are used to generate vacuum inside the cups so occupied by the preforms. This vacuum then enables the same cups, and therefore the respective preforms, to be turned upside down without any risk for the same preforms to slide by gravity out of the respective cups and fall so down in advance of the due time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In addition, the second plane <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is actuated so as to move it into arranging its spring nails <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in a position outside and in front of the aperture of the respective preforms, so that these preforms, should it accidentally happen that they fail to be retained by the so generated vacuum when turned upside down, would in any case be retained from falling down by said spring nails <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> At the pre-established moment, at which the by now cooled-down reforms are to be caused to fall down from the successive rows in the evolving turret, said pneumatic cylinder is operated so as to act on the afore mentioned two planes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> with the twofold result that, on the one side, said spring nails move to a position on the side of the preforms, thereby clearing the falling trajectory thereof, and, on the other side, said first plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, by acting as a lever on the surface of the neck portion thereof, pushes the preforms out of the respective cups, from which they fall then down by gravity, thereby completing their ejection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate such an ejection, the vacuum inside the cups of each row that is each time involved by this preform ejection operation, is eliminated by injecting low-pressure air into the respective cups; such an operation can on the other hand be most easily obtained through the use of means that are well-known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> An advantageous improvement can be further obtained if the revolving turret is provided with the possibility for it to move upwards and/or downwards in a controlled manner. The necessity must in fact be considered for the outer surfaces of the turret, which must receive the preforms, to be able to be brought as close as possible to the respective receptacles of the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so as to ensure an exact centring and insertion of the preforms themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> However, such a proximity may in fact constitute a hindrance to the free rotation of the revolving turret, since the latter is quite likely to so interfere with the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> thereabove or, more simply, with the preforms that protude downwards from said element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In view of doing away with such a drawback, appropriate means are therefore provided which, suitably connected to the axis of rotation of said turret, are adapted to cause it to rise or lower along the vertical in a controlled manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As synthetically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, these means may consist of an engagement element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> rotatably joined to, the rotating shaft of the revolving turret and capable of engaging a vertical worm screw <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> so as to be able to be actuated, upon appropriate command, so that the revolving turret can be raised and/or lowered in a manner that is fully independent of the remaining operations carried out by the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In this manner it is possible for the revolving turret to be lowered immediately upon its having been loaded with the preforms from a distinct distribution pattern, so that it is possible for the same turret to be rotated even before the collection and translation element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is displaced from its unloading position above the turret to its loading position in the injection-moulding press. The operating cycles and, therefore, the working times of the revolving turret can in this way be fully disengaged from the operating cycles and working times of the element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> It is therefore possible for the individual operation cycles to be optimized and, in conclusion, the overall productivity of the plant to be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> It shall of course be appreciated that the above described means are to be intended as preferred ones and do not preclude the utilization of means of a different kind or nature to so rise and lower the rotation shaft of the turret, as these may actually be quite easily found, developed and implemented by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
