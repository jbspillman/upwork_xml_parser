<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the forming of large parts from titanium. More particularly, it relates to the forming of such parts with external dimensions of the order of meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Superplastic forming of titanium involves heating titanium sheet to a specified temperature (usually in the region of 950 degrees centigrade) and blow forming the heated titanium by using an inert gas, such as argon. This process is usually performed in either an industrial press or a furnace. However, the finite dimensions of these two items impose restrictions on the size of the parts that can be superplastically formed within them. Consequently, parts too large to be accommodated in existing presses or furnaces have to be fabricated from two or more smaller sections that have been superplastically formed individually. This increases both the time and cost associated with the forming of large parts from titanium. Furthermore, it may lead to dimensional inaccuracies in the finished part owing to its fabrication from a number of smaller constituent sections: unacceptably large dimensional variations resulting from the aggregate of the normal individual dimensional variations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,209,093 discloses apparatus for superplastically forming large cylindrical structures, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (i) a generally cylindrical ceramic die having a radially inwardly facing surface defining the contours of a structure to be formed from a cylindrically rolled metal sheet positioned radially inwardly therefrom; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (ii) radiant heating means positioned radially inwardly of the rolled metal sheet for heating a medial portion thereof to a predetermined temperature at which it achieves a superplastic condition; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (iii) means for introducing a pressurised gas to force the medial portion of the rolled metal sheet radially outwardly against the ceramic die when the medial portion of the rolled metal sheet has been heated to a superplastic condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The ceramic die may be formed of segments that mate along radial planes, for example 120 degree segments. This allows the die to be disassembled to enable removal of titanium structures formed therein which cannot be removed in any other way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Radiant heating means tend to heat indiscriminately any object that lies in the path of radiation emitted from the heating means. Although this will result in the desired heating of the rolled metal sheet if the sheet is in the path of the emitted radiation, it may also result in objects being unnecessarily heated, such as the die or end portions of the apparatus. As a consequence, a greater amount of energy will be needed to operate the radiant heating means than would be the case if only the rolled metal sheet were heated. A corollary of this is that, for any given operating power of the heating means, the rolled metal sheet will take longer to reach the required temperature under the action of radiant heating means than would be the case if only the rolled metal sheet were heated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to address these disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of this invention there is provided a method of superplastically forming large parts from titanium, comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> a) constructing a furnace, the inside surface of the furnace being contoured and finished so as to form a mould for the part to be superplastically formed; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> b) introducing a substantially unformed titanium blank into the furnace; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> c) heating the titanium blank to the required temperature for superplastic forming; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> d) applying inert gas to the surface of the titanium blank furthermost from the surface of the mould, wherein the gas pressure is such that it causes the titanium blank to deform and take up the shape of the mould, thereby forming the required part, characterised in that the heating is by one or more electrical induction coils positioned on the side of the titanium blank furthermost from the mould such that the or each induction coil induces a current in the titanium blank which is heated thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The substantially unformed blank may be substantially cylindrical and the or each induction coil may be positioned inside said substantially cylindrical blank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The or each induction coil may be orientated such that its axis is substantially parallel to the axis of said substantially cylindrical blank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> There may be a plurality of such induction coils, the induction coils being distributed so that collectively they define an annulus that is substantially coaxial with the substantially cylindrical blank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of this invention there is provided apparatus for superplastically forming large parts from titanium comprising: a furnace having an interior, the inside surface of the furnace being contoured and finished so as to form a mould for the part to be superplastically formed; means for heating the interior of the furnace; and a supply of an inert gas, wherein the surface of the mould is adapted to receive a substantially unformed titanium blank, the heating means is adapted to heat the titanium blank to the required temperature for superplastic forming when that titanium blank is positioned in the furnace for superplastic forming in the mould, and the supply of the inert gas is operable to exert a pressure onto the surface of the titanium blank furthermost from the surface of the mould when that titanium blank is positioned in the furnace for superplastic forming in the mould such that the inert gas causes the titanium blank to deform and take up the shape of the mould, thereby forming the required part, characterised in that the heating means include one or more electrical induction coils positioned in the furnace so as to be on the side of the titanium blank furthermost from the mould when that titanium blank is positioned in the furnace for superplastic forming in the mould, such that the or each induction coil induces a current in the titanium blank which is heated thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The or each induction coil may extend the full height of the surface of the mould. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The substantially unformed blank may be substantially cylindrical and the or each induction coil may be positioned inside said substantially cylindrical blank when that titanium blank is positioned in the furnace for superplastic forming in the mould. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The or each induction coil may be orientated such that its axis is substantially parallel to the axis of said substantially cylindrical blank when that titanium blank is positioned in the furnace for superplastic forming in the mould. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> There may be a plurality of such induction coils, the induction coils being distributed so that collectively they define an annulus that is substantially coaxial with the substantially cylindrical blank when that titanium blank is positioned in the furnace for superplastic forming in the mould. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The contoured inside of the furnace surface may be formed of a ceramic material. The contoured inside of the furnace surface may be formed of a metallic or nonmetallic material that may be magnetiseable or non-magnetiseable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The furnace may be constructed of a plurality of furnace walls or furnace wall sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The inert gas may be argon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To assist the deformation of the titanium blank under the action of the inert gas, a vacuum may be applied to the side of the blank that is adjacent the mould. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The titanium blank may be partially formed, before it is introduced into the furnace.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> show a cylindrical furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is constructed predominantly from three furnace wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, each moulded from the same ceramic material. Collectively, the three sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> form the curved surfaces of a cylinder whose longitudinal axis lies vertically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The inside surface of the cylinder formed by the three ceramic wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shaped and finished so as to form a mould suitable for forming titanium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rests on a base plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which in turn is situated on legs <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The centre of the base plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a lower argon gas inlet aperture <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is connected to a controllable supply of argon gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also shows a heating assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This assembly consists of a circular top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> with a central top aperture <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and several induction coils. The induction coils are attached to the underside of the top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and are orientated so as to lie vertically and are circumferentially spaced from one another so as to form a circular array that is coaxial with the circular top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The induction coils themselves are not shown, but each of them has a support member <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, of which two are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. An annular bottom plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is attached to the lower end of the support members <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and is also coaxial with the top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The heating assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be inserted into and withdrawn from the cylindrical furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the heating assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> inserted into the furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this position, the top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the heating assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> rests on and is coaxial with the cylinder formed by the three ceramic wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The induction coils extend the full height of the inside surface of the sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The method of operation is described now with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A substantially unformed titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (in the form of a cylinder fabricated from a length of titanium sheet) is placed around the annulus defined by the induction coils. The positioning of the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> relative to the heating assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is such that the top edge of the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> contacts an O-ring seal situated in the top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the heating assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the bottom edge of the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> contacts an O-ring seal situated in the bottom plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the heating assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the O-ring seal <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> included in the top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. This provides airtight contact between this plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A similar arrangement is included in the bottom plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the top edge of the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in contact with the top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, it is envisaged that, when the blank is at ambient temperature, a gap should exist between the top edge of the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to allow for thermal expansion of the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The heating assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are then inserted into the centre of the furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To facilitate this insertion, two of the ceramic wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are pivotably mounted, thereby serving as doors to the furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This arrangement is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the pivotably mounted sections being labelled <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Closing the two doors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>causes the top and bottom edges of the inside surface of all three ceramic sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to abut the top and bottom edges respectively of the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The inclusion of seals <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in the top and bottom edge of the inside surfaces of the sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides for an airtight contact against the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. This completes the arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is firmly held in position by the airtight abutment of the three circular sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on its outside surface and the airtight abutment of the top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and bottom plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on its inside surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Argon gas is introduced into the furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the lower aperture <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the base plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The argon gas replaces air that was previously inside the furnace by forcing that air out of the top aperture <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The top aperture <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is then closed by any known means, such as a bung or a cut-off valve, and the introduction of argon gas is ceased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The electrical induction coils are then operated. A current flows in each coil and this results in a respective associated magnetic field being set up around the coil. The current in each coil is in the same direction, thus causing each respective field to be orientated in the same direction. As a result, a substantially toroidal magnetic field is set up around the annular arrangement of the coils. Magnetic flux of this field passes, in an axial direction, through the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that is adjacent and surrounds the annular arrangement of the coils, thereby causing a current to be induced in the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. This induced current results in the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> being heated. Positioning the annular arrangement of coils inside the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> does not optimise the induction heating effect of the coils as far as heating the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is concerned. This is because the flux density outside the annular arrangement of coils is less than the flux density inside the annular arrangement of coils. Positioning the annular arrangement of coils inside the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> therefore puts the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in a weaker part of the field. However, by positioning the annular arrangement of coils inside the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, it is possible to more accurately predict how the titanium blank will be heated, as each of the coils is at a known and easily verifiable distance from the surface of the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the coils may be more easily replaced in the event of failure, or altered in order to achieve different heating characteristics. One such alteration may be to move some of the turns of one or more coils apart and others of the turns of the or each coil together, in order to achieve a different heating profile of the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Using induction is advantageous as compared with using radiant heating means. Induction coils may be used to avoid heating parts of the apparatus that need not be heated, for example the circular top plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> or the base plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, if such parts are fabricated from non-magnetiseable material. The use of induction coils therefore results in improved efficiency and a shorter heating time for any given operating power of the induction coils. A shorter heating time is advantageous in reducing the thermal stress to which components of the apparatus are subjected. This may result in prolonging the useful life of the components, or in the use of cheaper components. For example conventional O-ring seals may be used to provide a gas-tight seal whilst permitting movement of the blank due to thermal expansion. It will be appreciated that high temperature, mechanical-type seals may hinder such expansion and increase the likelihood of the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> buckling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Once the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has been heated to the required temperature for superplastic forming, more argon gas is introduced into the furnace via the aperture <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This is continued such that the pressure of the argon on the inside surface of the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is greater than the pressure against the outside surface of the blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the two spaces being sealed from one another in an airtight fashion as previously described. This pressure difference causes the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to deform outwards and take up the shape of the mould comprised of the inside surface of the three ceramic sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. To further increase the pressure difference across the two surfaces of the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, it is envisaged that a vacuum may be applied to the outside surface of the titanium blank <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Techniques for achieving this are known to the skilled addressee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The heating is then stopped, allowing the superplastically formed part to cool prior to removal from the furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the heating apparatus <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the furnace wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are not pivotably mounted. Instead, the furnace wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are surrounded by a cylindrical outer wall <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The cylindrical outer wall <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is coaxial with the wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and has an internal diameter that is greater than the external diameter of the wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are in mutual abutment, there is an annular space <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> between the wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the cylindrical outer wall <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Six actuators <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, only three of which are shown, are mounted on the outer surface of the outer cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A pair of actuators <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are provided for each wall section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>: an upper actuator <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a lower actuator <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Each pair of actuators <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are positioned so that their lines of action pass radially through a respective one of the wall sections. Each actuator includes an actuator rod <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. The actuator rods <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of each pair of actuators <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> pass through the cylindrical outer wall <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and mechanically engage the respective wall section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Operation of the actuators <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> causes the wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be moved radially between a position in which they are in mutual abutment and a position in which they are spaced apart. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in mutual abutment. It will be appreciated that the heating and forming operations would be performed in this position. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the wall sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> spaced apart. It will be appreciated that it is in this position that the titanium blank would be inserted into the furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the heating assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (not shown) would be inserted into and withdrawn from the furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the formed titanium part (not shown) would be withdrawn from the furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
