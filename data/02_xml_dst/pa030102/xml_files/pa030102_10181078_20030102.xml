<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to methods pertaining to cell reselection in a cellular telecommunication system. Especially, the invention is related to such a method as specified in the preamble of the first independent method claim. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For clarification of common terms used in this document, an overview of certain cellular telecommunication system configurations is presented in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Proposals for third-generation systems include UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) and FPLMTS/IMT-2000 (Future Public Land Mobile Telecommunications System/International Mobile Telecommunications at 2000 MHz). In these plans cells are categorised according to their size and characteristics into pico-, nano-, micro- and macrocells, and an example of the service level is the bit rate. The bit rate is the highest in picocells and the lowest in macrocells. The cells may overlap partially or completely and there may be different terminals so that not all terminals necessarily are able to utilise all the service levels offered by the cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a version of a future cellular radio system which is not entirely new compared with the known GSM system but which includes both known elements and completely new elements. In current cellular radio systems the bottleneck that prevents more advanced services from being offered to the terminals comprises the radio access network RAN which includes the base stations and base station controllers. The core network of a cellular radio system comprises mobile services switching centres (MSC), other network elements (in GSM, e.g. SGSN and GGSN, i.e. Serving GPRS Support Node and Gateway GPRS Support node, where GPRS stands for General Packet Radio Service) and the related transmission systems. According e.g. to the GSM&plus; specifications developed from GSM the core network can also provide new services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the core network of a cellular radio system <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> comprises a core network CN <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> which has three parallel radio access networks linked to it. Of those, networks <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>933</bold></highlight> are UMTS radio access networks and network <highlight><bold>934</bold></highlight> is a GSM radio access network. The upper UMTS radio access network <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> is e.g. a commercial radio access network, owned by a telecommunications operator offering mobile services, which equally serves all subscribers of said telecommunications operator. The lower UMTS radio access network <highlight><bold>933</bold></highlight> is e.g. private and owned e.g. by a company in whose premises said radio access network operates. Typically the cells of the private radio access network <highlight><bold>933</bold></highlight> are nano- and/or picocells in which only terminals of the employees of said company can operate. All three radio access networks may have cells of different sizes offering different types of services. Additionally, cells of all three radio access networks <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>933</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>934</bold></highlight> may overlap either entirely or in part. The bit rate used at a given moment of time depends, among other things, on the radio path conditions, characteristics of the services used, regional overall capacity of the cellular system and the capacity needs of other users. The new types of radio access networks mentioned above are called generic radio access networks (GRAN). Such a network can co-operate with different types of fixed core networks CN and especially with the GPRS network of the GSM system. The generic radio access network (GRAN) can be defined as a set of base stations (BS) and radio network controllers (RNC) that are capable of communicating with each other using signaling messages. Below, the generic radio access network will be called in short a radio network GRAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The terminal <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is preferably a so-called dual-mode terminal that can serve either as a second-generation GSM terminal or as a third-generation UMTS terminal according to what kind of services are available at each particular location and what the user&apos;s communication needs are. It may also be a multimode terminal that can function as terminal of several different communications systems according to need and the services available. Radio access networks and services available to the user are specified in a subscriber identity module <highlight><bold>936</bold></highlight> (SIM) connected to the terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A conventional way to treat a connection setup request in a congestion situation is to simply reject the connection setup request. Thereafter the mobile station (MS) needs to find a new cell for a new connection attempt. The problem with this approach is a high amount of failed signalling, if the mobile station needs to make several connection attempts to several different cells before finding a cell, which accepts the new connection. Such a situation may arise, when many of the surrounding cells are congested as well. The setup of the connection can therefore also take a long time, which may frustrate the user of the mobile station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One other prior art way of treating a connection setup request congestion situation is to perform the connection setup as requested by the mobile station, and directly thereafter force a handover to a less congested cell. Such a method is quite satisfactory from the viewpoint of the user of the mobile station, since the network accepts the new connection quickly, but such a method causes too much signalling in the form of handover signalling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> At the time of writing this patent application, the RRC specifications of third generation cellular networks the network has no explicit control over which cell the UE selects after an RRC connection setup is rejected in the serving cell. It has also been a problem in the GSM system that after the rejection of signaling connection request, cell reselection and reattempt actions of mobile stations have not been under control of the network. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to realize a cell reselection method, which requires only a small amount of signalling. A further object of the invention is to realize a cell reselection method, which allows the network to have some control over the actions of the mobile stations in a connection rejection situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The objects are reached by indicating information affecting the determination of at least one parameter for a new connection attempt in a connection setup rejection message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The channel reselection signalling method in a cellular telecommunications network according to the invention is characterized by that, what is specified in the characterizing part of the independent claim directed to a channel reselection signalling method in a cellular telecommunications network. The channel reselection method in a mobile communication means of a cellular telecommunication system according to the invention is characterized by that, what is specified in the characterizing part of the independent claim directed to a channel reselection method in a mobile communication means of a cellular telecommunication system. The network element according to the invention is characterized by that, what is specified in the characterizing part of the independent claim directed to a network element. The dependent claims describe further advantageous embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a connection setup rejection message is used to direct a mobile communication means to attempt a new connection with certain parameter values such as a certain carrier frequency. A plurality of parameter values may as well be indicated in the message, which allows the network to direct the mobile communication means to make a connection setup request to a specific cell, for example. The connection setup rejection message can be for example the CONNECTION SETUP REJECT message of the RRC protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one advantageous embodiment, the network indicates a carrier frequency in the connection setup rejection message. After receiving the message, the mobile communication means attempts to set up a new connection to a cell which uses the carrier frequency. There may be more than one such cell. For example, in the WCDMA cellular system under development a plurality of cells may use the same carrier frequency. In such a case, the mobile station needs to select one of the cells for the new attempt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a further advantageous embodiment, the network indicates a carrier frequency and information identifying a certaing cell among the cells using the indicated carrier frequency. Such information identifying a certain cell can advantageously be for example a scrambling code corresponding to the cell. Since these parameters define a certain cell, the mobile station does not need to select one cell among those using the carrier frequency, which shortens the time needed for setting up the desired connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a still further advantageous embodiment of the invention, the network indicates a cellular network identifier in the rejection message. This embodiment is advantageous in those cases, when more than one cellular network exists in the same geographical area and the mobile communication means is capable of using at least two, even plurality of different networks. For example, this embodiment allows a UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) network to direct a mobile station to make a connection attept to a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) network to a GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) network, to a EDGE-capable (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution) network, or to some other network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The network may also indicate other parameters in the rejection message, such as for example parameter values for certain timers affecting the timing of the next connection attempt, time difference of the cell transmitting the rejection message and the cell suggested by the network, and parameter values identifying certain transmission channels to use. Parameter values for certain transmission channels can be for example parameter values describing a certain primary common pilot channel (CPICH) if the desired connection is a FDD (frequency division duplex) mode connection of the WCDMA system or a certain primary common control physical channel (CCPCH) if the desired connection is a TDD (time division duplex) mode connection of the WCDMA system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, the mobile communication means obtains at least one parameter value from a system information message, if the rejection message indicates a certain cause of rejection. For example, if the rejection message indicates that the cause is congestion, the mobile communication means can obtain a carrier frequency from a system information message for the next connection attempt. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, such a system information message is a System Info Block Type <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> message of the RRC protocol according to certain specifications of the WCDMA system.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Although a congestion situation typically arises because of shortage in the resources of a whole cell, a congestion situation may as well arise because of shortage in the radio resources of a channel, such as too many users in the channel. A connection rejection message may result from channel congestion as well. Therefore, in the following explanation and especially in the claims the term channel is used to cover a cell as well as a specific channel according to specific frequency, code, etc. parameters. As a handover can mean a change of certain connection parameters such as code or frequency as well as change of the connection from a first cell to a second cell, the selection of a new channel similarly can refer to a change of a certain connection parameter such as code or frequency as well as change of the cell. Channel selection can mean, for example, selection of a new frequency in the same cell or a different cell, selection of a new cell with the same or a different frequency, selection of a different scrambling or channel code on the same or different frequency in the same or different cell, or selection of even another cellular telecommunication system. Further, the term mobile station is intended to cover any mobile communication means. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The invention has several advantages. For example, the invention reduces signalling between a mobile telecommunication means and a network. No handover signalling is needed, as new information for setting up a new connection can be informed to the mobile in a rejection message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The invention is applicable in many different cellular telecommunication systems, such as the UMTS system or the GSM system. The invention is applicable in any such cellular telecommunication system, in which the cellular telecommunication network sends a rejection message as a response to a connection setup request from a mobile station, if the network is unable to provide the requested connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The name of a given functional entity, such as the radio network controller, is often different in the context of different cellular telecommunication systems. For example, in the GSM system the functional entity corresponding to a radio network controller (RNC) is the base station controller (BSC). Therefore, the term radio network controller in the claims is intended to cover all corresponding functional entities regardless of the term used for the entity in the particular cellular telecommunication system. Further, the various message names such as the CONNECTION SETUP REJECT message name are intended to be examples only, and the invention is not limited to using the message names recited in this specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing description it will be evident to a person skilled in the art that various modifications may be made within the scope of the invention. While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described in detail, it should be apparent that many modifications and variations thereto are possible, all of which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
