<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A data carrier (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) for contactless communication with a communication station (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) has an integrated circuit (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and has a direct voltage generation circuit (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>), and has detection means (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) for detecting a temperature prevailing in the data carrier (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and in the integrated circuit (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), with the aid of which detection means (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) a representation signal (RS) representative of the prevailing temperature can be generated, which representation signal causes an initiation of a change of the temperature in the data carrier (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and in the integrated circuit (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a data carrier for the contactless communication with a communication station designed for this, and to a communication station for the contactless communication with a data carrier designed for this, as well as to an integrated circuit for a data carrier for the contactless communication with a communication station designed for this. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such a data carrier and such an integrated circuit as well as such a communication station are described in, for example, the patent document WO 99/57681 A1 and are consequently known. The known data carrier has an integrated circuit by means of which, in addition to other circuit sections, a direct voltage generation circuit is realized, which circuit includes a rectifier stage further includes voltage limiting means, with the aid of which the d.c. supply voltage which can be generated with the aid of the direct voltage generation circuit can be limited to a maximum value, when necessary. Such a limitation is necessary, for example, when a data carrier is situated close to a communication station and is thus situated in an area with a high field strength of a communication fields that can be generated by the communication station, because in the absence of the voltage limiting means the high field strength would result in an excessive d.c. supply voltage on the output of the direct voltage generation circuit. The operation of the direct voltage generation circuit and, particularly, the operation of the voltage limiting means leads to generation of heat in the known data carrier, which results in a temperature rise in the known data carrier. Such a temperature rise has only comparatively insignificant consequences when the integrated circuit, by means of which both the direct voltage generation circuit and the voltage limiting means are realized, has a comparatively large surface area and can therefore handle comparatively large temperature rises. However, such temperature rises pose a problem when an integrated circuit for a data carrier adapted to provide contactless communication with a communication station is miniaturized to a higher degree than in the case of the aforementioned prior-art solution, i.e. is to be realized on a smaller chip area, because as a result of such temperature rises there is a risk that at least a part of the integrated circuit is damaged or even destroyed owing to excessively high temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to preclude the risk of adverse effects on a data carrier and on an integrated circuit in the case of further miniaturization of the data carrier and of the integrated circuit even in operational situations in which comparatively large temperature variations occur during operation, which without the provision of the measures in accordance with the invention would lead to operating temperatures outside a given permissible range of operating temperatures in the data carrier and in the integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the aforementioned object, characteristic features in accordance with the invention are provided in a data carrier in accordance with the invention, in such a manner that a data carrier in accordance with the invention can be characterized in the manner defined hereinafter, namely: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A data carrier adapted to provide contactless communication with a communication station and including an integrated circuit and including a direct voltage generation circuit, which serves to generate and to supply a d.c. supply voltage for the data carrier, and including detection means for detecting the temperature prevailing in the environment of the detection means in the data carrier, with the aid of which detection means a representation signal representative of the prevailing temperature can be generated, and including initiation means adapted to receive and to process the representation signal and adapted to initiate a change of the temperature in the data carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the aforementioned object, characteristic features in accordance with the invention are provided in an integrated circuit in accordance with the invention, in such a manner that an integrated circuit in accordance with the invention can be characterized in the manner defined hereinafter, namely: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An integrated circuit for a data carrier for providing contactless communication with a communication station, including a direct voltage generation circuit, which serves to generate and to supply a d.c. supply voltage for the integrated circuit, and including detection means for detecting the temperature prevailing in the environment of the detection means in the integrated circuit, with the aid of which detection means a representation signal representative of the prevailing temperature can be generated, and including initiation means adapted to receive and to process the representation signal and adapted to initiate a change of the temperature in the integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As a result of the provision of the characteristic features in accordance with the invention it is achieved in a comparatively simple manner and with only low additional cost that the temperature in a data carrier and in an integrated circuit for such a data carrier can be changed, i.e. increased or reduced depending on the situation, so as to keep the operating temperature in the data carrier and the integrated circuit within a desired specified range of operating temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a data carrier in accordance with the invention and in an integrated circuit in accordance with the invention the initiation means may be adapted to initiate a temperature increase, which may be required for example when a data carrier in accordance with the invention and an integrated circuit in accordance with the invention should operate correctly in deep-freeze environment. However, it has proved to be particularly advantageous when the initiation means are adapted to initiate a reduction of the temperature in the data carrier and in the integrated circuit. This is of particular advantage because in a number of uses of a data carrier and an integrated circuit for such a data carrier a comparatively strong heating may occur, particularly when the integrated circuit should be realized on a minimal chip area, an undesired temperature rise then being precluded with the aid of the measures in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a data carrier in accordance with the invention and in an integrated circuit in accordance with the invention the temperature can be influenced with the aid of an input resistance of an input circuit because the energy received and further processed by a data carrier in the range of operation in which a temperature change, for example a temperature rise, is possible, is proportional to the input resistance of an input circuit and can consequently the energy input can be changed by changing the input resistance, which results in a change of the temperature in the data carrier and in the integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a data carrier in accordance with the invention and in an integrated circuit in accordance with the invention it is also possible to use a transmission resonant circuit, provided in such a data carrier for receiving a communication signal transmitted to the data carrier by a communication station, for changing the temperature, which is possible because the energy input by means of such a transmission resonant circuit depends on the resonant frequency of the transmission resonant circuit, as a result of which the energy input into a data carrier can be changed in a comparatively simple manner by changing the resonant frequency of the transmission resonant circuit, which leads to a change of the temperature prevailing in the data carrier and in its integrated circuit. For changing the resonant frequency of the transmission resonant circuit use can be made of capacitors which can be switched into and out of the transmission resonant circuit. Changing the resonant frequency may alternatively be effected by switching inductances into or out of the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, with a data carrier in accordance with the invention and an integrated circuit in accordance with the invention it has also proved to be very advantageous when the initiation means are adapted to support the transmission of a transmission signal, which corresponds to the representation signal representative of the temperature prevailing in the data carrier and in the integrated circuit, from the data carrier to a communication station. This embodiment has the advantage that the change of the temperature prevailing in the data carrier and in the integrated circuit is initiated in the data carrier and in the integrated circuit but that the means for changing the temperature in the data carrier and in the integrated circuit are not included in the data carrier or the integrated circuit but in the communication station which is adapted to provide contactless communication with the data carrier and the integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the above context it has proved to be very advantageous when a communication station in accordance with the invention includes station processing means for processing the transmission signal transmitted by the data carrier and received by the communication station and further includes control means which can be influenced by the station processing means and with the aid of which the energy content of a communication signal transmitted from the communication station to the data carrier can be changed. This has the advantage that the measures for changing the temperature in a data carrier in accordance with the invention and in an integrated circuit in accordance with the invention are implemented in the communication station in accordance with the invention, which has the advantage that, if required, substantially more expensive and more intricate means and measures for changing the temperature in a data carrier and in an integrated circuit can be realized in a comparatively cheap manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned as well as further aspects of the invention will become apparent from the embodiments described hereinafter by way of example and will be elucidated with reference to these examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the drawings, which show four embodiments which are given by way of example but to which the invention is not limited. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> adapted to provide contactless communication with a communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a station data processing device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which includes a station control unit, which is realized by means of a microcomputer but which may alternatively be formed by a hard-wired logic circuit. The communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> further includes transmitting and receiving means <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connected to the station data processing device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as a result of which it is possible to transmit data from the station data processing device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the transmitting and receiving means <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as well as from the transmitting and receiving means <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the station data processing device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> further includes a station transmission coil <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the transmitting and receiving means <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and with the aid of which a contactless communication with a transmission coil of the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is possible, this contactless communication being effected in an inductive manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a transmission coil <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which serves to and is adapted cooperate inductively with the station transmission coil <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> further includes an integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has a first terminal <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and second terminal <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The transmission coil <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is connected to the two terminals <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> includes a capacitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arranged in parallel with the two terminals <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The capacitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> forms a main component of a transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> serves to receive a communication signal AMCS, the communication signal AMCS being an amplitude-modulated communication signal. The transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is tuned to a resonant frequency, which in known manner corresponds at least substantially to the frequency of a carrier signal which can be generated in the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and which is amplitude-modulated for the purpose of data transmission, as a result of which said amplitude-modulated communication signal AMCS is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> includes amplitude demodulation means connected to the transmission coil <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The amplitude demodulation means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> enable the received amplitude-modulated communication signal AMCS to be demodulated, the amplitude demodulation means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> supplying a demodulated communication signal DCS after a demodulation. The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> further includes decoding means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which are arranged after the amplitude demodulation means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to which the demodulated communication signal DCS can be applied and which decode this signal, as a result of which the decoding means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can supply a decoded signal DS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> further includes a data processing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which includes a control unit, which is not shown and which is realized with the aid of a microcomputer but which may alternatively be realized by means of a hard-wired logic circuit. The decoded signal supplied by the decoding means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be applied to the data processing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in order to be processed in the data processing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The data processing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> cooperates with a memory MEM, the data processing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the control unit included in said device enabling data to be read into the memory MEM and to be read out of the memory MEM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> further includes encoding means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which are connected to the data processing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and to which data DA, for example a data word DW, can be applied by the data processing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in order to transmit said data DA to the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The encoding means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> encode the applied data DA and after this encoding they supply encoded data CDA, for example an encoded data word CDW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> further includes a control signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, to which the encoded data CDA or CDW can be applied by the encoding means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The control signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can generate a control signal CSL, which is available on an output of the control signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> further includes a load modulation stage <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which is arranged in parallel with the transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and which includes a resistor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a switch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which is arranged in series with the resistor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and which is formed by a transistor. The switch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be controlled with the aid of the control signal CSL supplied by the control signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thus enabling the switch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to be switched between its non-conductive state-shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and its conductive state, which results in a different load of the transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and thus in a load modulation of an unmodulated carrier signal generated by the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and applied to the station transmission coil <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of this station. In this way, a data transmission from the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is possible by load modulation of an unmodulated carrier signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> further includes a direct voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which serves to generate and to supply a d.c. supply voltage V for the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and for the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The d.c. supply voltage V can be applied to all circuit elements of the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which require this d.c. supply voltage, but this is not illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for in order achieve that the clarity of this Figure is not affected unduly. The direct voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a rectifier stage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The direct voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further includes a voltage limiting circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which consists of a control signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and of a parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed by means of a FET and of series controller stage <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Instead of the FET it is possible to use transistors of other types. The rectifier stage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is arranged in parallel with the transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The rectifier stage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> derives from the electrical energy produced in the transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is caused by the modulated or unmodulated carrier signal transmitted inductively from the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a direct voltage, which is applied both to the control signal generating stage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and to the series controller stage <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The control signal generating stage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> generates a control signal CSB, which is applied to the control electrode of the FET forming the parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in order to control the latter. The parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed by the FET constitutes an input circuit having an input resistance. The input resistance of the input circuit, i.e. of the parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, can be changed with the aid of the control signal CSB, as a result of which the input resistance can be reduced by reducing the input resistance of the input stage, i.e. by reducing the resistance in the main current path of the FET, thereby enabling the energy supplied to the rectifier stage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to be reduced. Thus, a voltage limitation can be achieved by means of the control signal generating stage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the parallel stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, when this is necessary. In addition, the direct voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes the series controller stage <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which provides finer control than attainable with the parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The provision of such a parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and such a series controller stage <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is known per se since some time from existing data carriers an existing integrated circuits. A buffer capacitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is connected to the output <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The generated d.c. supply voltage V is available across the buffer capacitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> include detection means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for detecting the temperature prevailing in the environment of the detection means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, the detection means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are arrange in the proximity of the direct voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and, particularly, in the proximity of the parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> because in this area temperature rise in the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and in the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is largest as a result of the strong limiting action of the parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the consequent dissipation of the applied energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The detection means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> include a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and sensor signal processing means arranged after the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can be realized simply with the aid of a diode on which a constant current is impressed and whose diode voltage is temperature dependent in accordance with a known characteristic. Thus, the diode voltage represents the output signal of the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which is applied to the sensor signal processing means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Instead of by means of a diode, the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can be realized with the aid of a bipolar transistor whose temperature dependent base-emitter voltage forms the output signal of the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, or with the aid of a CMOS transistor whose gate voltage forms the output signal of the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a representation signal RS is generated with the aid of the sensor signal processing means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in dependence on the output signal of the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which representation signal is representative of the temperature prevailing in the environment of the detection means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and of the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The representation signal RS is applied to the control signal generating stage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the voltage limiting circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via a connection <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. When the temperature rises, which is detected with the aid of the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, such a representation signal RS is generated and applied to the control signal generating stage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that the control signal generating stage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> produces a larger or stronger control signal CSB, as a result of which the FET forming the parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is driven into its low-resistance region and the limiting action of the parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is thus increased. This, in its turn, results in energy supplied to the rectifier stage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> being limited, which counteracts the temperature rise in the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Since the parallel resistance is reduced because the FET is driven into its low-resistance region, the input voltage for the rectifier stage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> becomes too small required for a satisfactory and correct power supply, but this is compensated for in that the part of the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> after the series controller stage <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which should be energized with the supply voltage V, are subsequently energized via the buffer capacitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which buffer capacitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> ensures that an adequate supply voltage V is sustained, which is required inter alia for the control of the FET forming the parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In order to obtain a comparatively long time in which an adequate power supply with the aid of a buffer capacitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is guaranteed for a given capacitance of the buffer capacitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, it is advantageous to turn off parts of the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which are not needed in this operating situation, so as to avoid unnecessary loading of the buffer capacitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, or to connect the buffer capacitor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> only to certain parts of the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which also leads to a reduction of the power drain from the buffer capacitor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A variant of the embodiment of the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> described hereinbefore, which variant is shown in dash-dot lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, includes initiation means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which, in addition to the control signal generating stage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, include two further parts, namely an analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, arranged after the sensor signal processing means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the detection means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and data word processing means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, realized with the aid of the data processing device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this variant the representation signal RS can be applied to the analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> effects an analog-to-digital conversion and supplies a data word DW which corresponds to the representation signal RS and which is applied to the data word processing means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The data processing means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> process the applied data word DW and supply a signal to the control signal generating stage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> via a connection <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which signal is processed in the control signal generating stage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and thus influence or change the control signal CSB supplied by the control signal generating stage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the resistance of the FET forming the parallel controller stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is reduced when a temperature increase is detected by means of the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows only a part of a data carrier I whose integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> includes, in addition to the capacitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided as a main component of the transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a first additional capacitor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a second additional capacitor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as well as a third capacitor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>.

The three switches <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are realized with the aid of transistors. In the present case, the three switches <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> can be controlled with the aid of the data word processing means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and can thus be switched between their non-conductive states, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and their conductive states, not shown, as a result of which one or more of the additional capacitors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be arranged selectively in parallel with the capacitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By selectively switching at least one additional capacitor into circuit the resonant frequency of the transmission resonant circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be changed in a simple manner.

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes encoding means <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, to which data DA supplied by the station data processing device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be applied and which decode said data DA and supply accordingly encoded data CDA.

The amplitude modulation means <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> can effect an amplitude modulation of the carrier signal CS in dependence on the encoded data CDA, as a result of which the amplitude modulation means <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> supply an amplitude-modulated carrier signal AMCS. The amplitude-modulated carrier signal AMCS can be given a desired level with the aid of amplifier means <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The amplifier means <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are followed by controllable resistance means <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, with the aid of which a variable resistance, namely a variable output resistance of the amplifier means <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is attainable.

As a result of the demodulation with the aid of the demodulation means <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> the demodulation means <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> supply encoded data CDA, which are formed by, for example, an encoded data word CDW.

The data DA, i.e. the data word DW, can be applied to the station processing means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, which process the data DA, i.e. the data word DW. When the station processing means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> process a data word DW, which has been transmitted from the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a transmission signal which corresponds to the representation signal RS, the station processing means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> generate a first control signal CS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is applied to control signal processing means <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a connection <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The control signal processing means <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are adapted to process the first control signal CS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and to generate a second control signal CS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in dependence on the first control signal CS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The control signal processing means <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> supply the generated second control signal CS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to a control input <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the controllable resistance means <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> via a connection <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, as a result of which the resistance values that can be realized with the aid of the controllable resistance means <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> can be changed by means of the second control signal CS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The transmission of the data word DW corresponding to the representation signal RS from the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is suitably effected automatically at given time intervals. However, it is alternatively possible that the temperature prevailing in the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is communicated to the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in dependence on whether given temperature values are reached, in which case for example a so-called heat information bit in a data word DW is set to a given value when a temperature threshold value is exceeded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> When in the embodiment of the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and of the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> the detection means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> detect an increase in temperature, this results in a corresponding representation signal RS, which in its turn leads to a corresponding transmission signal, i.e. a corresponding data word DW. This data word DW is transmitted to the communication station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the aid of the initiation means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and is recovered with the aid of the demodulation means <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the decoding means <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and is eventually processed with the aid of the station processing means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, yielding a first control signal CS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponding to the data word DW and a second control signal CS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponding to the first control signal CS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and, consequently, also to the data word DW. With the aid of the second control signal CS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponding to the data word DW the controllable resistance means <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are influenced, as a result of which it is achieved that the energy content of the communication signal AMCS transmitted from the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be changed. As a matter of fact, the output resistance for the amplifier means <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is adjusted with the aid of the controllable resistance means <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in such a manner that in response to the increasing temperature in the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the energy content of a communication signal AMCS transmitted from the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reduced, as a result of which the temperature rise in the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is counteracted rapidly and effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the embodiment of the data carrier I and of the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4 a</cross-reference> change of the temperature prevailing in the data carrier I and in the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is initiated in this data reduction circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in this integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, while the means and measures for changing the temperature prevailing in the data carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in the integrated circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are provided inside the communication station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
