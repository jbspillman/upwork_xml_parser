<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a plastic container with a thin mouth body that is improved in strength, appearance and functionality by making the mouth and a specified portion of the body thicker than the body proper, and a method for manufacturing the plastic container. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Demand for plastic containers such as bottles is expected to increase in the future. At the same time, many efforts are being made to reduce the thickness of bottles so as to lower their cost and reduce volume at the time of waste disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Generally, plastic bottles are classified into two kinds by manufacturing method: direct blown bottles and draw blown bottles. In the direct blow method, plastic bottles are manufactured by blow molding a hot parison in a die immediately after heating, melting and then extruding the parison through the die head of an extruder (melting blow molding). In the draw blow method, plastic bottles are manufactured by cooling a parison extruded from an extruder or injected from an injector, thereafter heating the cooled parison again to a temperature for drawing and then blow molding it in a die (stretch blow molding). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, the method where a hot parison is blow molded just after extrusion from an extruder has been generally used in view of thermal economy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce the thickness of direct blow bottles, it is, taking blow ratio into account, necessary to extrude a parison as thin as possible from a die head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In melt blow molding, the space between the core and the shell in a die head (die) is changed to adjust the thickness of the parison locally. Japanese Patent Laid-open No. S62(1987)-202713 teaches a method for making the adjustment by moving the core upward or downward, whereas Japanese Patent Laid-open No. H5(1993)-104525 teaches a method for making the adjustment by changing the position of the shell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In such a conventional technique of changing the space between the core and shell for adjusting the thickness of the parison, it is easy to gradually change the thickness in small degrees but it is difficult to abruptly change in the thickness by a large degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This is because a large taper angle of the core is required for abruptly changing the thickness of the parison in the die head. However, if the taper angle is large, the pressure for extruding the resin and the discharge amount of the resin cannot be sufficiently controlled. As a result, the thickness of the parison cannot be precisely adjusted. These methods are therefore not practical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The conventional techniques are not capable of reducing the thickness of the body and shoulder while maintaining a specified thickness of the mouth. If the body and shoulder are made thinner, the mouth is disadvantageously made thinner at the same time. Such a thin mouth may deform at the time of capping, leading to insufficient sealing that may cause problems such as liquid leakage. Further, reamer finishing of the diameter and surface of the mouth become difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> By the conventional techniques, it was difficult to make only a part of the body thick, while maintaining a thin bottle thickness overall. Thus, there has been a limit to the degree that the thickness of a bottle can be reduced and still obtain the desired strength. There has also been a limit to the degree that a bottle can be imparted with decorative property and the degree that its direction of collapse during disposal can be controlled (the amount of functionality that can be imparted). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This invention was accomplished in light of the foregoing circumstances. One object of the invention is therefore to provide a plastic container, such as a bottle, of reduced thickness and enhanced strength, decorative appearance and functionality obtained by making the mouth and/or specified parts of the body thicker; and a method for manufacturing the plastic container. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a plastic container manufactured by melting blow molding a heated and molten parison extruded from an extruder, wherein a mouth of the container has a thickness of 1.0 to 5.0 mm, a body of the container has a thickness of 0.1 to 1.5 mm, and the thickness ratio of the mouth to the body is in the range of 3 to 50. The thickness of the plastic container preferably becomes abruptly thinner from the mouth to the shoulder of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the so-configured plastic container, even if the thickness of the body is made as thin as possible, the thickness of the mouth can be thick enough not to be deformed. Thus, the container of the present invention can solve the problems of imperfect capping and difficult reaming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a plastic container manufactured by melting blow molding a heated and molten parison extruded from an extruder, a specified part of the body of the container having increased thickness. In this container, only the specified part of the body of the container is thick and the body is thin overall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The container wherein only a specified part of the body is thick can be embodied in various ways. For example, one or a plurality of thick parts can be continuously or discontinuously formed over part or all of the periphery of the body of the container. One or a plurality of thick parts can be continuously or discontinuously formed over part or all of the height of the body of the container. One or a plurality of thick parts can be continuously or discontinuously formed helically over part or all of the body of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, the thickness ratio of the thick parts to the body proper is preferably in the range of 1.5 to 10.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As stated above, by forming one or a plurality of thick parts continuously or discontinuously over part or all of the body in any direction, the strength of the body can be enhanced, the body can be imparted with decorative property, and/or the functionality of the container can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> This invention also directed to a method for manufacturing the plastic containers. Specifically, this invention provides a method for manufacturing a plastic container by melting blow molding a heated and molten parison extruded from an extruder, wherein resin is added to a part of the parison corresponding to the mouth and/or a specified part of the body of the container in a prescribed amount such that the mouth and/or the specified part of the body becomes thicker than the body proper when the container is molded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The prescribed amount of the resin is preferably added when the parison is extruded and molded by supplying the resin from a discharge outlet provided in the die head of the extruder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> By the method, a prescribed amount of resin is added to a specified part of a parison (corresponding to the mouth and/or a thick part of the body) at the time when the parison is molded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the method of the present invention, by forming one or a plurality of thick parts continuously or discontinuously in the mouth, and in any direction over part or all of the body, a plastic container can be easily and precisely manufactured to have higher strength in the mouth and body, a decorative appearance, and/or improved functionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;body&rdquo; is sometimes used herein with regard to an invention container having a neck and a shoulder to include the neck and the shoulder. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the plastic container and the method for manufacturing the plastic container according to the present invention will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;First Embodiment of Plastic Container&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> First, a first embodiment will be explained in which the present invention is applied to the mouth of a bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view of an essential part of the plastic container according to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is manufactured by extruding a heated and molten parison through the die head of an extruder and blow molding it. For ordinary bottles having a volume of 300 ml to 2000 ml, the thickness W<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 0.3 to 1.3 mm and the thickness W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the mouth <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is 1.0 to 5.0 mm. The ratio of the thickness W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the mouth <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the thickness W<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is in the range of 3.3 to 17. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> If the volume of the bottle is smaller than the above value, the thickness ratio of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the mouth <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes smaller. If the volume of the bottle is larger than the above value, the thickness ratio of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the mouth <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes larger. In this case, the thickness W<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be 0.1 to 1.5 mm and the ratio of the thickness W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the mouth <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the thickness W<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be in the range of 3 to 50. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the shoulder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> between the mouth <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> becomes abruptly thinner from the connection <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> between the mouth <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the shoulder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The shoulder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be shaped so that its thickness becomes continuously thinner without any step as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or becomes abruptly thinner with a step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, while the resin added at the mouth <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is preferably the same as that of the bottle body proper, use of a different resin is acceptable. The resin(s) used are decided based on the material properties, use, size and the like of the bottle. The addition amount of the resin is also controlled based on the material properties, use, size and the like of the bottle. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic view showing a molding device used in the method of manufacturing bottles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The device for molding a parison has a main extruder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, storage units <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a switching unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The main extruder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> heats and melts a thermoplastic resin and continuously supplies it to the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the space between a shell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be adjusted in accordance with instructions output by a controller (not shown) based on a parison control program. The die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extrudes the molten resin extruded from the extruder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while controlling the thickness of the parts of the parison corresponding to the respective parts of the bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The parison extruded from the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is immediately supplied to an ordinary blow molding device (not shown) to be molded into a bottle in an ordinary manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has storage units <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for temporarily storing molten resin and a switching unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for switching between storage and supply of the resin to intermittently extrude the molten resin. A prescribed amount of the molten resin extruded from the sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is intermittently supplied via the storage units <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the switching unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a path <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> communicating the storage units <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The storage units <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are provided with two accumulators <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and the switching unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is provided with a switching valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The switching valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> alternately makes and breaks connection between the two accumulators <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Further the valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> alternately makes and breaks connection between the two accumulators <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the communicating path <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The switching valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and two accumulators <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> also operate according to instructions output by the controller (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) based on the parison control program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Specifically the accumulator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is charged with a prescribed amount of resin extruded from the sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the switching valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The program designates that a specified portion of the parison (corresponding to the mouth of the bottle) is to be made thicker. Once the specified portion has moved to the outlet of the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the switching valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is switched according to instructions from the controller, and the accumulator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> operates to supply the charged molten resin to the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the communicating path <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, thereby adding the resin to the specified portion of the parison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> At this time, the switching valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> connects the accumulator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the communicating path <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and simultaneously connects the accumulator <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to the sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to charge the accumulator <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> with resin extruded from the sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the two accumulators <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are alternately charged with molten resin from the sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and alternately supply a prescribed amount of the molten resin to the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The switching valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is operated by a cylinder (not shown). The accumulators <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are operated by cylinders <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not limited to an extruder which continuously extrudes resin at a constant rate. It may instead be an extruder with a reciprocating screw which intermittently extrudes resin at a constant rate. When such an extruder is used, the reciprocating motion of the screw of the sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is controlled in synchronism with the movement of the switching valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the accumulators <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As explained above, a prescribed amount of molten resin supplied from the sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is added to the specified portion of the parison (corresponding to the mouth of the bottle). The parison is immediately held by a pair of dies (not shown) and pressurized air is then blown for melting blow molding to produce a bottle. Even if the parison is subjected to melting blow molding so as to make the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and shoulder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> thin, the mouth <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be molded to have the required thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The resin forming the parison is preferably the same as the resin added to a mouth, but can be different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Although a monolayer die head is used in this embodiment, a die head for forming multiple layers may be similarly used. In this case, a bottle with a thick body as well as a thick mouth is obtained. A plastic container with a thick body and a manufacturing method thereof will be explained in the second embodiment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the case where bottles were manufactured by the method according to the embodiment of the present invention, even if the body was made considerably thin, the thickness of the mouth could be maintained at the required thickness. On the contrary, in the case where bottles were manufactured by the conventional method, if the body was made considerably thin, the thickness of the mouth was inevitably thin. Satisfactory capping and reaming could not be performed, resulting in defective products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the present invention, the body can be reduced to the minimum practical thickness while maintaining a large mouth thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Second Embodiment of Plastic Container&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> show bottles according a second embodiment obtained by applying the present inventionto the bottle body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, three ring-like thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are circumferentially formed in the upper part of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be formed with discontinuous thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> When ring-like thick parts are circumferentially formed in the body of a bottle as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, even if the thickness of the bottle is thin, the strength is enhanced in the diameter direction so that the graspability of the bottle is improved. Further, if pressure is applied to the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the axial direction at the time of disposal, the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will collapse in the axial direction like bellows. That is to say, the functionality of the bottle can be improved; for example, the volume of the bottle can be decreased and the bottle can be made easy to dispose of. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be distributed over the entire axial length of the body or at any given region thereof. The number and width of the parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be properly determined based on the purpose of the bottle. The parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be formed to protrude integrally outward from the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> by matching the shape of the die for molding the bottle to the position and width of the parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> plurality of stripe-like thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed along substantially the entire axial length of the body. When the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is given the shape of a square column, the thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>can be arranged on all or any side surface of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is given a cylindrical shape, the thick parts can be arranged on the peripheral surface at regular or irregular intervals. Further, the thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>can be arranged discontinuously. In the case of discontinuous thick parts, their sizes can be varied, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> By forming thick parts along the axial direction of a bottle body, the strength of the bottle is enhanced along the axial direction. This enables them to be stacked after filling. Further, if pressure is applied to the bottle from its sides at the time of disposal, the bottle will collapse in the diameter direction to assume a plate-like shape, so that the volume can be easily decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the case where thick part(s) are arranged along the axial direction, the part(s) can be distributed over all or any part in the axial direction. The number and width of the parts can be properly determined according to the purpose of the bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> patch-like thick part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is formed at one or more parts of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If such a patch-like thick part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is formed at a handle part of the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the thin handle part can be reinforced to make the bottle easier to hold and the strength can be enhanced against shock such as at dropping. If the patch-like thick part is formed at a part corresponding to an in-mold-label, it functions as a reinforcement for preventing breakage at the label edge. If it is formed at a part to be printed, the functionality of the bottle, such as the rigidity at the time of printing and inkability, is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Like the above-mentioned thick parts, the patch-like thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>can be formed in any size. If a colored resin, glossy resin, mat resin or pearlized resin is used, a bottle with a distinctive appearance can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>of different width are alternately formed in the periphery like rings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Since resin is added in sets of two or more rings, resins with various kinds or colors can be added to obtain a bottle having improved appearance in addition to advantages like those of the bottle of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> thick part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>is helically formed in the body periphery. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shaped like a square column and a thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>are formed obliquely on any or all side surfaces of the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A bottle formed helically or obliquely with the thick part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>has the sane advantages as those of a bottle reinforced in both the axial and circumferential directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the case where one or more thick parts are formed helically or obliquely, the parts can be distributed over all or any part of the peripheral surface of the body, as in the above-mentioned bottles. The number and width of the parts can be properly determined depending on the purpose of the bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In the bottles shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the above-mentioned other modified bottles, the thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>are formed in the various shapes and therefore also function to decorate the bottles. If a colored resin, glossy resin, mat resin or pearlized resin is used as the resin constituting the thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, the decorating function is enhanced and the appearance of the bottles is effectively improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>, a thick part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>is circumferentially formed in the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and concave parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>(only one shown) for finger insertion are formed in the part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>at diametrically opposed portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Even if the overall thickness of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is thin, the provision of the parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>give the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> excellent graspability so that the user can firmly hold the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In addition, the user can securely hold the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by inserting fingers into the concave parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The bottles of the above examples are manufactured by extruding a heated and molten parison through the die head of an extruder and blow molding it. For 300 ml to 2000 ml bottles currently in general use, the thickness W<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of a body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 0.3 to 1.3 mm and the thickness W<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>is 0.5 to 2.0 mm. The ratio of the thickness W<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>to the thickness W<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is in the range of 1.5 to 5.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> If the volume of the bottle is smaller than the above value, the thickness ratio of the body to the thick parts becomes smaller. If the volume of a bottle is larger than the above value, the thickness ratio of a body to the thick parts becomes larger. In this case, the thickness W<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be 0.1 to 1.5 mm and the ratio of the thickness W<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>to the thickness W<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be in the range of 5.0 to 10.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A preferred ratio of the thickness W<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>to the thickness W<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is in the range of 1.5 to 10.0. if the ratio of the thickness W<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>to the thickness W<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is smaller than 1.5, the thickness of the thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> becomes insufficient so that the advantages of the invention cannot be satisfactorily obtained, while if the ratio is greater than 10, the thick parts become unnecessarily thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the bottles of this embodiment, the resin added to the thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>can be the same as or different from that of the body proper of the bottle. The resin(s) used are decided based on the material properties, use, size and the like of the bottle.

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, a method of manufacturing bottles according to a second embodiment will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic view showing a molding device used in the method of manufacturing bottles. The device for molding a parison shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> has a main extruder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, storage units <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a switching unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The structure of parts other than the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is similar to that of the molding device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Thus, most of the method of manufacturing bottles according to the second embodiment is the same as the method of manufacturing bottles according to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is provided under a shell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with a discharge outlet <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for adding molten resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> A die with concave parts corresponding to the thick parts of the bottle can be used as the die in the blow molding device (not shown). If a die without any concave or convex parts on the surface thereof is used, thick parts are formed inward of the inner surface of a bottle. However, if concave parts are formed on the surface of the die in correspondence to the thick parts, the thick parts are protruded outward from the body and the thickness thereof is defined by the depth of the concave parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> For a die used to mold bottles with concave parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>formed midway between thick part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 15</cross-reference>, convex parts are formed at the parts corresponding to the concave parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>. The depth of the concave parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>can be adjusted by adjusting the height of the convex parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> intermittently supplies molten resin to the outlet <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the storage units <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the switching unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and a path <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> communicating the storage units <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Specifically, a parison control program designates that a specified portion of the parison (corresponding to a thick part of the bottle) is to be made thicker. Once the specified portion has moved to the outlet of the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the switching valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is switched according to instructions from the controller, and the accumulator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> operates to supply charged molten resin to the outlet <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> located at the lower part of the die head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the communicating path <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, thereby adding the resin to the specified portion of the parison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the specified portion of the parison (corresponding to the thick part of the bottle) is added with a prescribed amount of molten resin supplied from the sub-extruder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The parison is immediately held by a pair of dies (not shown), and pressurized air is then blown for melting blow molding to produce a bottle. Even if the parison is subjected to melting blow molding so as to make the body of a bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> thin, the specified part can be molded to be thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Next, die heads <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> used in the method of manufacturing bottles will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The die head used in the method of manufacturing bottles can be either a monolayer die head as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> or a multilayer die head as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In the multilayer die head of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, two discharge outlets <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for adding resin to the parison are provided in the flow direction of the parison. Since different sub-extruders can supply resins to the outlets <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively, two kinds of resins with different material properties, colors or the like can be added to one and the same parison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the same sub-extruder can supply the same resin to the nozzles <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In the monolayer and multilayer die heads, the discharge outlet <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be open along all the periphery of the core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to add resin to the entire periphery of the parison, or can be only partially open to add resin front part of the periphery of the core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (one or more positions). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the die head of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> taken along line I-I in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the periphery of the outlet <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> surrounding the core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is closed except at four slits and resin is discharged only from the four slits <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Such structure where the slits <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are formed for the discharge of resin at part of the periphery surrounding the core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be applied to a multilayer die head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows a rotary die head in which a discharge outlet (slit) for adding resin to the parison can rotate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the die head of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> taken along line II-II in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>.

Alternatively, slits may be formed at a plurality of positions. The slit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can rotate around the core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The relationships between these die heads and the bottle shapes will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> When using a monolayer die head with a discharge outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> opening along the entire periphery of the core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a ring-like continuous thick part can be formed in the periphery of the bottle body. In this case, by adding resin one or more times at regulated intervals during the molding of the parison, one or more thick parts <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be formed in the direction of the height of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a bottle formed with three ring-like continuous thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> When using a monolayer die head with slits <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed at plural positions of the periphery of the core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and adding resin for a short period of time, a ring-like discontinuous thick part can be formed in the periphery of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the bottle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If resin is added three times for short periods of time during the extrusion and molding of the parison, a bottle with three ring-like discontinuous thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> When resin is continuously added for a long period of time during the molding of the parison, a bottle can be obtained that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, has a plurality of stripe-like thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed in the direction of the height of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> When resin is added three times with each succeeding addition being made a little longer that the previous one during the extrusion and molding of the parison, discontinuous thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>varying size are formed in the direction of the height of a body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Further if the width of a slit is increased, a patch-like thick part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>can be formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> When a multilayer die head with a discharge outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> opening along the entire periphery of the core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is used, two, or a multiple of two, different thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, . . . (of various widths, materials, colors or the like) can be formed in the periphery of the bottle body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The bottle shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> can be formed by using a multilayer die head with an upper outlet and a lower outlet of narrower width than that of the upper outlet and adding resin twice during the molding of the parison. As a result, two ring-like continuous thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>with different widths are formed in the periphery of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> When a rotary die head with slits <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed in one or plural positions of the periphery of the core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is used, the bottle shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is obtained. In the case where the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a cylinder, if resin is continuously added from one slit while rotating the die head at a relatively high speed during the molding of the parison, a bottle with a thick part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>helically formed on the cylinder body can be obtained as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. In the case where a body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a square column, if resin is added from four slits while rotating the die head at a low speed during the molding of the parison, a bottle with thick parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>formed on each of the four side surfaces can be obtained as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned relationships between the die heads and the bottle shapes are just examples. Bottles of various shapes can be formed by changing or combining the shape of the discharge outlet of the die head (with or without a slit(s)); the number and width of a slit(s), and space between slits; the number of resin additions and the width and period of each addition during the molding of the parison; the number and width of the discharge outlets in a multilayer die head; the rotary speed of a rotary slit; and the like. Bottles of various shapes other than those shown in the drawings can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In the bottles according to the second embodiment of the present invention, since a specified part is thicker than the body proper, while maintaining the minimum practical thickness of the body, the strength, appearance and functionality of the container can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Resins that can be preferably used as the thermoplastic resin in the first and second embodiments include olefin resins such as high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and polypropylene. These olefin resins can be used in combination with other resins such as ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers, polyamide resins, cyclic olefin resins and polyester resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> For example, the first and second embodiments can be simultaneously applied to one and the same plastic container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The means for adding resin to the parison is not limited to the aforesaid combination of sub-extruder, switching unit and storage unit, and any of various other means, such as an injector, can be used instead. In the case of using an injector, the injection by the injector is controlled based on programmed instructions from a controller, like in the above embodiments. Further, an extruder with a reciprocating screw may be used. In this extruder, resin is stored when the screw is moved rearward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> According to the plastic container and method of manufacturing the container of the present invention described in the foregoing, a specified part of the container can independently be made thicker than the overall container thickness. Thus, in various plastic containers including bottles, isolated portions, such as the mouth, a part of the body desired liable to be bent or to have a decorative appearance, or a part desired to be collapsed in a certain direction, can be made thicker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> According to the method of manufacturing a plastic container of the present invention, the containers described in the foregoing can be easily and reliably manufactured. </paragraph>
