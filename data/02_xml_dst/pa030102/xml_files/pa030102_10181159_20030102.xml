<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> At this time, the authentication server of the cellular phone service company transmits a cipher to the cellular phone by an encryption algorithm or a random number table recorded in the cellular phone and discriminates whether the cellular phone is registered properly or not through a response signal. Thereafter, the approval of authentication is determined finally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the authentication server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> transmits the requested result of the approval of the authentication to the internet electronic commerce server in step S<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Then, the internet electronic commerce server informs the result of the approval of the authentication to the purchaser through internet in step S<highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As above, when calling to the authentication server of the cellular phone service company, the user can connect to the authentication server by using a special phone number for authentication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to the present invention, there is an advantage that when connecting to internet or performing electronic commerce, the authentication is performed by using the cellular phone which is separately constructed against an internet line and therefore, a double security device through the internet electronic commerce server and the authentication server of the cellular phone service company is secured, thereby preventing hacking basically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> There is another advantage that the secret number of the cellular phone which is used for identifying the cellular phone in the cellular phone service company is used to connect to a special site or to authenticate the electronic payment, thereby capable of using a separate encryption method, which is different from that of the plural lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> There is also an advantage that a transmission of information required for the authentication is performed between the cellular phone and the authentication server of the cellular phone service company through communications of a short message service and registration of location, thereby performing the authentication process without a direct calling to the cellular phone service company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the cellular phone service user applies for the registration of the authentication service to the cellular phone service company, thereby securing safety of the electronic payment when connecting to the internet site or performing electronic commerce and also at the position of the manager of the internet site, safety of the authentication process can be provided to the registered users through a single contract of the authentication service with the cellular phone service company without adapting the separate authentication device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> There is also an advantage that since the cellular phone service company can provide a new service it is easy to attract members and commercial profit can be obtained from the contracted internet site and members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described embodiment is not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the meets and bounds of the claims, or equivalences of such meets and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims. </paragraph>
