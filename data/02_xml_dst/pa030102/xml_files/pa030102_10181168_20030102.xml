<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a wet multi-disk clutch in part of a vehicle drive and a lubricant for a housing containing said clutch, comprising an input member and an output member, and a number of first disks connected to the input member and of second disks connected to the output member, which can be pressed together by actuating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Wet multi-disk clutches are used in drive trains of motor vehicles, predominantly in differential locks, in all-wheel drive systems for connecting up the additional drive axle or for changing the torque distribution between the axles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In these applications, the clutch does not function simply as a selector clutch that can be engaged and disengaged but also as a control clutch and also operates for relatively long periods in slip. In this arrangement, vibrations occur, though sometimes only in the course of the clutch&apos;s life, and these are perceived as anything from a low moan to a high-frequency whine. Apart from the fact that this noise is irritating, such vibrations lead to a reduction in service life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The cause of these vibrations is probably a negative gradient in the friction coefficient. This gradient is taken to mean the reduction in the friction coefficient between the first and second disks as the rotational-speed difference increases. Initially, this is the transition from static friction to sliding friction with a relatively low coefficient of sliding friction; as the rotational-speed difference increases further, the friction coefficient can fall further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The aim has therefore been to create a tribosystem in which the gradient of the friction coefficient is positive or at least not negative, at least in a certain range. One known solution to this is to choose pairs of disks in which the disks are composed of steel sheet and the first disks are provided with a sintered coating in certain surface patterns. Another known solution is to use fluids that are particularly suitable for wet clutches, as in automatic transmissions for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, it has been found that even such tribosystems cannot reliably prevent the vibrations described, at least not after a certain time in operation, with the result that the disks soon have to be replaced. However, this is disadvantageous, especially in the case of clutches that are integrated into the vehicle drive because changing the disks is generally particularly labor-intensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When using such clutches in housings in which other drive components are also accommodated, another difficulty is that the drive components require oils with special lubricating properties, e.g. hypoid oils, but these are less suitable for clutches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is therefore the object of the invention to propose a tribosystem for friction clutches that prevents the occurrence of vibrations reliably and for the entire service life, even under the unfavorable conditions described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, this is achieved by virtue of the fact that the first disks are composed of steel and have on their friction faces linings composed of carbon fibers embedded in a carbon matrix, which linings are interrupted by channels leading from the inside outward, and that the second disks are composed of steel and their friction faces are provided with a nickel dispersion layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This tribosystem, which solves the problem set, has been determined in extensive tests. It has furthermore been found that the nickel dispersion layer is particularly effective if it has a crystalline structure and if it furthermore contains 2 to 5 percent by volume of uniformly dispersed titanium nitride.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the fixed housing of the drive unit is denoted by <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A drive housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is driven from a power source that is not shown. A first output shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a second output shaft <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected in terms of drive to both wheels on one axle of a vehicle or to two axles of a vehicle, respectively, although this is not shown. The two output shafts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are driven by the drive housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a differential <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A hydraulic coupling dependent on a differential rotational speed is furthermore provided between the drive housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the first output shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, comprising a friction clutch <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a hydrostatic displacement machine <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is merely indicated. It is bolted to a sump ring <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an end plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In the housing, there is an oil sump <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A seal support ring <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is seated on the inside of the end plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The differential <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises a differential housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which forms part of the drive housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, differential wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with their shaft, a first output bevel wheel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which is firmly connected to the first output shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a second output bevel wheel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which is firmly connected to the second output shaft <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The friction clutch <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is likewise accommodated in the differential housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in the inner coupling teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of which second disks (outer plates) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are arranged in a rotationally fixed but axially displaceable manner. First disks (inner plates) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are seated in a rotationally fixed manner on an inner clutch part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the first output bevel wheel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The friction clutch <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> also comprises a piston <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which, on the one hand, exerts pressure on the plates <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and, on the other hand, forms a pressure chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with a valve plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> fixed in the differential housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The displacement machine <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is accommodated in a pump housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> bolted to the differential housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and essentially comprises an inner rotor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the first output shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and an eccentric outer rotor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which can rotate in the pump housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Formed between the two rotors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is a working space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the shape of which is determined by the construction of the displacement machine. At least one pressure passage leads from the working space <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the pressure space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the friction clutch, it being possible for a plurality of pressure passages with corresponding automatically controlled devices to be provided, depending on the construction of the displacement machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows one of the first disks (inner plates), which is denoted overall by <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. It is a steel disk with a thickness of one millimeter, for example, and is in the form of a circular ring with coupling teeth <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on its inner edge and holes <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> distributed around the circumference. On both sides, it has linings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that are distributed uniformly over the circumference and have radial channels <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The linings are composed of carbon fibers, which can form an interwoven structure and are embedded in a matrix of carbon. They are expediently produced by CVD (chemical vapor deposition). The linings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are bonded to the steel disk and their thickness is approximately half that of the steel disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the second disks (outer plates) are denoted overall by <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. They are steel disks with a nickel dispersion layer over the entire surface, i.e. on both sides. The nickel dispersion layer is preferably applied by electrodeposition. The layer is between 5 and 25 micrometers thick while its hardness is within a range of between 400 and 600 HV (Vickers hardness). To further improve its properties, the nickel dispersion layer can contain equally finely dispersed titanium nitrides. In the exemplary embodiment described, the proportion is between 2 and 5% by volume. Laminar deposition should be avoided when applying the dispersion layer since the best characteristics are obtained with crystalline deposition. To obtain a further improvement, nickel can be partially replaced in the nickel dispersion layer by cobalt up to a ratio of 70% of nickel to 30% of cobalt. The second disks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> have coupling teeth <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> on their outer circumference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With the tribosystem described, the desired positive gradient in the friction coefficient and hence the desired freedom from vibration and noise is achieved, even where operating times are very long. </paragraph>
