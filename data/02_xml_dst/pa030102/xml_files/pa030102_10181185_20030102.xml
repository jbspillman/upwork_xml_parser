<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 1,2-dichloroethane that is very pure with respect to chloral or/and chloral hydrate and carbon dioxide, which process comprises oxychlorination of ethylene, using hydrogen chloride and an oxygen-containing gas such as air or oxygen, and alkali treatment of the dichloroethane, and also to 1,2-dichloroethane prepared in accordance with that process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A known process for the preparation of 1,2-dichloroethane is the oxychlorination of ethylene using hydrogen chloride and oxygen, wherein chloral or/and chloral hydrate are formed as undesirable by-products. Also, the product of the process often comprises relatively large amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide formed as a by-product of the reaction of ethylene with oxygen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The publication DE 1 518 931 describes an oxychlorination process for the preparation of 1,2-dichloroethane, wherein the undesirable chloral is removed by means of a condensing step. However, only 75 to 80% of the chloral can be separated out from the product by means of that process step. The remaining chloral is subsequently converted, by increasing the pH, into substances, for example chloroform, that can be more readily separated out by means of distillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Similarly, German Patent Specification 1 468 480 describes an oxychlorination process wherein the undesirable by-products chloral and/or chloral hydrate are converted into sodium formate and chloroform by means of alkali treatment and can therefore be readily separated out from the product of the process, 1,2-dichloroethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The disadvantage of both processes is that a large quantity of the alkali solution, especially aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution, is consumed in neutralising the carbon dioxide and a corresponding amount of alkali metal carbonate or other salts is formed. Larger amounts of alkali solution therefore have to be used than would be necessary purely for converting the chloral and/or chloral hydrate. In addition, the salt charge formed in considerable measure as a result of the neutralisation has to removed from the production plant and disposed of. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The problem of the present invention accordingly was to provide, for the preparation of 1,2-dichloroethane, an oxychlorination process that avoids the disadvantages of the known processes. The problem of the present invention was especially to reduce, or to avoid altogether, the consumption of alkali solution, and the salt charge, during conversion of the undesirable by-products chloral and chloral hydrate and, at the same time, to prepare 1,2-dichloroethane that has only a low content of the said by-products, if any at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The problem is solved by a process for the preparation of 1,2-dichloroethane, which process comprises oxychlorination of ethylene, using hydrogen chloride and an oxygen-containing gas such as oxygen or air, and alkali treatment of the dichloroethane-containing reaction mixture and which is characterised in that carbon dioxide is especially removed from the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing organic phase before alkali treatment of the 1,2-dichloroethane is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It has been found to be especially advantageous for the carbon dioxide to be removed, to as great an extent as possible, from the reaction mixture before alkali treatment of the 1,2-dichloroethane because the formation of large salt charges can be avoided as a result. That spares the production plant and saves working time and costs, because it is no longer necessary, or only necessary to a reduced extent, to remove a salt charge from the production plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a result of the process according to the invention, it is, in addition, advantageously possible to reduce the amount of alkali solutions to be used. The reduced lye requirement allows the production costs to be reduced. That is also advantageous and desirable from a health point of view as smaller volumes of lye have to be handled by the operating staff. In addition, therefore, less lye needs to be disposed of, which constitutes a considerable advantage both from a cost point of view and from an environmental point of view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, pure or very pure EDC has, per kg of EDC, a 2-chloroethanol content of &lt;100 mg, especially &lt;50 mg, preferably &lt;20 mg, more preferably &lt;10 mg, even more preferably &lt;5 mg, and very preferably &lt;2 mg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, very pure EDC has, per kg of EDC, a chloral content of &lt;20 mg, preferably &lt;10 mg, and very preferably &lt;5 mg. In accordance with the invention, very pure EDC has, per kg of EDC, an iron chloride content of &lt;20 mg, preferably &lt;10 mg, more preferably &lt;5 mg, and very preferably &lt;1 mg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment, the process of the invention preferably comprises the following process steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> 1. oxychlorination of ethylene using hydrogen chloride and oxygen, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> 2. quenching, washing and/or cooling and condensing of the reaction gases, that is to say of the products obtained from oxychlorination, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> 3. optionally, separation from the washing liquid, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> 4. distillation and condensing of 1,2-dichloroethane and, where applicable, water from the quench, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> 5. separation of the aqueous phase from the organic phase from step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, optionally after transfer of the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing condensate into a separating vessel, optionally recycling of the aqueous phase to the quench, and optionally recycling of gases to the oxychlorination reaction, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> 6. removal of carbon dioxide from the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing phase (the reaction mixture), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> 7. alkali treatment of the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing phase, for example using an aqueous lye, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> 8. separation of the aqueous phase from the organic phase, optionally after transfer of the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing phase from step 7 into a separating vessel, optionally recycling of the aqueous phase to the quench, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> 9. obtaining 1,2-dichloroethane, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> 10. optionally further working up or further processing steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The 1,2-dichloroethane obtained in that manner is very pure with respect to chloral/chloral hydrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The process conditions of individual steps, known per se, of the process according to the invention, especially the oxychlorination step and the alkali treatment step, can be carried out preferably in accordance with the process conditions described in the publication DE 1 518 931 and German Patent 1 468 480, the disclosures thereof being incorporated by way of reference in the present description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A catalyst is preferably used for the oxychlorination step, with CuCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or FeCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>catalysts having been found to be especially suitable for the purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Before removal of the carbon dioxide, the reaction mixture is preferably blown into a washing-liquid-containing sump region, in the form of a bubble column, of a washing or quenching zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further embodiment of the process, the reaction mixture coming from the reaction zone, which reaction mixture may under certain circumstances include solids, with catalyst fragments under certain circumstances also being present in addition to the gaseous and/or liquid products of oxychlorination of the ethylene, is passed through a washing zone; the washing zone may comprise, for example, a column and a lower sump region arranged in the form of a bubble column. In the process, the reaction mixture preferably enters the lower portion of the bubble column, where it comes into intimate contact with the washing liquid present therein and, at the same time, is quantitatively freed of catalyst fragments. That process step can also be designated quenching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The consumed washing liquid from the sump region of the washing zone is directed away, for example being neutralised and sent to waste water treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The gaseous portion of the reaction mixture, which has been cooled and washed in the washing zone, is passed, by way of a gas line, into a condensing zone, in which there preferably prevail an elevated pressure and a low temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The EDC-containing reaction mixture is substantially condensed therein, preferably under pressure, and is separated from the volatile by-products. The carbon dioxide is present in dissolved form in the condensate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The carbon dioxide, present especially in the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing organic phase, may be separated out using any suitable procedure or apparatus. Separating the carbon dioxide out from the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing phase is preferably carried out by a method involving at least relieving the phase of pressure, for example in a vessel (desorption vessel). In that process, before the pressure is relieved, the phase has, for example, a pressure in the region of about 4 bar abs., whereas after the pressure is relieved it has, for example, a pressure in the region of about 1.1 bar abs. A vessel of that kind preferably has an outlet for drawing off the carbon dioxide (gaseous) and an outlet for the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing phase (liquid). That liquid phase can then be supplied to the further process steps by way of that outlet. A further process step is alkali treatment of the dichloroethane, which is already very pure with respect to CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, for the purpose of removing chloral and/or chloral hydrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment, the carbon dioxide is separated out from the 1,2-dichloroethane phase in a column, by introduction of an inert gas. Any inert gas that is suitable in this process step may be used as the inert gas. The inert gas is preferably nitrogen. 1,2-Dichloroethane and inert gas are advantageously directed past one another in counterflow, as a result of which the mass transfer can be improved. A process course having concurrent flow is, however, also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In yet another preferred embodiment, before the carbon dioxide is separated out, the 1,2-dichloroethane or the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing phases is/are heated, by the introduction of heat, it being possible to use the customary procedures and apparatus known to the person skilled in the art. Special preference is given to carrying using a heat exchanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned procedures relating to the removal of carbon dioxide may also be combined with one another as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As a result of the separating out of carbon dioxide in accordance with the invention, it is possible to remove, completely or virtually completely, from the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing reaction mixture, especially from the organic phase, the carbon dioxide dissolved therein. After the separating out of carbon dioxide, the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing organic phase preferably has a carbon dioxide content of less than 0.3% (w/w), preferably less than 0.2% (w/w) and especially less than 0.06% (w/w). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The process according to the invention makes possible, by simple technical means and in economical manner, effective removal of the catalyst fragments and/or the carbon dioxide from the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing phase. The process according to the invention is first in resulting, in advantageous manner, in significant carbon dioxide separation, allowing a reduced use of base together with effective breakdown of chloral and/or chloral hydrate and accordingly resulting in a reduced salt charge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In an especially preferred embodiment, the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing product from oxychlorination is quenched before the carbon dioxide is separated out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the context of the invention, quenching, for example in the form of cooling and condensing, means that unreacted starting materials, for example hydrogen chloride, are completely or at least substantially removed by means of suitable liquids, solutions, gases or gas mixtures. Quenching according to the invention has the advantage that, in the oxychlorination step, all, or the major portion, of unreacted starting materials are removed from the phase which is subjected to the further process steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The product from the oxychlorination process preferably contains, after quenching, less than 0.010% (w/w) hydrogen chloride, especially less than 0.005% (w/w) and most preferably less than 0.001% (w/w). As a result, undesirable reactions (corrosion) can advantageously be reduced or even avoided altogether. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Special preference is given to quenching by means of bringing into contact with an aqueous solution (washing solution), most preferably with water or an aqueous alkali solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The alkali treatment of the 1,2-dichloroethane-containing phase to be carried out after separating out the carbon dioxide may be accomplished using any suitable procedure and by means of customary apparatus. This process step is preferably carried out using an aqueous alkali solution. The aqueous alkali solution preferably has a pH of more than 8.5, especially more than 9.5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, further customary separation procedures known to the person skilled in the art, such as distillation, may be carried out in order to separate the chloral and/or chloral hydrate breakdown products and further constituents from the 1,2-dichloroethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The organic and aqueous waste products of the process are removed from the process circuit and are disposed of or recycled as necessary. The aqueous alkali solution obtained from the final process step is preferably recycled, especially together with further aqueous phases to which other process steps give rise. In the context of the invention, recycling is understood to mean that products of the process, intermediates or auxiliaries are returned to and used again in a process step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In an especially preferred embodiment, the aqueous alkali solution, alone or together with the further aqueous phases, is recycled to the quench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As a result of recycling the alkali solution to the quench, the pH of the quench is increased, as a result of which it is advantageously possible to improve the washing out of unreacted hydrogen chloride remaining from oxychlorination. Furthermore, additional neutralisation of the lye can, at least in some cases, be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The product of the process, 1,2-dichloroethane, obtained using the process according to the invention is substantially free of chloral and chloral hydrate. It preferably has a chloral or/and chloral hydrate content of less than 0.02% (w/w), preferably less than 0.005% (w/w) and especially less than 0.002% (w/w). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the invention relates to 1,2-dichloroethane that is very pure with respect to chloral and/or chloral hydrate and obtainable using a process as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> 1,2-Dichloroethane according to the invention may advantageously be used in applications where chloral or chloral hydrate would have an adverse effect. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The process is distinguished by the fact that, in accordance with the invention, without a circulating procedure for the suspension, which may possibly contain solids, and irrespective of production changes and of the pH in the course of the washing and/or dwell zone, after separating out carbon dioxide in the desorption zone, the 1,2-dichloroethane/water mixture obtained from the condensing zone at a temperature of preferably from 25 to 45&deg; as a result of its being relieved of pressure needs only to be subjected to alkali treatment with sodium hydroxide solution at an adjustable pH of preferably &gt;8.5, especially &gt;9.5, more especially in the range from 10.5 to 13, and for a dwell time of, for example, from 0.5 to 3 hours in the separating zone in order to obtain effective reduction of the chloral and 2-chloroethanol contents in the 1,2-dichloroethane and, therefore, to ensure the desired EDC quality for a lasting period. The iron chloride content in the product is below the limit of detection at all times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred embodiment, a certain portion of the separated aqueous phase and/or organic phase can be returned to the line leading into the separating zone in order to achieve additional thorough mixing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The course of the process in this instance is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The oxychlorination is carried out under customary process conditions, which will be known to the person skilled in the art and are therefore not explicitly mentioned here. The process gases from the oxychlorination step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, essentially 1,2-dichloroethane, water and the undesirable by-products carbon dioxide, chloral and/or chloral hydrate and possibly further by-products, are quenched in a following process step (the quenching step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) using an aqueous solution. In the process, traces of hydrogen chloride that have not been reacted during oxychlorination and, possibly, catalyst residues are washed out from the product mixture obtained from oxychlorination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The 1,2-dichloroethane-containing phase, together with water, is then distilled off from the quenching step and condensed.
