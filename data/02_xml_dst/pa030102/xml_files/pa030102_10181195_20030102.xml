<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A conventional nail clipper, for example, as shown in Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. Sho 61-82502 has a supporting shaft which is notched to form a bearing hole, and a connecting pin attached to a lever is inserted to the bearing hole. In this nail clipper, although the lever can be incorporated into the supporting shaft easily by virtue of the bearing hole opening to the periphery of the shaft, this configuration per se involves problems that the connecting pin of the lever easily slips off the bearing hole of the supporting shaft and that the strength of the portion of the supporting shaft around the bearing hole is lowered. In addition, it is troublesome to form a supporting shaft having such a shape of bearing hole as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is an objective of the present invention to provide nail clippers, capable of facilitating incorporation of a lever, ensuring bearing of the lever and enhancing the strength of the supporting section. It is another objective of the present invention to provide a nail clipper whose supporting shaft can be molded easily. </paragraph>

The cutting edges of the blade bodies are adapted to be brought into press contact with each other by pressing the blade bodies with the lever against resilience of the blade bodies. The nail clipper is provided with a boss formed either on the lever or on the supporting shaft so as to allow the supporting shaft to pivotally support the lever, and a groove formed on the rest of the supporting shaft and the lever, with which the boss is engaged. The groove has a mouth portion through which the boss is engaged and disengaged, a guiding portion capable of pivotally supporting the boss, and a connecting portion connecting the mouth portion and the guiding portion to each other. Further, the groove has a pair of side wall surfaces opposing each other in the mouth portion, connecting portion and guiding portion and also a bottom surface connecting the side wall surfaces to each other. </paragraph>

In this nail clipper, either the first supporting section of the lever or the second supporting section of the supporting shaft is a boss, while the other supporting section is a groove, with which the boss is engaged. The groove contains a mouth portion through which the boss is engaged and disengaged, a guiding portion capable of pivotally supporting the boss, and a connecting portion connecting the mouth portion and the guiding portion to each other. The groove has a pair of side wall surfaces opposing each other in the mouth portion, connecting portion and guiding portion and also a bottom surface connecting the side wall surfaces to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The nail clipper according another embodiment contains an upper blade body having an upper cutting edge; a lower blade body having a lower cutting edge opposed to the upper cutting edge; a supporting shaft inserted to the blade bodies near the cutting edges respectively, a lower end portion of the supporting shaft being engaged with the lower blade body, while an upper end portion of the supporting shaft protrudes upward through the upper blade body; a lever having a pair of supporting arms; the upper end portion of the supporting shaft being inserted on the upper blade body to a bearing recess defined between the supporting arms of the lever; a first supporting section provided in the supporting arms; and a second supporting section provided at the upper end portion of the supporting shaft; the first and second supporting sections being linked to each other; wherein the upper cutting edge and the lower cutting edge are brought into press contact with each other by pressing the upper blade body with the lever against resilience of the upper and lower blade bodies. In this nail clipper, either the first supporting section of the lever or the second supporting section of the supporting shaft is a pair of bosses opposing each other, and the other supporting section is a pair of grooves, with which the bosses are engaged respectively. Each groove has a mouth portion through which the boss is engaged and disengaged, a guiding portion capable of pivotally supporting the boss, and a connecting portion connecting the mouth portion and the guiding portion to each other. Each groove has a pair of side wall surfaces opposing each other in the mouth portion, connecting portion and guiding portion and also a bottom surface connecting the side wall surfaces to each other. </paragraph>

This supporting shaft <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> contains a large-diameter head <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> formed at the lower end thereof and a small-diameter shank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> extended from the head <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> upward through a step <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is locked by the rim of the bearing hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the lower side of the lower blade body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. An upper end portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the shank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> protrudes through the bearing hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the upper side of the upper blade body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The upper end portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the supporting shaft <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is inserted to this bearing recess <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Each supporting arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the upper end portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the supporting shaft <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are linked to each other in a supporting section S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Materials of Supporting Shaft <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and Lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Both the supporting shaft <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are integrally molded respectively with a synthetic resin material. The synthetic resin material is based on polyamide, polypropylene or aromatic nylon and can contain a predetermined filler. As the filler, a glass fiber, a mineral fiber or a carbon fiber can be used singly, or a combination of at least two of the glass fiber, mineral fiber and carbon fiber may be used. Provided that the content (wt %) of such fillers is &agr;, the value &agr; is defined in this embodiment as 15%&lE;&agr;&lE;65%. However, it is preferably 40%&lE;&agr;&lE;60%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The following characteristics can be obtained by utilizing such synthetic resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> (1) Synthetic resins have high strength and high rigidity after wetting or at high temperatures, high impact strength and high elongation at break as rigid materials and excellent fatigue strength, so that the shaft <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the lever <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> come to have high strength and rigidity. </paragraph>
