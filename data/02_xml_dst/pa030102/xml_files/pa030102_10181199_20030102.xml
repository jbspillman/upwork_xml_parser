<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a DC-DC converter, and more particularly to the DC-DC converter capable of reducing input current ripples for improving circuit efficiency. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,910,712 discloses a DC-DC converter of the type known as a fly-back converter which includes a transformer with a primary winding connected in series with a switching element across an input DC power source and a secondary winding connected across a smoothing output capacitor that is responsible for supplying an output DC voltage to a load. In operation, the switching element is controlled to turn on and off for repetitively interrupting the input DC voltage supplied to the primary winding so as to accumulate the energy in the primary winding when the switching element is on and release the corresponding energy from the secondary winding to charge the smoothing output capacitor when the switching element is off, thereby providing a smoothed DC output voltage to the load. Thus, it is possible to set the output DC voltage at a desired level even lower than the input DC voltage by selecting a duty cycle of the switching element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This circuit, however, permits no input current being supplied from the input DC power source while the switching element is off, thereby suffering from increased input current ripples. The increased ripples results in lowering the circuit efficiency as well as corresponding increased input current peak which necessitates a large capacity for the transformer with attendant increase in the bulk of the transformer. Also, since the transformer in this circuit is alone responsible for conveying the energy from the input DC power source to the load, the transformer has to include a relatively large core in order to prevent magnetic flux saturation and is therefore made into a large bulk. Thus, it is difficult to use the transformer of compact design and to assemble the whole circuit into a compact sufficient to be installed within a limited space. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In view of the above insufficiency, the present invention has been accomplished to provide an improved DC-DC converter with reduced input current ripples which is capable of utilizing a compact transformer for reducing the physical dimensions of the converter, as well as to provide a ballast for a discharge lamp making the use of the compact DC-DC converter. The DC-DC converter in accordance with the present invention has a converter input which is adapted to receive an input DC voltage, and a converter output which is adapted to be connected to a load for proving an output DC voltage to the load. The converter includes a transformer having a primary winding and a secondary winding. The primary winding is connected in series with a switching element across the converter input. The switching element is driven to turn on and off in order to repetitively interrupt the DC input voltage and induce an energy at the secondary winding in response to the switching element being turned off. A capacitor is connected in circuit to be charged by the energy released from the secondary winding so as to accumulate the output DC voltage, and is connected across the converter output to provide the resulting output DC voltage to the load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The characterizing feature of the present invention resides in that the capacitor is connected in series with a rectifier and the secondary winding so as to be charged by the energy released from the secondary winding through the converter input. With this arrangement, the circuit sees an input current which continues flowing through the converter input even while the switching element is turned off. Thus, no interruption in the input DC current is assured to thereby reduce the input current ripples and therefore the input current peak which enables the use of small-sized transformer for overall compact arrangement of the converter, yet improving the circuit efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A controller is included in the converter to determine a switching frequency of the switching element that is sufficiently higher than a resonance frequency given to a resonant system given by the capacitor and the secondary winding in order to restrain undesirable resonance for reliable converter operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the capacitor is connected in series with the primary winding across the DC power source so as to form a closed loop of the capacitor, the secondary winding, the rectifier, the converter input and the primary winding for flowing the input current therethrough while the switching element is off. For this purpose, the secondary winding has a polarity chosen in relation to the winding sense of the primary winding such that the input DC voltage is superimposed in phase upon the voltages induced at the first and second windings, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, the capacitor is connected in series with the secondary winding and the rectifier across the DC power source in parallel with a series combination of the primary winding and the switching element. Thus, there is established a closed loop of the capacitor, the secondary winding, the rectifier and the converter input for flowing the input current therethrough while the switching element is off. To this end, the secondary winding has a polarity chosen in relation to the winding sense of the primary winding such that the input DC voltage is superimposed in phase upon the voltage induced at the secondary winding. Alternatively, the secondary winding may have a polarity chosen in relation to the winding sense of the primary winding such that the input DC voltage is superimposed in reverse phase upon the voltage induced at the secondary winding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a low-pass filter is connected across the converter output in order to remove output ripples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The DC-DC converter can be best applied to a ballast for a discharge lamp in which an inverter is connected to convert the output DC voltage from the converter into an AC voltage for operating the discharge lamp.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding or identical elements throughout the various drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a DC-DC converter in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. A converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is adapted to be connected to a DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be supplied with an input DC voltage therefrom and provides a regulated output DC voltage to energize a load <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Although the illustrated embodiment shows the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which includes a battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an input filter composed of an inductor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the converter can be applied to various DC power sources of different configurations. The converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a transformer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is connected in series with a switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (e.g. transistor) across input terminals <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and a secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which gives antipolarity to the primary winding and is connected in series with a rectifier, i.e., diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in a forward bias relation across output terminals <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected in series with the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> across the input terminals <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with the capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connected between the windings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Connected between the output terminals <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the load <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is a low-pass filter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> composed of an inductor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a capacitor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is driven by a controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to turn on and off at a high frequency of, for example, 20 kHz or more, and at a variable duty cycle based upon a detected voltage across the load <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a detected load current I<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>in order to provide a constant output DC voltage to the load <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In operation, when the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is on, an input current I<highlight><subscript>in1 </subscript></highlight>is drawn from the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to flow through the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the transformer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as indicated by an arrowed solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, so as to store the energy thereat. Upon subsequent turn off of the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the transformer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> releases its energy to flow an input current I<highlight><subscript>in2 </subscript></highlight>through a closed loop of the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, as indicated by an arrowed solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, so as to charge the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The current I<highlight><subscript>in2 </subscript></highlight>includes a current drawn from the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to give no interruption in the input current from the DC power source while the switching element is off, thereby reducing the input current ripples and therefore the current peak. When the switching element is subsequently on, the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> discharges to flow an output current I<highlight><subscript>out1 </subscript></highlight>through the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as indicated by an arrowed broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, for energizing the load. In this sense, the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be defined as an output capacitor which provides the output DC voltage to the load when the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is on. When the switching element is off, the load is continuously supplied with an output current I<highlight><subscript>out2 </subscript></highlight>which is released from the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to flow through the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as indicated by an arrowed broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. As indicated by dots in the figures, the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a winding sense in relation to the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> such that the input DC voltage from the DC voltage source is superimposed in phase upon the voltages of the primary and secondary windings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> when the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows various currents flowing through the circuit of the converter which demonstrates the above circuit operations. In this figure, an input current, which is a combination of currents I<highlight><subscript>in1 </subscript></highlight>and I<highlight><subscript>in2</subscript></highlight>, is expressed by a current I<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>flowing through the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, while the output current I<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>is a combination of the currents I<highlight><subscript>out1 </subscript></highlight>and I<highlight><subscript>out2 </subscript></highlight>flowing through the inductor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Current I<highlight><subscript>32 </subscript></highlight>denotes a current flowing through the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As explained in the above, the input current is continuously fed from the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> irrespectively of the on/off condition of the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the converter can successfully reduce the input current ripples and therefore the input current peak. This reduces a power requirement to the transformer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and therefore makes it possible to use the transformer of a compact size. In addition, since the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is connected in series with the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and is cooperative therewith to charge the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> when the switching element is off, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the number of turns of the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is additive to that of the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the function of charging the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This means that the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be made to have reduced number of turns by the corresponding number of turns of the primary winding. With this result, the transformer can be further made compact as compared to a case in which the secondary winding is alone for charging the capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In addition, the reduced current ripple makes it possible to use the capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of less capacitance while retaining the intended function, thereby assisting to make the whole assembly compact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a ballast for a discharge lamp as one typical application of the DC-DC converter with the load being configured to include an inverter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> providing a low frequency AC voltage of 1 kHz or less for operating the lamp <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and a starter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> providing a high starting voltage of 20 kV or more to the lamp. The inverter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has four switching transistors <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> arranged in the form of a full-bridge connection. The transistors are driven by a driver <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> such that a diagonally opposed pair of transistors <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are simultaneously turned on and off in an alternate relation to the other pair of transistors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, thus converting the output DC voltage from the converter into the AC voltage being applied to the lamp <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The driver <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is connected to receive a low frequency control signal of 1 kHz or less from the controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; to make the low frequency inverter output. The starter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a transformer with a primary winding <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and a secondary winding <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which is connected in series with the lamp <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a path of feeding the inverter output. Connected across the primary winding <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is a series combination of a capacitor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and a switch <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> which is responsible for discharging the capacitor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> so to induce the high starting voltage at the secondary winding <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for applying it to start the lamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The capacitor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is charged by a booster <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which makes the use of a voltage appearing in the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to provide a boosted DC voltage sufficient for rapidly charging the capacitor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The booster <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is configured as a Cockcroft rectifier composed of diodes <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, capacitors <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and a resistor <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. The booster <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> has its input connected across the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and generates the boosted DC voltage from the voltage across the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows another ballast which is identical to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> except that the converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is somewhat modified such that the booster <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> derives a voltage appearing across a series combination of the capacitor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In this connection, the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected in series between the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, while the converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> retains the same operations as discussed in the above. Like parts are designated by like numerals for an easy reference purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a DC-DC converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention which is similar to the first embodiment except that the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>A is connected in series with the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A and the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A across the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in parallel relation to a series combination of the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A. Like parts are designated by like reference numerals with a suffix letter of &ldquo;A&rdquo;. As will be explained below, the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A has the same polarity as the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A such that the input DC voltage is superimposed in phase upon the voltage of the secondary windings <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A when the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A is off. </paragraph>

When the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A is on, DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supplies an input current I<highlight><subscript>in1 </subscript></highlight>flowing through the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A, as indicated by an arrowed solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, to store the energy at the transformer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A. Upon subsequent turn oft of the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A, the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A releases its energy to flow an output current I<highlight><subscript>out2 </subscript></highlight>through the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A to the load, as indicated by an arrowed broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, while allowing an input current I<highlight><subscript>in2 </subscript></highlight>to continue flow from the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>A, the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A and the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, as indicated by an arrowed solid line in the same figure, thereby charging the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>A. Upon subsequent turn on of the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A, the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>A thus charged is made responsible for flowing an output current I<highlight><subscript>out1 </subscript></highlight>through the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A to the load as indicated by a broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. Also, the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>A is responsible for flowing an output current I<highlight><subscript>out3 </subscript></highlight>through the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the load, as indicated another broken line, while the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A is off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows various currents flowing in the circuit of the converter for demonstrating the above circuit operations. In this figure, an input current I<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>is a combination of currents I<highlight><subscript>in1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>in2</subscript></highlight>, and I<highlight><subscript>out3</subscript></highlight>, while the output current I<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>is a combination of the currents I<highlight><subscript>out1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>out2</subscript></highlight>, and I<highlight><subscript>out3 </subscript></highlight>supplied to the load. Currents I<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>and I<highlight><subscript>32 </subscript></highlight>denote those flowing respectively through the primary and secondary windings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A. As confirmed by the waveform of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the converter of this embodiment also assures no interruption in the input current for reducing the input current ripples as well as reducing the input current peak. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a DC-DC converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention which is identical to the second embodiment except that the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B has its winding sense chosen oppositely to that of the second embodiment for flowing input and output currents through the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B and the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B in a reverse direction. Like parts are designated by like reference numerals with a suffix letter of &ldquo;B&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Operation of the converter is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>. When the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B is on, DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supplies an input current I<highlight><subscript>in1 </subscript></highlight>flowing through the primary winding <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B, as indicated by an arrowed solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, to store the energy at the transformer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B. Upon subsequent turn off of the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B, the secondary winding <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B releases its energy to flow a current I<highlight><subscript>out1 </subscript></highlight>through the diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B to the load, as indicated by an arrowed broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>. At the same time, the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>B is cooperative with the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to flow an additional current I<highlight><subscript>out2 </subscript></highlight>to the load. Since the current I<highlight><subscript>out2 </subscript></highlight>flows through the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it can be regarded as an input current which continues to flow, even in the off-period of the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B, from the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the converter, thereby reducing the input current ripples and the input current peak as is made in the previous embodiment. It is noted that during the on-period of the switching element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B, the DC power source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also responsible for flowing a like current I<highlight><subscript>out3 </subscript></highlight>through the smoothing output capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>B to the load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows various currents flowing in the circuit of the above converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B for demonstrating the above circuit operations. In this figure, an input current I<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>is a combination of currents I<highlight><subscript>in1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>in2</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>out2</subscript></highlight>, and I<highlight><subscript>out3</subscript></highlight>, while the output current I<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>is a combination of the currents I<highlight><subscript>out1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>out2</subscript></highlight>, and I<highlight><subscript>out3 </subscript></highlight>supplied to the load. Currents I<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>and I<highlight><subscript>32 </subscript></highlight>denote those flowing respectively through the primary and secondary windings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B. Again as confirmed by the waveform of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the converter of this embodiment also gives no interruption in the input current for reducing the input current ripples as well as reducing the input current peak. </paragraph>
