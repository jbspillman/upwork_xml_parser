<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a gaming machine of the type known as a slot machine or fruit machine. Generally, these types of machines have a series of rotatable reels each of which displays a series of symbols or a video simulation of such a mechanism while other types of machines are arranged to play video simulations of card games or other types of wagering games, such as bingo or keno. More particularly, the invention relates to an improvement to a game played on such a machine. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Players regularly playing gaming machines quickly tire of particular games. Therefore, it is necessary for manufacturers of these machines to develop inventive game features which add interest to the games provided on such machines in order to keep the players entertained and willing to continue to play the games. Gaming machines of the type described are particularly well known nationally and internationally. Substantial amounts of money are wagered on these machines. In the state of NSW and other states of Australia, there is a growing tendency to legalise the use of gaming machines by licensing operators with resulting revenue gains being achieved through licence fees and taxation of moneys invested. The licensed operation of gaming machines is the subject of state legislation and regulation. Amongst the items regulated is the minimum percentage payout for a gaming machine. For example; a minimum of 85% of monies invested must be returned as winnings and manufacturers of gaming machines must therefore design their machines around these regulatory controls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> With the growth that has occurred in the gaming machine market, there is intense competition between manufacturers to supply the various existing and new venues. When selecting a supplier of gaming machines the operator of a venue must pay close attention to the popularity of various games with their patrons. Therefore, gaming machine manufacturers are keen to devise games that are popular with players as a mechanism for improving sales and for maintaining player interest. In this regard, various strategies have been tried in the past to make games more enticing to players including an increase in the number of reels, video simulations of such reels secondary features. or the like. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, there is provided a gaming machine which includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> a control means for controlling operation of the machine; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> a primary display means on which a game to be played is displayed: and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> a secondary display means on which a scorecard, indicating prizes to be paid upon a winning game being achieved, is displayed, the game and the scorecard being controlled by the control means and the scorecard being a dynamic scorecard with at least one of a prize indicated by the scorecard for a particular combination of symbols and a combination of symbols indicated by the scorecard as constituting a prize-winning combination of symbols changing from game to game without player intervention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the scorecard may change depending on the result of a game played. Conversely, the scorecard may affect the result of the game. However, it is not essential that these results occur and changes in the scorecard may be effected independently of any game result and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An animated character may implement changes to the scorecard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is believed that, with a dynamic, interactive scorecard of the type in question, the game will become more interesting for the player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The primary and secondary display means may be displayed on a single screen of the gaming machine. Instead, the primary display means may be displayed on one screen with the secondary display means being displayed on a second screen. For example, the second screen may be arranged in a top box of the gaming machine.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the drawings, reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally designates a gaming machine, in accordance with the invention. The gaming machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a console <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on which a top box <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A first video display unit or screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is mounted in the console <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a second video display unit or screen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is mounted in the top box <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in use, is displayed on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a scorecard (also sometimes referred to as a paytable) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is displayed on the screen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is of the type simulating rotating wheels, card games, other games of chance such as bingo or keno, or the like. For ease of explanation, the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to a video simulation of rotating reels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> displayed on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is controlled by means of buttons <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> arranged in a midtrim <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the gaming machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Various operations are effected by the buttons <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such as, via buttons <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the number of lines to be bet and the number of credits to be bet. respectively. Various meters <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are also displayed on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A first meter 28.1 indicates the credits available to the player as a result of previous wins. A meter 28.2 shows the bets made by the player for a particular game or games and a meter 28.3 shows the amount won by the player as a result of a winning combination of symbols in the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A control system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the gaming machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of the drawings. A program which implements the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is run on a processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the control system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> forms part of a controller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which drives the screens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and which receives input signals from sensors <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The sensors <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> include touch sensors mounted at least in the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and, optionally, in the screen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The sensors <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> cooperate with the buttons <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for causing the reels of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be &ldquo;spun&rdquo;. It will be appreciated that, instead of the buttons <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a pull handle (not shown) arranged on a side of the console <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also receives input pulses from a mechanism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> indicating that the player has provided sufficient credit to begin playing. The mechanism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be a coin input chute, a bill collector, a credit card reader, or other similar types of validation devices. Finally, the controller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also drives a payout mechanism which, for example, may be a coin output for feeding coins to a coin tray <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a dynamic scorecard controlled by the control system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In other words, the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is integrated into a part of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> although control of the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be effected independently of the result of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It is also possible that events happening either consecutively or simultaneously on the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can affect the scorecard and vice versa. It is also intended that the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> determines winning outcomes which may not necessarily be combined with the result of the primary game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the dynamic scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring firstly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> of the drawings, a first embodiment of the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> involves the prizes awarded as a result of a prize winning combination having been achieved on the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being shuffled around the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that the prizes associated with each combination or a subset of the combinations will change. This shuffling of the prizes may happen with every game or, instead, may only happen as a special feature where a specific trigger combination results in the prizes being shuffled either once or a predetermined number of times, for example, for the next ten games. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The shuffling of the prizes on the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may either be random in that each prize could potentially end up being associated with any one of the applicable combinations or the method by which the shuffling occurs may be fixed, for example, the prizes could always move clockwise by one position or a five of a kind combination may swap with a four of a kind combination of the same symbol. Still further, a combination of random and fixed methods could be used such as where the prizes for each combination of a specific symbol always swap randomly with each other only or five of a kind prizes may be shuffled amongst themselves only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Still further, the prize shuffle may relate to the entire scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or to only a portion of the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, there may be a special symbol for which the prizes for each combination will be the only ones that shuffle. Instead, the five of a kind prizes may shuffle over the entire scorecard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> of the drawings, the three of a kind prizes, illustrated at <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, swap positions randomly in respect of each game. As the reels on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> spin, the prizes for the three of a kind combination <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> shuffle continuously around all of the three of a kind combination positions moving very quickly so that none of the applicable prizes remain in position for more than a fraction of a second. When the reels on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> stop spinning, the prizes come to rest in their final positions and if a three of a kind combination exists as a result of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the prize paid will be according to the prize which stopped alongside the relevant winning combination. For example, on the initial scorecard illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the drawings, the prize paid for three of a kind for symbol &ldquo;10&rdquo; was 20 credits. After completion of the shuffling, the prize paid for three of a kind of the symbol &ldquo;10&rdquo; is 100 credits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> of the drawings, another embodiment of the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown in an initial condition and a completed condition, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the prize for a given combination is always completely independent of the prize for another combination. The prizes for all of; or a subset of, the prize combinations are random. As for the embodiment described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> of the drawings, the random prizes could occur every game or as feature triggered by a specific event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The random prizes in this embodiment are preferably selected from different ranges depending upon the combination to which they apply. This can be achieved by using spinning reels on the screen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to display the prizes on the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with the number of reels and digits displayed on the reels varying depending on the combination to which they apply. For example, a five of a kind win for a top symbol can be guaranteed to give a prize of at least 4 digits by using 4 spinning reels with no zero on the first reel. Also, for added player suspense the spinning reels that represent the prizes stop in order from right to left instead of from left to right. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> One implementation of this embodiment (not illustrated) is where spinning reels are used in respect of all of the prizes. When the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> commences on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the reels constituting the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also commence spinning. They continue to spin as each of the reels on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> stop spinning. For every prize winning combination that was spun up on the reels of the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the appropriate scorecard reels will stop spinning one by one and reveal the appropriate prize. Prizes for combinations that were not revealed on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are not relevant and hence do not need to be revealed on the screen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> of the drawings, only prizes in respect of the scatter symbol &ldquo;S&rdquo; are variable and constituted by spinning reels <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the layout of the reels <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> for the scatter symbol &ldquo;S&rdquo; are shown. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the layout is shown after completion of a game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the reel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thus, for four of a kind of the symbol &ldquo;S&rdquo;, a prize of 369 credits is paid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> of the drawings, a further embodiment of the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown. In this embodiment, the prize reels concept is extended to allow symbol combinations themselves to be variable. The example illustrated is for a near-miss opportunity to give a second chance at a winning combination by somehow changing the winning combinations of the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, for example, by re-spinning the reels on the screen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> constituting the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In so doing, the chances are improved that a near-miss will result in a winning payout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Thus, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> of the drawings, the prize for a combination of <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> X K is <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as shown at <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> of the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If a game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is played on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which results in a combination of K.K.<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. -. - coming up on a payline, it is regarded as a &ldquo;near-miss&rdquo; of <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> X K. Hence, the third king in the same combination on the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will respin for a chance at revealing a <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> of the drawings and hence allowing the player to be paid for the near-miss scenario. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The same principle can also be applied to a &ldquo;spin-for-five&rdquo; type concept. For example, the player may spin up a four of a kind combination on a payline of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Then, instead of the fifth reel of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being spun again, the fifth reel of the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is spun. If the symbol displayed on the fifth reel of the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> then corresponds with the fifth symbol on the payline of the game, the prize for five of a kind is paid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> of the drawings, a mystery combination is used as illustrated at <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This mystery combination <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided in addition to the standard scorecard. The set of prizes awarded will have their symbols vary from game to game. The mystery symbol reels <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will spin while the reels on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in respect of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> spin. After the reels on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> have stopped spinning, the mystery combination will be revealed by stopping the symbol reels one by one. If a mystery combination <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> matches that on a payline of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the appropriate prize will be paid. This feature could be activated for every game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or else only for a losing spin of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments of the invention, the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may pay prizes which are dynamic and vary from game to game. For example, in one game, the prize for <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> X K may be an amount which is a multiple of one hundred depending on the prize displayed by the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> once the reels on the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stop. This can be implemented either prior to the reels stopping or after stopping of the reels. Thus once <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> X K appears on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> a meter alongside <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> X K on the secondary display on the screen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> increases from one hundred to one hundred x y where y is a value that is randomly chosen. For example, y may be an integer between one and ten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Further, when a special symbol appears, for example, on the third reel on a centre line of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a corresponding symbol appears on the screen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and randomly indicates a combination. If, for example, the symbol on the screen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> indicates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> X Q on the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the reels of the game <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are then re-spun so that <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> X Q are displayed with the resultant prize paid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Also, the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the screen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> could indicate the type of pay from game to game played on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. For example, the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> could indicate that for one game the payout will be from left to right on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, in another game the payout will be from right to left on the screen <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and in yet another game the payout will be either way, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that, instead of spinning reels on the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an animated character, such as the applicant&apos;s &ldquo;Mr Cashman&rdquo;, could be used to implement changes on the scorecard <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Thus, rather than spinning reels on the scorecard, Mr Cashman may manipulate the scorecard by throwing numbers/symbols, painting them on, carrying them around, or similar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Hence, it is an advantage of the invention that a gaming machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided which has an interactive dynamic scorecard resulting in more entertainment for players of the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. </paragraph>
