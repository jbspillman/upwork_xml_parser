<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a gear shift device for vehicles with a mechanical, manually operable gearbox which is provided between an engine and driving wheels for the vehicle, wherein the gearbox can be operated by means of a gear lever, which is linked to a signal transmitter, which is connected via a transmission device to a signal receiver for movement of components of the gearbox for engagement or disengagement of gears, and the gear lever is arranged to be brought from a position wherein a gear is engaged, to a position wherein another gear is engaged, via a neutral position, i.e. a position wherein no gear is engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Gear shift devices of the above-mentioned type are known from the prior art. For example, from NO 171426 a gear shift device is known, wherein the signal transmitter is composed of two hydraulic master cylinders, which can be operated by means of the gear lever. The connecting device comprises hydraulic lines, and the signal receiver comprises two hydraulic slave cylinders. The gear lever has a knob which can be moved along an H-shaped path with two parallel legs which are connected to a path portion extending across the legs. When the knob is moved along the transverse portion and one of the slave cylinders is operated by means of one of the master cylinders, it is moved from one leg to the other. The gears can be engaged by moving the knob from the transverse path portion to the ends of the respective legs. The second slave cylinder is hereby operated by the second master cylinder. When the knob is located on the transverse path portion, the engine is thereby not operationally connected to the driving wheels and this position of the knob can also be called a neutral position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, from U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,551 a mechanical, multistage, automatic gearbox is known, where the gear shift devices comprise an electronic control device which is arranged to receive signals from a number of sensors which measure driving parameters such as engine rotational frequency and power, vehicle speed, etc., and depending on the measurements determines which gear ratio is best and selects a corresponding gear. With such automatic gearboxes, moreover, a semi-automatic mode of operation may often be chosen, where, by operating an electrical switch, the vehicle&apos;s driver can select a gear, which is then engaged automatically, i.e. without special operation of a clutch pedal or accelerator, the gearbox and possibly the clutch being operated by an electronically controlled, mechanical device which performs the change of gear in the gearbox and the clutch. In the event of a failure in the electrical system or a failure of the mechanical device, a gearbox of this type cannot be operated, either in the automatic or the semi-automatic mode of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is to provide a gear shift device for a gearbox of the type mentioned in the introduction, where by means of the gear lever the vehicle&apos;s driver can choose between a manual mode of operation and an automatic mode of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the manual mode of operation gears are engaged by means of a gear lever via a mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic device or a combination of such devices which connect the gear lever to the gearbox, and via which a desired gear can be engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the automatic mode of operation suitable gears are engaged in accordance with either engine and driving parameter values which have been measured by means of a number of sensors (wholly automatic mode of operation), or with information of signals which have been supplied by the driver by means of the gear lever (semi-automatic mode of operation), this information being transferred to an electronic control device which in turn effects the engagement of suitable gears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> By means of the device according to the invention the object can be achieved that the gearbox can be operated even in the event of an electrical failure of the components included in the device which provides the automatic shifting of gears or a failure of the electrical supply thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Features characterising the gear shift device according to the invention will be apparent in the claims.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in the description below, the term &ldquo;up&rdquo; should be understood to refer to the direction towards the edge of the drawing facing away from the reader, and the term &ldquo;forward&rdquo; should be understood as the direction of the arrow F, this direction also being understood to indicate the vehicle&apos;s longitudinal direction and direction of movement while driving forwards. The terms &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;left&rdquo; should be understood to refer to the directions to the right and left respectively of a person looking in the direction of the arrow F. The term &ldquo;transverse direction&rdquo; should be understood to refer to a direction extending horizontally and across the longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the gear shift device comprises a gear lever <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose lower end is linked to a chassis <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a vehicle (not shown), and whose upper end is provided with a knob <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The gear lever <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to a first, double-acting hydraulic master cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which extends in the transverse direction and which is connected via hydraulic lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with a first, double-acting slave cylinder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is mounted on a gearbox <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and which similarly extends in the transverse direction. The gear lever <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is further connected with a second, double-acting hydraulic master cylinder <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which extends in the longitudinal direction and which is connected via hydraulic lines <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with a second, double-acting slave cylinder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The slave cylinder has pistons (not shown) which are connected with components of the gearbox which by means of movement of the pistons effect engagement or disengagement of gears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The first master cylinders <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> form a signal transmitter, which via the lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which constitute a transmission device, transmits signals to the slave cylinders <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which constitute a signal receiver. It will be appreciated that other devices may be employed for transmitting information from a gear lever to the gearbox. For example, instead of hydraulic components as signal transmitters, transmission devices and signal receivers, pneumatic or mechanical devices such as bell cranks, rods, wire ropes, etc. may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The gearbox <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is connected to an engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via a clutch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and connected to the driving wheels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the vehicle via a number of shafts <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the gear lever&apos;s knob is arranged to be moved backwards and forwards in a path comprising a number of path portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the direction of the double arrow Y, which also indicates the longitudinal direction, and in a path portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the direction of the double arrow X which also indicates the transverse direction. The resulting movement of the slave cylinders <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is indicated by the double arrows X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When the gear lever knob <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is moved along the path portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, only the first master cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the associated slave cylinder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are operated. The knob hereby passes adjacent, first ends of the longitudinal path portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> without any components being moved which effect an engagement of gears in the gearbox. The gearbox is therefore constantly in a neutral position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> If the gear lever knob <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, after having been moved to the first end of one of the longitudinal path portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> when the first master cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is operated, is moved to the other end of this path portion when the second master cylinder <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the associated slave cylinder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are operated, one of four gears G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-G<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for moving the vehicle forward, or a gear R for moving the vehicle backwards can be engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> While engaging the gears, the driver operates in the usual manner a clutch pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is connected to a third, single-acting hydraulic master cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. This master cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is connected via a hydraulic line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to a third, single-acting hydraulic slave cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for disengaging and engaging the clutch <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With manual gearboxes, servo devices (not shown) may be provided in the known manner to assist the driver during engagement or disengagement of the gears by means of the gear lever and for operation of the clutch. With the device according to the invention, a servo device of this kind may, for example, be connected to each slave cylinder. The servo device may then comprise a pneumatic cylinder which, when a gear has to be engaged, can be supplied with compressed air from a compressed air source in the vehicle, thus helping to facilitate the engagement of the gear. When using such servo devices, however, there will still be a need to exercise a relatively great amount of muscle power in order to perform gear changes or operation of the clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> If servo devices are used in connection with the device according to the invention, it should be understood that these too can be operated even in the event of an electrical failure as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the gear lever <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be moved transversely in the direction of the double arrow X to one end of the transverse path portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, to a position A. In this position, the gear lever or a component which is moved together with it, influences a first sensor device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which is arranged to transmit a signal to a preferably electronic control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for implementation of an automatic operation of the gearbox <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A second sensor device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is also provided which is arranged to measure values of driving parameters on which an automatic gear shift may depend, such as engine rotational frequency and power, vehicle speed, etc. and to transmit corresponding signals to the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> There is further provided a third sensor device <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> comprising a sensor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which can be influenced when the knob is moved transversely backwards from the position A to a position A&minus;, and a sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which can be influenced when the knob is moved forwards from the position A to a position A&plus;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Based on signals received from the sensor devices <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is arranged to transmit electrical signals to a setting device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The setting device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is arranged to control the supply of a hydraulic pressure fluid via hydraulic lines <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>&prime;,<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> to a first, second and third valve device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> respectively from a hydraulic unit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The valve devices <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are inserted in the hydraulic lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> between the master cylinders <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the respective slave cylinders <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and are arranged to break a connection or re-establish a broken connection between the master cylinders and the slave cylinders. Furthermore, the valve devices <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are arranged to control the supply of hydraulic fluid to the slave cylinders <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> via the setting device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from the hydraulic unit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for operation of the slave cylinders according to signals transmitted by the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the setting device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be an electronic computer which may be provided with a suitable computer program for controlling valves of the valve devices <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, with the result that the slave cylinders <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> effect engagement of the appropriate gears during appropriate operation of the clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It will also be understood, however, that there may be provided in the known per se manner additional sensors (not shown) which are arranged to provide values of additional parameters concerning, e.g., the rotational frequency of shafts in the gearbox, the torque transmitted by these shafts, etc. Values of these parameters may be supplied to the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which automatically effects an engagement of gears, e.g. when shafts which have to be connected have the same rotational frequency and are not transmitting any torque, thus eliminating the need for operation of the clutch in the automatic mode of operation. Components such as a valve device <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and a hydraulic line <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> for automatic operation of the clutch may then be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The setting device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the valve devices <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and possibly <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are arranged to break the connection between the master cylinders and the slave cylinders and to control hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic unit to the slave cylinders depending on signals from the control device for automatic engagement of gears. In what follows, however, only the assembly comprising the valve devices <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for breaking the connection between the slave cylinders <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the master cylinders <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via the lines <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>&prime;,<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime; for engaging gears will be described as a switch device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a connection diagram illustrating the interconnection of components of the device according to the invention, where a person skilled in the art will understand the mode of operation of the components based on this diagram, and where the reference numerals indicate components which have been described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the first master cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is arranged to influence the first sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which, as indicated by the letter C, an arrow facing away from the sensor and by broken lines, is arranged to transmit a signal to the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when the sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is influenced by the gear lever in its position A. There is further illustrated a second master cylinder <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which is arranged to influence the sensors <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which in turn are similarly arranged to transmit signals to the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, as indicated only by the letter C and arrows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the pairs of hydraulic lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> connecting the master cylinders <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with the slave cylinders <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, there is inserted a first valve device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a second valve device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the hydraulic line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connecting the clutch master cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with the clutch slave cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> there is inserted a third valve device <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The valve devices are spring-loaded to a position wherein they create a connection between the master cylinders and the slave cylinders. Should the power supply fail, gears can thus be engaged manually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the setting device there are provided a first, second and third adjustment valve <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> respectively, whereby a pressure fluid can be conveyed from a hydraulic unit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to the valve devices <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. These setting valves <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> can be controlled by the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> via electrical wires, as indicated by broken lines and arrows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When the valve devices <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the lines <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> have been brought into a position, wherein they break the connection between the master cylinders and establish a corresponding connection with the first and the second adjustment valves <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, by means of an appropriate operation of the setting valves <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> a desired movement of the slave cylinders <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be achieved for automatic engagement of gears.

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> If the gearbox is arranged to be operated by a gear lever which can be moved in an H-like pattern with several pairs of legs, it must be possible to stop the first slave cylinder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at several points between the ends of its full stroke. For this purpose there may be provided a number of position sensors <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, two of which are illustrated, at these points. When this slave cylinder&apos;s piston has reached one of these points, the sensor at the point concerned can transmit a signal to the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which in turn transmits a signal to the setting valve <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to stop the supply of hydraulic fluid to this slave cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the same way, in order, e.g., to restrict their strokes, a number of position sensors <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> respectively may be provided for the second slave cylinder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the third slave cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, two sensors being illustrated for each master cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Since the clutch slave cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is single-acting, there is a need for only one line to the associated valve device <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which can be connected alternately to a pressure line and a return line from the hydraulic unit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The mode of operation of these valve devices is otherwise evident from the standard symbols employed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When the vehicle is stationary and the driver wishes to set it in motion backwards, he can disengage the clutch by means of the clutch pedal and select the gear R, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, whereupon he engages the clutch in the same way as in a manual mode of operation for the gearbox and the clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the vehicle is stationary and the driver wishes to set the vehicle in motion forwards, he can disengage the clutch and select the gear G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If the driver wishes the gearbox to continue working in manual mode of operation, he can then change gear in the same way as is normal for manual gearboxes by selecting the gears G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-G<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> If, after having set the vehicle in motion forwards, the driver wishes the gearbox to function in automatic operation mode, he moves the gear lever knob <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the position A, thus influencing the first sensor device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The sensor device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> then transmits a signal to the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which in turn transmits a signal to the setting device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for breaking the connection between the master cylinders <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the respective slave cylinders <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> then undertakes the selection of gear depending on the driving parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> By moving the knob <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> forward to the position A&plus; or A&minus;, thereby influencing either the sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or the sensor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the gear shift device is transferred to a semi-automatic mode of operation, where by means of repeated movement of the knob between A and A&plus; successive gear shifts are obtained to progressively higher gears every time the knob reaches the position A&plus; until the knob, for example, remains in this position. In the same way, successive gear shifts are obtained to progressively lower gears when by means of repeated movement the knob is moved between A and A&minus; and the knob reaches the position A&minus; until the knob remains in this position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Should the driver wish to operate the gearbox manually, at any time during the wholly or semi-automatic mode of operation he can move the knob to the portion of the transverse path portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> located on the left of the position A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The connection is thereby broken with the sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> which transmits a corresponding signal to the control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The control device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> then effects a re-establishment of the connections between the master cylinders <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the slave cylinders <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, thus permitting a manual operation of the gearbox and the clutch. </paragraph>
