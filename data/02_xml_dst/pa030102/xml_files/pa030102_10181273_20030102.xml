<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to methods of forming metal wiring and semiconductor manufacturing apparatuses for forming metal wiring, and more particularly, to a method of embedding metal wiring into a concave part formed in an object body of manufacturing processes of a semiconductor integrated circuit such as a semiconductor wafer and to a semiconductor manufacturing apparatus for such forming metal wiring. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, various steps in a manufacturing process of a semiconductor integrated circuit, such as a forming a film step, an oxidation diffusion step, an etching step and others are repeated to be carried out on a surface of a semiconductor wafer which is an object body of the above-mentioned processes. A concave part such as a contact hole or through hole is formed during the manufacturing process of the semiconductor integrated circuit. There is a tendency that a metal tungsten film formed by a chemical vapor deposition method (CVD method) is mostly utilized to be embedded into the concave part. The metal tungsten film formed by the CVD method has a high covering ability, a robustness of the wire snapping, and a low specific resistance and is relatively easy to be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is general, as a method of forming a film of the metal tungsten, to supply a WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(tungsten hexafluoride) gas as an ingredient gas including a tungsten and a H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(hydrogen) gas as a reduction gas, to reduce WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>by H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in a state of a temperature in a range between 400 and 450&deg; C., and to form a film of the metal tungsten on a TiN (titanium nitride) film as a base film mainly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The TiN film formed by a physical vapor deposition method (PVD method) or a CVD method is generally utilized as a base film because of the following reasons. Firstly, it is necessary to form a film of tungsten equally on a whole of a surface of the wafer. This is because metal tungsten formed by a H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>reduction method has different rates of forming a film on between a metal surface and an insulator surface. Secondly, the base film is necessary as a barrier preventing WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>which is an ingredient of tungsten from encroaching a lower layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A conventional process of forming the metal tungsten will be described as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> During the process of forming a film of metal tungsten, if the film is attempted to be formed by the CVD method from the beginning of the process, it is hard to stick the film on the surface of the wafer and there is a tendency in that an incubation time becomes long. In order to prevent the above-described state, firstly a WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas as an ingredient gas, a H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas as a reduction gas, a SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(monosilane) gas, and the like are flown a small amount each, so that a nucleus making layer of tungsten which is a crystal seed is grown on the surface of the wafer. Next, the large amount of the above-mentioned ingredient gas or the reduction gas is flown, thereby the tungsten film is grown at high growth rate on the nucleus making layer as a seed. Thus, the tungsten film having designated thickness can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a graph showing a relation between a process time and a film thickness in the above-mentioned film forming process. Following the pre-process, a nucleus making layer forming step is carried out. At a first part of the nucleus making layer forming step starts, the film does not stick for a period of time, namely for an incubation time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, at a first part of the a main tungsten film forming step starts following to the nucleus making layer forming step, a film does not stick for a period of time, namely for an incubation time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. After the incubation time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the large amount of the tungsten film is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, recently, it becomes more difficult to embed the metal film into a contact hole or a through hole such as a via-hole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a result of that a semiconductor integrated circuit becomes minute and high integrated. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is a main way to utilize a MOCVD-TiN (metal organic CVD-TiN) film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is refined by a plasma step from a CVD film for which an organic Ti (titanium) source is utilized, as a base barrier film of the via-hole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> used for particularly wiring in upper layers. It is not possible to obtain a sufficient covering ability of the base barrier film by the PVD method. A carbon is an impurity and stays inside of the film due to that an organic material is utilized as an ingredient of the CVD film. By the plasma step, it is possible to throw the carbon out after the film is formed, so that a purity and density of the film can be heighten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The CVD-W film forming was carried out conventionally to the PVD-TiN film or the inorganic CVD-TiN film for which TiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is utilized. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, a tungsten film having a high quality can be formed on the base barrier film by such the CVD-W film forming, because an upper plane surface and a base part of a hole are refined sufficiently by reaching plasma thereon. However, as a fundamental nature with regard to the plasma, it is difficult for the plasma to reach the side wall of the hole. Hence, refining by the plasma may not be sufficient and it may be difficult to form a film of the tungsten thereon. Thereby, even if the film of the tungsten is formed, the tungsten film may have a low quality and the tungsten film may not be embedded into the hole sufficiently. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A description will now be given, with reference to the drawings, of embodiments of the present invention. In respective figures, parts that are the same or the substantially same as the parts shown in other figures are given the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Inventors of the present invention experimented to obtain a method in that a tungsten is embedded into a via-hole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> satisfactorily by a CVD method, even if a MO-TiN film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> including impurities, as a base barrier film, is formed inside the via-hole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result of the experiment, the inventors realized that it was possible to form a tungsten wiring part having a sufficient embedding ability as a whole, in case of that an extremely thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the tungsten having a satisfactory covering ability was formed before the tungsten was embedded into the hole by the CVD method as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The inventors also realized that a main tungsten film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> was formed on the extremely thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as a nucleus making layer as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The inventors further realized the tungsten layer having a high covering ability could be achieved by the followings for forming the tungsten extremely thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Firstly, an ingredient gas such as a WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas, a SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas or the like, was supplied in sequence. After the ingredient gas which might be reacted each other was supplied in sequence, namely after the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas or the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas was supplied in sequence, vacuum-exhausting the ingredient gas or substituting the ingredient gas by the other gas such as Ar (argon), N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(nitride), or H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(hydrogen) was implemented respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> That is, a WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas reached a base part of the hole sufficiently. The gas was absorbed on a surface of an object of forming a film. And then, the only absorption layer having an equal thickness decided by the temperature and the pressure was formed by a vacuum-exhaustion or substitution process. After a surplus WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas was removed, the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas was supplied, thereby only absorbed WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>reacted with SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>so that a tungsten layer was formed. According to the present invention, the ingredient gas was consumed not only on an upper part of the hole but also at the base part of the hole. Hence, the tungsten layer could have highly satisfactory covering ability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a schematic structure view showing a vacuum process apparatus to carry out a method of forming a tungsten wiring part according to the present invention. A vacuum process apparatus for carrying out the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A vacuum process apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, for example, is made of aluminum and has a cylinder shape. A reflector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, having a cylinder shape and extending perpendicularly from a base part of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, is provided inside of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A support member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having L shape is mounted on the reflector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. A load stand <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for loading a semiconductor wafer W which is an object body of the process is mounted on an upper surface of the support member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The load stand <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is comprised of a high thermal conductive material such as a carbon material, AlN (aluminum nitride) or the like having a thickness of several mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A permeation window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made of quartz is arranged tightly on the base part of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is just under the load stand <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A heat room <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a box shape is arranged, as surrounding the permeation window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, just under the permeation window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The heat room <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of heating lumps <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provided on the rotating stand <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which also serves as a reflection mirror. The rotating stand <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotated by a rotating motor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Therefore, heat rays radiated from the heating lumps <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are irradiated on a bottom surface of the load stand <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the permeation window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Hence, the wafer W on the load stand <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is heated indirectly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In a step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a wafer W is carried into the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by opening a gate valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> provided on a side wall of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and utilizing a carrying arm not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. At this time, the heating lump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is set in advance as having a designated temperature, for instance as the wafer W has a temperature of 300&deg; C., and the wafer W is loaded on the load stand <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> heated with a designated temperature. A via-hole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a base barrier film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> made of MO-TiN are formed on a surface of the wafer W in advance, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> following the step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, Ar or N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is supplied from the gas source to the shower head part <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> keeps a designated pressure, for instance 400 Pa, and the inside of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is exhausted. Hence, a heat from the load stand <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is conducted to the wafer W, thereby the temperature of the wafer W arises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In a step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> following the step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, supplying a gas is stopped. Inside of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is evacuated until the pressure of the inside of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> becomes for example 10 Pa and under. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In a step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> following the step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a gas formed by mixing the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas and a little amount of the Ar and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gases is supplied to the shower head part <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the inside of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is kept at designated pressure and exhausted. Thereby, the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas is supplied by 150 Pa sec on the wafer W substantially equally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In a step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> following the step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, supplying a gas is stopped and the inside of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is evacuated and exhausted until inside of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> becomes for example 10 Pa and under. During this step, only an absorption layer of the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>, having an equal thickness based on the temperature and the pressure, is stayed behind on an upper surface, a side surface, and a bottom surface of the via-hole of the wafer W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In a step <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> following the step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a gas formed by mixing the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas and a little amount of Ar and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas is supplied to the shower head part <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the inside of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is kept at designated pressure and exhausted. Thereby, the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas is supplied by 70 Pa sec on the wafer W substantially equally. During this step, the absorption layer of the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>stayed behind in step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and having a substantially equal thickness is reduced by the SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, so that the tungsten film (W film) of a molecule layer level, is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In a step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> following the step <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, supplying a gas is stopped and the inside of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is evacuated and exhausted until the inside of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> becomes for example 10 Pa and under. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in a step <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the steps <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are repeated to carry out designated numbers of cycles such as 17 cycles, until the extremely tungsten thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a designated thickness such as 1 nm as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As described above, after the tungsten extremely thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a designated thickness is formed, in a step <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a main tungsten film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed. The main tungsten film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed by a normal CVD method as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> on the tungsten extremely thin film as a nucleus making layer. After forming the main tungsten film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is completed, in a step <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the gate valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> provided on the side wall of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is opened and then the wafer W is carried out of the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by the carrying arm not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to an operation, as a result of the experiment by inventors, by a scanning electron microscope about the cross section of the wafer W in which step <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is completed, sufficient embedding into the via-hole having a diameter of 0.2 &mgr;m and a depth of 1.0 &mgr;m could be achieved without any defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The above embodiment, for forming the tungsten extremely thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, shows an example of evacuating and exhausting at an interval of supplying WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. After supplying the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>or SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas is stopped, purge may be implemented. In the purge, a large amount, such as 200 sc cm and more, of the flow of an inert gas, such as Ar or N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, is supplied, thereby the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>or SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas in the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is pushed out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> For instance, according to the experiment by inventors, the purge was implemented by the following steps in a state where the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> had an inside pressure of 1000 Pa and the wafer had a temperature of 350&deg; C. That is, in a step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas was supplied by 38 Pa sec; the Ar gas was supplied by 3816 Pa sec; and the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas was supplied by 1145 Pa sec. Next, in a step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the Ar gas was supplied by 2308 Pa sec; and the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas was supplied by 692 Pa sec. Furthermore, in a step <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas was supplied by 112 Pa; the Ar gas was supplied by 3759 Pa sec; and the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas was supplied by 1127 Pa sec. Next, in a step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the Ar gas was supplied by 2308 Pa sec; and the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas was supplied by 692 Pa sec. In a step <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, steps <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> were repeated to carry out 6 cycles, thereby an extremely tungsten thin film having 7.0 nm was obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It is effective to supply H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>when the tungsten extremely thin film should not be oxidized. In case of that the &ldquo;vacuum-exhaustion&mdash;purge&mdash;vacuum-exhaustion&rdquo; is utilized as one set, although a whole of a time for forming a film becomes long, there is an advantage in that a residual gas of the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>or SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas can be removed greatly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, in case of that the tungsten extremely thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed, firstly WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is supplied without implementing a pre-process, after the wafer W is loaded in the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The pre-process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be implemented after the wafer W is loaded in the process vessel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and before the tungsten extremely thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As the pre-process, for instance, the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas may be flown on the surface of the wafer. For instance, the incubation time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the time of that the tungsten extremely thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed can be reduced by supplying the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas by 7000 Pa sec. According to the above-mentioned embodiment which does not include the pre-process, a cycle of supplying the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas and the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas is repeated seventeen times for forming 1 nm of a thickness of the tungsten extremely thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Thirteen cycles in the seventeen cycles correspond to the incubation time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and no film of the tungsten extremely thin film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed therein. Forming a film starts from the fourteenth cycle and 1 nm of a thickness of the tungsten extremely thin film is formed for four cycles until the seventeenth cycle is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the pre-process, by supplying the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas by 7000 Pa sec, number of cycles corresponding to the incubation time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reduced from thirteen to three. Thus, forming a film starts from fourth cycle, so that the total cycles of supplying the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>for forming the tungsten extremely thin film having 1 nm of the film thickness is reduced to seven cycles. Thus, it is preferable to do pre-process because a whole of time for forming a film is greatly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In case of that the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas flow is supplied by 1 kPa sec and more, the incubation time is reduced. If the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas is supplied by more than 25 kPa sec, a through-put is reduced because the process time becomes long and a particle occurs because the pressure of SiH4 becomes high. Therefore, the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas flow may be preferable to be supplied by 25 kPa sec and less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As a requirement for forming the tungsten thin film, 300&deg; C. of the temperature of the wafer, supplying the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>by 150 Pa sec, supplying the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas by 70 Pa sec, and 0.25 nm of amount of forming a film in one cycle, are shown in the above embodiment. Inventors, however, realized the following relations shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after considering the method of the forming of the tungsten extremely thin film variously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a view showing a relation of the temperature of the wafer and the film thickness in one cycle. In case of that the wafer has a temperature in a range between 150&deg; C. and 350&deg; C., the film has a substantially constant thickness in a range between 0.23 nm to 0.28 nm in one cycle regardless of the wafer temperature, under some conditions. In case of that the wafer has a temperature in a range between 380&deg; C. and 500&deg; C., the film has a substantially constant thickness in a range between 0.55 nm to 0.6 nm in one cycle regardless of the wafer temperature under some conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In these ranges, a reaction improves as a rate-determining step of the absorption of the ingredient. In these ranges, the tungsten extremely thin film having a satisfactory control ability and covering ability can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to an experiment implemented by inventors, it was found that if the wafer has a temperature of a range of between 355&deg; C. and 500&deg; C., the tungsten extremely thin film having a satisfactory control ability and covering ability can be achieved as well as the wafer has a temperature of a range of between 380&deg; C. and 500&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a view showing a relation of the amount of supplying the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and the film thickness in one cycle. A result of the experiment, in which 300&deg; C. of the wafer temperature is a representative of a range between 150&deg; C. and 350&deg; C. of the wafer temperature and 410&deg; C. of the wafer temperature is a representative of a range between 380&deg; C. and 500&deg; C. of the wafer temperature, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in case of the wafer has a temperature in a range between 150&deg; C. and 350&deg; C., the film thickness in one cycle is saturated when the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is supplied by 66 Pa sec and more. Also, in case of the wafer has a temperature in a range between 380&deg; C. and 500&deg; C., the film thickness in one cycle is saturated when the SiH4 is supplied by 333 Pa sec and more. In these saturated ranges, reactions improve as a rate-determining step of the absorption of the ingredient. In these ranges, the tungsten extremely thin film having a satisfactory control ability and covering ability can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> According to an experiment implemented by inventors, it was found that if the SiH4 is supplied by 13 Pa sec and more in case of the wafer has a temperature in a range between 150&deg; C. and 350&deg; C., and the SiH4 is supplied by 40 Pa sec and more in case of the wafer has a temperature in a range between 380&deg; C. and 500&deg; C., the tungsten extremely thin film having a satisfactory control ability and covering ability can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a view showing a relation of the temperature of the wafer and the film thickness of WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>in one cycle. A result of the experiment, in which 300&deg; C. of the wafer temperature is a representative of a range between 150&deg; C. and 350&deg; C. of the wafer temperature and 410&deg; C. of the wafer temperature is a representative of a range between 380&deg; C. and 500&deg; C. of the wafer temperature, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In these saturated ranges, the film thickness in one cycle is saturated and reactions improve as a rate-determining step of the absorption of the ingredient in case of that WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is supplied by 133 Pa sec and more. In these ranges, the tungsten extremely thin film having a satisfactory control ability and covering ability can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> According to an experiment implemented by inventors, it was found that if the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is supplied by 5 Pa sec and more, the tungsten extremely thin film having a satisfactory control ability and covering ability can be achieved as well as the WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is supplied by 133 Pa sec and more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> If the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>are supplied by more than 10 kPa sec, it takes too much time for one cycle, so that a throughput is reduced. Besides, in this case, since the SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>are supplied too much, SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>may likely to be stayed so that it is difficult to substitute the gases. Hence, it is preferable that upper limits of the supplying SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>are respectively by 10 kPa sec or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The present invention does not limit the case of that the tungsten extremely thin film has 1 nm of the film thickness as mentioned above. Rather, it is preferable that the film has a thickness in a range between 0.2 nm and 20.0 nm. The film having a thickness of less than 0.2 nm is not preferable because the film thickness is too thin partially and the film may not serve as the nucleus making layer. The film having a thickness of more than 20.0 nm has no problem in terms of a function of the nucleus making layer. However, the film having a thickness of more than 20.0 nm is not preferable because the time for forming a whole of a film is increased so that the through put is reduced. On the other hand, if the film has a thickness in a range between 0.2 nm and 20.0 nm, it serves as the nucleus making layer efficiently and through put is not largely reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The above embodiment shows an example of forming the tungsten wiring part in the via-hole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, the present invention is not limited to a state where the wiring material is tungsten, but various variations and modifications such as using other materials may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
