<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a system for protecting a helicopter, or at least parts thereof, from the elements and particularly from the sun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4613096 discloses a helicopter protector which uses a sheet of protective covering material which is draped over a main rotor blade of a helicopter and which is pegged to the ground to provide a tent-like structure. This does provide a degree of protection although it is somewhat cumbersome to make use of the protector. Another disadvantage is that the protector is primarily intended for use with a two blade rotor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention provides, in the first instance, a protection system for a helicopter with at least three main rotor blades which includes at least one flexible panel with first and second edges, and first and second attachment devices, on the said first and second edges respectively, for engagement with two of the rotor blades so that the panel extends between these rotor blades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The panel may be supported by, and extend between, the rotor blades substantially in a horizontal orientation. Means may be provided for tensioning the panel, if necessary. Such tensioning means may for example include elastic devices such as springs, rubber strips or the like which impart a degree of tension between at least parts of the panel and relatively fixed structure such as a rotor blade or an adjacent panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Each attachment device, on the panel, may take on any appropriate form. The invention is not limited in this regard. For example each attachment device may comprise a plurality of spaced rings or loops which are engaged with a respective blade. Preferably however each attachment device includes an elongate sock in which a respective blade is at least partly received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As used herein the word &ldquo;sock&rdquo; includes a tubular-like structure into which at least a portion of a blade is insertable. The tubular structure may be continuous in the sense that it is formed from sheet material or it may be discontinuous in the sense that it is formed from a number of bands or loops through which a blade is threaded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Each sock may include a fastener for closing the sock along an elongate path, or opening the sock along the said elongate path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The fastener may take on any suitable form and the invention is not limited in this regard. Preferably the fastener is selected from the following: at least one zip fastener; a plurality of spaced fixing devices; at least one hook and pile fastener eg. of the type sold under the trade mark Velcro. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention the fastener comprises an elongate zip fastener which extends substantially the entire length of the sock. The zip fastener, when released, opens the sock along the elongate path and, as the zip fastener is closed, the sock is closed thereby enveloping the blade inside the sock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The panel may be formed integrally with at least one of the attachment devices. Thus the panel may be formed integrally with a sock or with both socks. Alternatively the panel is detachably engagable with at least one of the attachment devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a preferred form of the invention each attachment device comprises a respective sock which is separable from the panel. Each sock includes an elongate fastener such as a zip fastener Each sock is then separately engagable with a respective blade. Each sock, in turn, is engagable with a respective edge of the panel using a further fastener which, preferably, is selected from the following: at least one zip fastener; a plurality of spaced fixing devices; at least one hook and pile fastener such as that sold under the name Velcro. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Where use is made of spaced fixing devices these may be in the nature of buttons, hook and eye formations, small zips, fastening bands or loops, or any other suitable fixing device which can be engaged with a rotor blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably each panel includes a safety shear strip. The shear strip may take on any suitable form and, in a generalised sense, comprises or includes a line or lines of weakness. The panel may for example comprise two sections which are joined to one another by the shear strip using a suitable fastener or fasteners such as small lengths of hook and pile strips (Velcro strips) or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention extends, in the second instance, to a protection system for a helicopter with at least three main rotor blades which includes a first sock in which a first blade is locatable, a second sock in which a second blade is locatable, and a flexible cover which is secured to, and which extends between, the first and second socks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The invention also extends to a panel for use in a helicopter protection system which includes a cover made from a flexible sheet material, a safety shear strip which extends between two sections of the cover, and first and second attachment devices on respective first and second edges of the cover.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings illustrates in plan a helicopter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a main rotor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which includes, in this case, four main rotor blades <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also illustrates a flexible panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which comprises a cover made from a flexible sheet material and which consists of a first section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a second section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The first and second sections are joined together by means of a safety shear strip <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The shear strip <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is, in essence, a line of weakness. The shear strip may take on any appropriate form. In one example of the invention the shear strip is formed by perforating or weakening the panel along the line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in such a way that when the panel is subjected to a predetermined force it will tear or shear along the line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In another form of the invention the sections <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are separately formed and are attached to one another at regular intervals by means of small strips of material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which embody interengagable hook and pile formations eg. of the type sold under the name Velcro. This type of material is known in the art and consequently is not further described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a first edge <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a second edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which, in this example, is substantially at right angles to the first edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An inset drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an elongate zip fastener <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The zip fastener is of a robust construction and, generally, is of a type used in tents, camping equipment and the like in that the fastener has two halves which are completely detachable from each other. One half of the fastener extends along the first edge <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and is indicated by means of a dotted line marked <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A. The other half of the fastener, designated <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>B, is attached to a sock <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which, in turn, is engaged with the blade <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A second zip fastener has components or halves <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B respectively which are attached to the second edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and to a sock <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which is engaged with the blade <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In an inset drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) the reference numeral <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> denotes a sock which is representative of the socks <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The sock <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is made from flexible sheet material which is shaped into a tubular form. One portion of the tubular form is shaped into a closed pocket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which is sealed at an outer end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the remainder of the tubular form, designated <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, has sections marked <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B respectively of a zip fastener <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, fixed to it. By closing the zip <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> the entire sock is formed into a continuous tubular shape. On the other hand when the zip fastener <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is opened the zip sections <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B are detached from one another and the tubular sock opened over the length <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for, as noted, the pocket <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is a closed pocket with access to the pocket being provided only from the right hand end of the sock as is indicated by means of an arrow marked <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. It should be borne in mind, in this regard, that the end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be made from any suitable material according to requirement. For example the panel may be made from shade netting or similar material to provide primary protection against the sun. Lightweight nylon or a similar continuous sheet material can be used to provide protection from the sun and against rain. The panel could be made from infrared signature suppression material to protect the helicopter from detection when on the ground with hot engines, or if other dynamic components of the helicopter generate heat. The sheet material could also be a camouflaged material to protect the helicopter from visual detection when on the ground. Generally these aspects are known in the art and consequently are not further described herein. It is to be noted that the invention is not limited in this regard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> If the protection system is to be installed then, for the given example, one, two, three or four panels may be engaged with respective pairs of rotor blades. Initially a sock is slid over each respective blade. The respective zip <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is opened to facilitate engagement of the pocket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with the outer tip of the blade. The pocket is threaded over the blade end until the tip of the blade abuts the end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> inside the pocket. The zip fastener <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is then closed so that the sock closely envelops the blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is attached to the sock <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by means of the zip fastener <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which ties the zip sections <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>B together thereby securing the panel along the first edge <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the sock <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. A similar technique is adopted to secure the second edge of the panel to the sock <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The process can be repeated to secure additional panels, not shown, between the blades <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, between the blades <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and between the blades <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the helicopter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with panels <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>D respectively secured to and between the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> respectively. Each panel has a respective safety shear strip <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>D. The shear strip is designed, as has been indicated, to part the panel into its respective sections if a predetermined force is exerted on the panel. For example the panel will part in strong winds to prevent damage to the blades or the helicopter control system if the aircraft is not moored and the blades are not picketed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The protection system is made from lightweight flexible material which, when detached from the blades, can be compactly stowed for storage and transport purposes. The individual panels and socks are readily disassembled merely by opening the relevant zip fasteners. It is not necessary under all conditions to make use of the four panels for one or more panels can be attached to the respective blades according to the amount of protection which is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The degree of shade which is afforded by the protection system is substantial, depending on the material from which the panels are made, and reduces the temperature inside the cockpit of the aircraft by a considerable amount. The cockpit equipment is also protected against sun ultraviolet damage and the temperature decrease in the avionics bays is expected to prolong the life of the electronic equipment. </paragraph>
