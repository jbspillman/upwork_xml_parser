<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an image forming method and an image forming apparatus each for use in a copier, a facsimile, a printer, or the like. In particular, it relates to image formation performed by controlling a developer jumping from a developer holding member to a rear electrode by means of a printhead controlled by an image signal and causing the developer to adhere to an image receiving member positioned between the printhead and the rear electrode. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> With recent improvements in the performance of personal computers and recent advances in networking technology, there have been growing demands for printers with high processing abilities which can handle not only voluminous documents but also color documents. However, an image forming apparatus capable of outputting monochrome and color documents of sufficiently high quality and having a high processing speed is still under development, the advent of which has been expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As one of technologies which implement such a high-performance image forming apparatus, there has conventionally been known an image forming technology which causes a toner to jump onto a recording sheet or image-forming means such as an intermediate image holding belt under the effect of an electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As examples of an image forming apparatus of this type, there have been known image forming apparatus disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. SHO 44-26333, U.S. Pat. No. 3,689,935 (Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. SHO 60-20747), Japanese Domestic-Phase PCT Patent Application No. HEI 9-500842, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> description will be given to an image forming apparatus proposed in the specification and drawings of Japanese Patent Application No. HEI 10-100780 as an example of a similar image forming apparatus. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, 31</cross-reference> denotes a grounded toner holding member for holding and transporting a charged toner, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> denotes a regulating blade for controlling the toner in one to three layers on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> denotes a supply roller for charging and supplying the toner to the toner holding member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> denotes a printhead formed with a toner passage hole <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. A control electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed around the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. A voltage corresponding to an image signal is applied from a control power supply <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, such as a driving IC, to the control electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> denotes a rear electrode, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> denotes a power supply for the rear electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> denotes receiving means such as a recording sheet transported on the rear electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the arrangement, the supply roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the toner holding member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are operated such that a uniform toner layer is formed on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by means of the regulating blade <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and transported. Under these conditions, a voltage is applied to the rear electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a voltage corresponding to the image signal is applied from the control power supply <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to the control electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in synchronization with the movement of the image receiving means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> while it is moved. Consequently, the toner on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> passes through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in response to the image signal to jump onto the image receiving means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and form a required image thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To form a fine image at, e.g., 600 dpi (a density of 600 dots per inch) on the entire surface of the image receiving means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a plurality of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> should be formed in the printhead <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Even if the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are arranged in a row, a fine image as mentioned above cannot be formed so that the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the control electrodes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are arranged in a plurality of rows (e.g., eight rows in an example shown in the drawing), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the control electrodes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have, e.g., circular configurations. Connecting electrodes electrically connecting to each of the control electrodes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are provided on both sides of the toner holding member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to extend along the moving direction thereof for the prevention of mutual interference therebetween. Each of the connecting electrodes is connected to the lead of the control power supply <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for outputting a control voltage, such as a driving IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Although the image receiving means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is composed of a recording sheet or the like such that an image is formed directly thereon in the exemplary structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the recording sheet or the like is disadvantageous in that the thickness thereof easily varies, the properties thereof easily change due to humidity, and it is prone to deformation during movement. In the case of color printing, it is difficult to synchronize the timings for image formations in different colors due to inconsistent transportation of the recording sheet so that image quality is likely to be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To prevent this, there are cases where an intermediate image holding belt is used preferably as the image receiving means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that images formed on the image holding belt are transferred simultaneously onto a recording sheet or the like, as shown in the specification and drawings of, e.g., Japanese Patent Application No. HEI 10-100780. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> description will be given to a structure using the image holding belt. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, 43</cross-reference> denotes an endless image holding belt as the image receiving means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is composed of a resin film having conductive fillers dispersed therein and a resistivity of 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;cm. The image holding belt <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is wound around a pair of rollers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> denotes a pickup roller for feeding out recording sheets <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on a one-by-one basis from a sheet feed tray <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> denotes a timing roller for providing synchronism between the fed recording sheet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the position of an image. <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> denotes a transfer roller for transferring a toner image formed on the image holding belt <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> onto the recording sheet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The transfer roller <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is pressed toward the roller <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the image holding belt <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween, while a transfer voltage is applied thereto. <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> denotes a fixing unit for fixing the toner image to the recording sheet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by heating and pressing the recording sheet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> having the toner image transferred thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, the foregoing image forming apparatus has the problem of so-called clogging. As the apparatus is used for a longer period, toner particles gradually clog the toner passage holes (printhead openings) and hamper precise recording. As a method for preventing clogging, there has been known one which cleans the openings of the printhead by ejecting the toner from the toner holding member (toner supplying member) through the printhead openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Specifically, there have been proposed a method of applying an ultrasonic wave to the printhead, a method of applying a voltage to an electrode provided on the printhead, a method of forcibly pressing the toner supplying member onto the printhead, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, if the toner ejected for cleaning in accordance with the foregoing conventional methods is large in amount, the toner deposited on the rear electrode reaches the printhead to enter the printhead openings. If the toner is further ejected under this condition, the deposited toner presses the toner in the printhead openings so that the toner solidifies in the printhead openings. This leads to the problem that clogging is caused by the toner ejected for cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Clogging resulting from the deposition of the ejected toner presents a serious problem not only in the cleaning step but also on other occasions. For example, clogging as described above occurs when a driving system for the rear electrode is out of order or when a driving roller for the intermediate transfer belt skids and the intermediate transfer belt rotates free. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> If the toner is ejected in the clogging state, the toner solidifies in the openings, which resultingly damages the printhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> There is still another problem that, if the toner is deposited on the opposing member during ejection, so-called in-apparatus contamination is likely to occur. On collision with the toner on the opposing member, the ejected toner is scattered to a periphery to contaminate the inside of the apparatus, thereby causing the in-apparatus contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> If a large mount of toner is deposited on the opposing member, the toner adheres to the printhead due to electrostatic repulsion between toner particles. As a result, an electric field is distorted by the charge of the toner adhered to the head so that the direction of the jumping toner is distorted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been achieved in view of the foregoing and it is therefore a primary object of the present invention to keep the developer deposited on the opposing member from contact with the printhead and prevent the clogging of the printhead openings. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To attain the object, the present invention provides a method for forming an image, the method comprising: an opposing member moving step of moving an opposing member disposed in opposing relation to a developer supplying member for supplying a developer with a printhead interposed therebetween; and an ejecting step of ejecting the developer from the developer supplying member toward the opposing member through openings of the printhead, the ejecting step being initiated after the opposing member moving step is initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> By allowing the opposing member to move, the arrangement prevents the developer from being deposited at a localized point on the opposing member, thereby keeping the developer on the opposing member from contact with the printhead and preventing the clogging of the openings. In addition, the probability of collision between developers on the opposing member is also reduced so that in-apparatus contamination due to the jumping of a toner is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The method can further comprise: a detecting step of detecting a moving state of the opposing member, wherein the initiation of the ejecting step is controlled based on a result of the detection obtained in the detecting step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The method comprises: an opposing member moving step of moving an opposing member disposed in opposing relation to a developer supplying member for supplying a developer with a printhead interposed therebetween; and a cleaning step of ejecting the developer from the developer supplying member toward the opposing member through openings of the printhead and thereby cleaning the openings of the printhead, the cleaning step being initiated after the opposing member moving step is initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> By allowing the opposing member to move, the arrangement prevents the developer ejected during the cleaning of the openings from being deposited at a localized point on the opposing member, thereby keeping the developer on the opposing member from contact with the printhead and preventing the clogging of the openings. The foregoing effect is particularly significant in the cleaning step in which the developer is ejected in large amount per unit time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A moving speed of the opposing member is adjusted to be higher in the cleaning step for the printhead than in an image forming step of forming a toner image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The arrangement reduces the amount of deposited toner per unit area on the opposing member in the cleaning step for the printhead. As a result, the printhead can be cleaned by ejecting the toner in large amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the image forming method, a plurality of printheads are arranged in a direction of movement of the opposing member and, of impact positions of developers ejected through each of the openings of the printheads and impacted on the opposing member in the cleaning step, at least one may be different from the others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the arrangement, the impact positions of the developers from the plurality of printheads are dispersed. This keeps the toners from contact with the printheads and prevents clogging due to local increases in the amounts of deposited toners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The plurality of printheads correspond to the developers in a plurality of colors and, of the impact positions of the developers impacted on the opposing member in the cleaning step, the one in the palest color may be positioned closer to an image formation region on the opposing member than the impact positions of the developers in the other colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If the developers are ejected in accordance with, e.g., an ultrasonic method or a printhead contact method, the developers impacted on the opposing member are scattered to the peripheries of the impact positions. If the scattered developers enter the image formation region on the opposing member on which a recording member is disposed, the upper and lower end portions of the recording member is contaminated by the scattered developers. If the palest one of the developers in the plurality of colors, such as yellow, is deposited at the position closest to the image formation region, however, contamination becomes inconspicuous even if the developers enter the image formation region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The impact position of the developer in the palest color can be positioned closer to a tip of the image formation region in a direction in which the opposing member is moved than the impact positions of the developers in the other colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the arrangement, part of the scattered developers float in the space between the printheads and the opposing member to be impacted again on the opposing member so that the tip of the image formation region in the direction of movement is most likely to suffer contamination. By causing the palest one, such as yellow, of the developers to be impacted on the tip portion of the image formation region in the direction of movement, contamination on the tip portion of the image formation region in the direction of movement becomes inconspicuous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> An intensity of an electric field between the printhead and the opposing member can be adjusted to be lower in the cleaning step than in an image forming step of forming an image by ejecting the developer onto the opposing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Even if an electrostatic field formed between the printheads and the opposing member divides the developers into those of a positive polarity and those of a negative polarity, the arrangement prevents the developers of one of the positive and negative polarities from adhering to the surfaces of the printheads and allows the developers of each of the positive and negative polarities to reach the opposing member by using the electric field formed between the printhead and the opposing member. Accordingly, the efficiency with which the developers are reclaimed can be increased irrespective of the polarities of the developers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The method can further comprise: a developer supplying step of supplying the developer from the developer supplying member to a vicinity of each of the openings of the printhead, wherein the cleaning step is initiated prior to the developer supplying step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The arrangement prevents the ejection of the developer in large amount resulting from the cleaning step performed with a continuous supply of the developer and reduces the amount of the ejected developer by halting the supply of the developer in the cleaning step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The method may further comprise: an electric field forming step of forming a specified electric field between a group of electrodes around the openings of the printhead and the developer supplying member, wherein the electric field forming step is initiated before the cleaning step is initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> By forming the electric field for suppressing the supply of the developer from the developer supplying member, the arrangement reduces the amount of the ejected developer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides an apparatus for forming an image, the apparatus comprising: a developer supplying member for supplying a developer; an opposing member disposed in opposing relation to the developer supplying member; and a printhead disposed between the developer supplying member and the opposing member and having openings for allowing the developer on the developer supplying member to pass therethrough toward the opposing member based on an image signal from the outside, the opposing member initiates movement before the developer on the developer supplying member is ejected through the openings of the printhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> By allowing the opposing member to move, the arrangement prevents the developer from being deposited at a localized point on the opposing member, thereby keeping the developer on the opposing member from contact with the printhead and preventing the clogging of the openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The apparatus may further comprise: detecting means for detecting the movement of the opposing member; and ejection initiation control means for controlling initiation of the ejection of the developer from the developer supplying means if the movement of the opposing member is detected by the detecting means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> There is also provided an apparatus for forming an image, the apparatus comprising: a developer supplying member for supplying a developer; an opposing member disposed in opposing relation to the developer supplying member; and a printhead disposed between the developer supplying member and the opposing member and having openings for allowing a developer on the developer supplying member to pass therethrough toward the opposing member based on an image signal from the outside, the developer on the developer supplying member being ejected through the openings of the printhead to clean the openings after the opposing member initiates movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> By allowing the opposing member to move, the arrangement prevents the developer ejected during the cleaning of the openings from being deposited at a localized point on the opposing member, thereby keeping the developer on the opposing member from contact with the printhead and preventing the clogging of the openings. The foregoing effect is particularly significant in the cleaning state in which the developer is ejected in large amount per unit time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A moving speed of the opposing member can be adjusted to be higher when the openings are cleaned by ejecting the developer on the developer supplying means through the openings of the printhead than when a toner image is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The arrangement reduces the amount of deposited toner per unit area on the opposing member during the cleaning of the printhead. As a result, the printhead can be cleaned by ejecting the toner in large amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the image forming apparatus, a plurality of printheads are arranged in a direction of movement of the opposing member and, of impact positions of developers ejected through each of the openings of the printheads and impacted on the opposing member during a cleaning period for each of the printheads, at least one may be different from the others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the arrangement, the impact positions of the developers from the plurality of printheads are dispersed. This keeps the toners from contact with the printheads and prevents clogging due to local increases in the amounts of deposited toners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The plurality of printheads correspond to the developers in a plurality of colors and, of the impact positions of the developers impacted on the opposing member during the cleaning period for each of the printheads, the one of the palest color can be positioned closer to an image formation region on the opposing member than the impact positions of the developers in the other colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> If the developers are ejected in accordance with, e.g., an ultrasonic method or a printhead contact method, the developers impacted on the opposing member are scattered to the peripheries of the impact positions. If the scattered developers enter the image formation region on the opposing member on which a recording member is disposed, the upper and lower end portions of the recording member is contaminated by the scattered developers. By depositing the palest one of the developers in the plurality of colors, such as yellow, at the position closest to the image formation region, as described above, the present invention can render contamination inconspicuous even if the developers enter the image formation region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the image forming apparatus, the impact position of the developer in the palest color may be positioned closer to a tip of the image formation region on the opposing member in the direction of movement of the opposing member than the impact positions of the developers in the other colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the arrangement, part of the scattered developers float in the space between the printheads and the opposing member to be impacted again on the opposing member so that the tip of the image formation region in the direction of movement of the opposing member is most likely to suffer contamination. By causing the palest one of the developers, such as yellow, to be impacted on the tip portion of the image formation region, contamination on the tip portion of the image formation region becomes inconspicuous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the image forming apparatus, an intensity of an electric field between the printhead and the opposing member can be adjusted to be lower during the cleaning period than during image formation during which an image is formed by ejecting the developer onto the opposing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Even if an electrostatic field formed between the printheads and the opposing member divides the developers into those of a positive polarity and those of a negative polarity, the arrangement prevents the developers of one of the positive and negative polarities from adhering to the surfaces of the printheads and allows the developers of each of the positive and negative polarities to reach the opposing member by using the electric field formed between the printhead and the opposing member. Accordingly, the efficiency with which the developers are reclaimed can be increased irrespective of the polarities of the developers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The cleaning of the openings of the printhead is initiated before the developer is supplied from the developer supplying member to a vicinity of each of the openings of the printhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The arrangement prevents the ejection of the developer in large amount resulting from the cleaning step performed with a continuous supply of the developer and reduces the amount of the ejected developer by halting the supply of the developer in the cleaning step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A group of electrodes are provided around the openings of the printhead and a specified electric field is formed between the group of electrodes and the developer supplying member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> By forming the electric field for suppressing the supply of the developer from the developer supplying member, the arrangement reduces the amount of the ejected developer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The developer that can be used in the present invention is not limited to a dry toner. Other developers including a liquid ink having a pigment or dye dispersed in a fluid dispersion and a wet toner having toner particles dispersed in a fluid dispersion may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> If the liquid ink is used, the developer ejected toward the opposing member such as an intermediate transfer belt or a rear electrode is not deposited as a toner so that the clogging of the openings by the developer deposited on the opposing member does not occur. However, if the liquid ink is impacted in large amount on the same impact position, the opposing member swells or the mechanical strength thereof is reduced significantly due to the penetration of the liquid ink into the opposing member. This causes the problems of a shorter lifetime of the opposing member, degraded registration of a color image due to a change in the size of the opposing member, and a damaged peripheral member such as a damaged printhead due to the deformation of the opposing member. However, the present invention can reduce the foregoing problems since the impact positions of the liquid ink are dispersed. If the liquid ink is impacted on a hard opposing member, the phenomenon of the ink scattered to the periphery of the opposing member may also occur, similarly to the dry toner. Hence, the present invention is effective in either case in solving the problems caused by the phenomenon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> If the wet toner is used, the fluid dispersion reaches the opposing member together with the toner particles. This causes two problems, of which one is associated with the deposition of the toner on the opposing member also observed when the dry toner is used and the other is associated with the penetration of the fluid dispersion into the opposing member also observed when the liquid ink is used. By practicing the present invention, therefore, these problems can be solved.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, the best modes for carrying out the present invention will be described as individual embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view schematically showing a structure of an image forming apparatus according to EMBODIMENT 1 of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, 1</cross-reference> denotes a toner and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a toner holding member for holding and transporting the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is composed of a cylindrical body made of aluminum and having an outer diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 1 mm. The toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a grounded configuration. The toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may also be made of materials other than aluminum including a metal such as iron, an alloy, or a member composed of a rubber material such as a silicon rubber or an urethane rubber wound around a core shaft. Besides a roller-shaped configuration, a belt-like or drum-like configuration may also be used. Instead of grounding the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a dc voltage or an ac voltage may also be applied. In the case of applying an ac voltage, a dc voltage may be superimposed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed in a layer on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by means of a regulating blade (not shown). The regulating blade is formed of an elastic member made of urethane, silicon, or the like and has a hardness of 40 to 80 degree (JIS K6301 A Scale) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The length of the free end of the regulating blade (the length of the portion of the regulating blade extending off a mounting member) for regulating the toner layer on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 5 to 15 nm. A proper linear pressure exerted by the regulating blade on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 5 to 40 g/cm. Under the pressure exerted by the regulating blade, a toner is formed into one to three layers on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The regulating blade is used in an electrically floating or grounded state or with the a dc or ac voltage applied thereto. In the present embodiment, the regulating blade is used in the floating state. The toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the regulating blade and slightly stirred to receive charge from the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied by a supply roller (not shown) to a surface of the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The supply roller is composed of an expandable synthetic rubber such as urethane formed to a thickness of about 2 to 6 mm on a shaft (with a diameter of 8 mm in the present embodiment) made of metal such as iron. The hardness of a surface of the supply roller is 30 degrees (measured by a method according to JIS K6301 A Scale). The amount of interlocking between the supply roller and the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 2 mm. The supply roller is used in a grounded state or with a dc or ac voltage applied thereto. The supply roller controls the amount of toner supplied to the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and also aids the charging of the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The polarity of the charged toner may be either positive or negative. In the present embodiment, the negatively charged toner is used. Preferably, the type and amount of a charge control agent added to the toner are adjusted such that an amount of toner charge q/m is &minus;5 to &minus;30 &mgr;C/g. If the absolute value of the amount of toner charge is smaller than the foregoing range, the toner of the opposite polarity increases so that the toner adheres to the periphery of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This causes the clogging of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or distorts a deflection electric field, thereby preventing the toner from being deflected in a normal direction. If the absolute value of the amount of toner charge is larger than the foregoing range, an image force is enhanced between the toner particles and the toner holding member and the toner particles cannot be desorbed from the toner holding member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> denotes a rear electrode. Although the present embodiment has composed of the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a metal plate, a resin film having conductive fillers dispersed therein may also be used. In this case, the resistance of the film is preferably on the order of 10<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>12 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;cm. A toner image may also be formed and recorded by causing the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to adhere directly onto the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or by placing the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and causing the toner to adhere onto the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. It is also possible to process the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into an endless film configuration, recording the toner directly onto the film, and then transferring the toner image onto the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The distance between the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which will be described later, is preferably in the range of 50 to 1000 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> denotes a voltage source for rear electrode which supplies a constant voltage to the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The voltage applied to the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is preferably &plus;500 V to &plus;2000 V and more preferably &plus;800 V to &plus;1500 V. If the voltage applied to the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is higher than the foregoing range, an electrical short circuit may occur between the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to cause a discharge breakdown therebetween. If the applied voltage is lower than the foregoing range, on the other hand, a force electrostatically attracting the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> toward the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is reduced and the toner sufficient to print dots at a high density cannot be attracted toward the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> denotes a printhead and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> denotes an insulating base material composing the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The insulating base material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a thickness ranging properly from 10 to 100 &mgr;m and is preferably composed of a material such as polyimide or polyethylene terephthalate. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> denotes an insulating protective layer covering the surfaces of a control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>which will be described later. The insulating protective layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a thickness ranging properly from 5 to 30 &mgr;m. It will be appreciated that the material and thickness of each of the insulating base material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the insulating protective layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the number of constituent layers thereof, and the like are not limited thereto. The insulating base material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the insulating protective layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be designed arbitrarily provided that it has a structure according to the embodiments of the present invention that will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> denotes a toner passage hole extending through the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The formation of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is performed preferably by a punching process using an exciter laser, a YAG laser, a CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser, or the like, followed by en etching process for forming electrodes. The toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> arranged lengthwise of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to form a row of toner passage holes. The printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> described in the present embodiment has two rows of toner passage holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> denotes a control electrode formed on the surface portion of the base material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> closer to the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to surround the periphery of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>denote deflection electrodes provided on the surface portions of the base material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> closer to the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to surround the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Each of the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is composed of a copper or aluminum foil having a thickness on the order of 2 to 30 &mgr;m. The configuration of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> denotes a voltage source for control electrode which is connected to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to supply a voltage pulse to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in response to an image signal supplied from the outside. The voltage source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for control electrode is composed of a voltage generator (not shown) for generating a voltage and switching elements (not shown) for switching the voltage. Each of the switching elements has about 32, 64, or 128 channels and controls the voltage supplied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. For example, if recording is performed at a recording density (300 dpi) of 300 dots per inch and if switching elements each having 64 channels are used, five switching elements each having 64 channels are required to control 300 openings. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are voltage sources for deflection electrodes which are connected to the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>respectively. The voltage sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for deflection electrodes supply voltages to the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in synchronization with a voltage pulse supplied from the voltage source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for control electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A description will be given next to the respective structures of the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>each provided on the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG.2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are plan views showing the electrodes provided on the surface of the printhead <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provided therein, of which <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> provided on the side of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> closer to the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provided therein and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> provided on the side of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> closer to the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The diameter of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is set to about 50 to 200 &mgr;m. The control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is configured as a circle concentric to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and having an inner diameter larger than the diameter of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by about 5 to 30 &mgr;m. The width of the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which can be obtained as the difference between the outer and inner diameters of the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, is adjusted to about 5 to 30 &mgr;m. Although each of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) has a circular configuration, it may have an elliptic or oval configuration. The control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> need not surround the entire circumference of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may also be provided upstream or downstream of the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the direction of rotation thereof. </paragraph>

In an exemplary case as shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the jumping toners form the three tracks of left, center, and right ones so that N&equals;3 is satisfied. In the present embodiment, the toners form the three tracks, similarly to the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), so that &thgr;&equals;18.3 degrees is satisfied. The deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are used commonly by the adjacent toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> An antistatic electrode may also be provided on the outermost surface of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This prevents the toner particles from charging the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in contact therewith. In addition, the amount of toner charge on the toner holding member becomes constant. A hard material such as conductive amorphous carbon is used preferably to compose the antistatic electrode for the suppression of friction resulting from direct contact between the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the toner particles. The surface resistance of the antistatic electrode is preferably in the range of <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;/&square; to 10<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;/&square;. If the surface resistance is over the range, the effect of removing the charge is degraded. If the surface resistance is under the range, on the other hand, an electrical short circuit may occur between the antistatic electrode and the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A description will be given first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). By applying different voltages from the deflection power sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provided on the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an electric field centering around the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> loses symmetry so that the track of the jumping toner that has passed through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is deflected from the center of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is impacted on a position at a distance from the center axis of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to form a dot. By applying the same voltages to the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is impacted on the center axis of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> By thus controlling the deflection voltages applied to the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>dots can be formed at a plurality of positions on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the single toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This allows a high-resolution toner image to be formed on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> even if the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provided in the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is small in number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The left-hand portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) shows the case where the voltage (VH) applied to the deflection electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>positioned on the left side of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> relative to a direction orthogonal to the direction of transportation of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is higher than the voltage (VL) applied to the deflection electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>positioned on the right side of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, the track of jumping of the negatively charged toner <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is deflected leftward by an electrostatic field formed between the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(hereinafter, the electric field formed between the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will be referred to as a deflection electric field). The middle portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) shows the case where the same voltages (VM) are applied to the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This causes the charged toner to move straight toward the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to reach a position on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> opposed to the position of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The right-hand portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) shows the case where the voltage (VH) applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is higher than the voltage (VL) applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As a result, a deflection electric field oriented reversely to that shown in the left-hand portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) is formed between the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the track of jumping of the negatively charged toner <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is deflected rightward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The foregoing steps of deflecting the track of the jumping toner, i.e., the step of leftward deflection (hereinafter referred to as a leftward deflection step), the step of straight movement (hereinafter referred to as a straight movement step), and the step of rightward deflection (hereinafter referred to as a rightward deflection step) are repeated continuously with the transportation of the receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so that a toner image is formed on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The period during which the leftward deflection step, the straight movement step, and the rightward deflection step are repeated will be referred to as an entire deflection step period. The distance between two dots formed on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the leftward deflection step and in the straight movement step will be referred to as a leftward deflection distance and the distance between two dots formed on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the rightward deflection step and in the straight movement step will be referred to as a rightward deflection distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the period Tt shows a time required to form one line, which corresponds to the entire deflection step period. The period Tt is determined by a resolution in the direction of transportation of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. If a lateral line with a pitch of, e.g., 300 dpi (dot/inch) is to be formed, a line pitch of about 84.6 &mgr;m is obtained by dividing 1 inch&equals;25.4 mm by 300 dots. The image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> moves appropriately by one pitch during the formation of one line. If the speed of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is assumed to be, e.g., 60 mm/s, the period Tt becomes about 1390 &mgr;s. In the present embodiment, the resolution is set to 600 dpi and the speed of transportation of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is set to 100 mm/s. Accordingly, the Tt period becomes 423 &mgr;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> TL, TC, TR denote control voltage supply times required to control the formation of one dot by supplying voltages to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, of which TL is a control voltage supply time required to form one dot by the leftward deflection step and TC and TR are respective control voltage supply times for forming one dot by the straight movement step and the rightward deflection step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the control voltage supply times are set to satisfy TL&equals;TC&equals;TR. Since Tt&equals;423 &mgr;s is satisfied, TL&equals;TC&equals;TR&equals;141 &mgr;s is satisfied. Each of the control voltage supply times TL, TC, and TR is composed of a pulse voltage width Tb or promoting the passage of the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a suppression period Tw for suppressing the passage of the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The pulse voltage width Tb is variable in responsive to the image signal supplied from the outside. Specifically, Tb is adjusted to be short when dots at a low density are formed. When dots at a high density are formed, Tb is adjusted to be long. If the pulse voltage width Tb is adjusted to zero, the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> cannot pass through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so that a non-printed region is formed. This allows the formation of an image excellent in halftone property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Tw is supplied during a period between the termination of Tb and the subsequent control voltage supply time. In the present embodiment, the variable range of Tb is set to 0 &mgr;s to 80 &mgr;s. The voltage Vw applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> during the suppression period Tw is adjusted to &minus;50 V and the pulse width Vc is adjusted to 300 V. The voltage level Vw applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> during the suppression period Tw and the voltage Vc superimposed on the voltage level Vw during the period Tb are not limited to the foregoing values provided that an electric field suppressing or promoting the passage of the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed between the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Although the present embodiment has applied the suppression voltage Vw to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> during the suppression period Tw, the passage of the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can also be suppressed during the period Tw if Vw is set to the ground level of the image forming apparatus and a voltage of the polarity opposite to that of the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is applied to the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The control voltage applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a timing chart showing the waveform of an image voltage applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a timing chart showing the waveform of a reference voltage also applied to the control voltage <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the pulse voltage Vc of the image voltage is set to 300 V and the variable range of the pulse voltage width Tb is set to 0 &mgr;s to 80 &mgr;s. If an image is recorded in response to an image signal, the pulse voltage Vc is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Conversely, if an image is not recorded, the pulse voltage Vc is not applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the voltage level Vw of &minus;50 V is applied as the reference voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> during the suppression period Tw. The pulse voltage Vk of the reference voltage is set to 150 V, while the pulse voltage width is adjusted larger than zero and smaller than the pulse voltage width Tb of the image voltage. Such a pulse voltage Vk is applied periodically to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> during each control voltage supply time TL (&equals;TC, TR). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The waveform of the control voltage is formed by combining the waveform of the image voltage with the waveform of the reference voltage. The timing chart for the control voltage is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). By thus forming the pulse voltage Vk, the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can easily be ejected from the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> If a toner having the property of being easily desorbed from the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is used, the pulse voltage Vk is preferably minimized and Vk is preferably 0 V or lower. This is because, even if the pulse voltage Vc is not applied, the toner may be desorbed from the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> due to the pulse voltage Vk to adhere to the periphery of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or jump toward the opposing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the voltage sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for deflection electrodes which supply respective deflection voltages to the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are capable of outputting the three voltage levels VL, VM, and VH and switch among the deflection voltage levels in synchronization with the control voltage supply time required to form one dot. By way of example, the present embodiment assumes that VL&equals;&minus;50 V, VM&equals;&plus;50 V, VH&equals;&plus;150 V are satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A description will be given to the outline of an image forming operation performed by the image forming apparatus with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. First, the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rotates and the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transported to a position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A voltage of &plus;1000 V is applied preliminarily from the voltage source <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for rear electrode to the real electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, while a voltage of &minus;50 V is applied simultaneously to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The voltage supplied from the voltage source <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for rear electrode blocks an electrostatic field formed between the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> remains held on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Then, the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transported to a position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, i.e., a position at which printing is executed. At the same time as the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transported to the printing execution position, a specified pulse voltage as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is supplied selectively from the voltage source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for control electrode to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. As a result, an adsorption electric field which adsorbs the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> toward the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> supplied with the pulse voltage is formed between the toner holding member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> desorbed from the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the adsorption electric field is further adsorbed by an electric field formed between the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to enter the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In synchronization with the pulse voltage applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, specified voltages are applied from the voltage sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for deflection electrodes to the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, whereby the track of the jumping toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that has passed through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is deflected by a deflection electric field distorted in the vicinity of the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. After the track of jumping is deflected, the toner is electrostatically adsorbed by the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be impacted on the moving image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and form a dot. The image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed with the dot is transported to fixing means not shown so that the toner on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is heat-fused by the fixing means to be fixed onto the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. After the fixing step is completed, the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is discharged from the image forming apparatus to the outside and a toner image fixed to the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is finally obtained. </paragraph>

The belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may also have another structure for detecting the rotation of the belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The present image forming apparatus has a controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for controlling the voltage applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> based on a detection signal from the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and thereby controlling the initiation of the ejection of the toner from each of the toner holding members <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A description will be given to an image forming operation performed by the image forming apparatus according to EMBODIMENT 1 of the present invention by using the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</cross-reference>. First, in Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, image signals from the outside are accumulated in the image forming apparatus. After the accumulation of the image signals is completed, the whole step moves to Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, inputting to the sensor is initiated by projecting light from the light projector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Then, the rotative driving of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the belt driving roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the fixing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is initiated and the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotating normally. The determination is performed based on the result of detection performed by the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. If the through hole <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is not present in the space between the light projector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the light receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the light from the light projector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is cut off by the belt edge portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that the light is not received by the light receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>light. If the through hole <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>passes through the space between the light projector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the light receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>the light from the light projector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is received by the light receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>so that the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> outputs a signal. If the signal is outputted in a given cycle, it is determined that the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotating normally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> If it is determined in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is not rotating normally, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> where the belt driving roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the fixing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are halted. Then, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> where the image forming apparatus displays an error and is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> If it is determined in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotating normally, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> where the aforesaid reference voltage composing the control voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This forms a specified electric field between the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> around the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of each of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the corresponding toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Next, in Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, voltages lower than the rear voltages applied to the rear electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Y, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>M, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>BK during image formation are applied thereto to form an electric field lower in intensity than the electric field formed during image formation between the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and thereby reclaim the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reliably. It is also possible to reduce the intensity of the electric field and produce a specific state in which the intensity of the electric field is zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> With the electric field being formed, head cleaning for cleaning the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by ejecting the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the toner holding members <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is performed. Specifically, the controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> applies the pulse voltage for cleaning the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the control electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> upon receiving a detection signal from the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and causes the toner adhered to the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be ejected therefrom. At this time, the impact position of the yellow toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>Y which is the palest one of the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>Y, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>M, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>BK in the different colors of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black ejected through the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is positioned closer to a tip portion of an image formation region on the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the direction of movement (the direction indicated by the arrow B in the drawing) of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> than the impact positions of the other magenta, cyan, and black toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>M, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>BK. After the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are cleaned, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the supply of the toners to the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is initiated by initiating the rotation of the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and then the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In Step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the rear voltages for image formation are supplied to the rear electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for different colors. On the other hand, the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transported from a sheet feed cassette not shown to the resist roller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to move onto the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with a specified timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Then, when the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transported to a position opposing the toner supplying unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y in Step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> initiates, based on a detection signal from the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the application of the image voltage corresponding to the image signal from the outside to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided in the unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y. Responsively, the toner on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y passes through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provided in the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to reach the surface of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> held on the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> moves consistently thereon and the specified voltage is supplied sequentially to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, whereby a toner image is formed by the yellow toner on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> When the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transported to the position opposing the toner supplying unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M, the same process performed in the unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y is performed so that a magenta toner image is superimposed on the yellow toner image on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The same process is also performed in the toner supplying units <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>BK so that color toner images in four colors are formed eventually on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> holding the color toner images is separated from the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to enter the fixing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In the fixing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the color toner images are fixed onto the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so that the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is discharged therefrom into a sheet discharge tray not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> By the foregoing process, a color image is printed on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In the toner supplying units <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>BK for different colors through which the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has passed, the application of the image voltages is stopped successively in Step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. After that, the supply of the voltages to the rear electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also stopped in Step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Then, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> where the rotative driving of the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is stopped and then moves to Step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, head cleaning similar to that performed in Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is performed again with respect to each of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Then, in Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the supply of low voltages that have been applied to the rear electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is stopped, whereby the electric field between the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is extinguished. Then, in Step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the application of the reference voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of each of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is halted. As a result, the electric field formed between the control electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is extinguished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> from which the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was separated is cleaned by the belt cleaning unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> adhered to the surface of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is removed from the surface of the belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> When the surface of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> opposed to the toner supplying units for different colors passes through at least the cleaning unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the rotation of the belt driving roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is stopped and the rotative driving of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is stopped. The driving of the fixing unit is also stopped, whereby the printing operation performed by the image forming apparatus according to EMBODIMENT 1 of the present invention is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The image forming operation performed by the image forming apparatus will further be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and the timing chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. First, the driving of the belt driving roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is initiated by projecting light from the light projector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> toward the light receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>After that, if the light receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> detects the light from the light projector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the reference voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Then, cleaning is performed first by ejecting the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the yellow toner supplying unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> After the cleaning of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is completed, the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the toner supplying unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y is driven. After the driving of the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the rear voltage is supplied to the rear electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Y. Thereafter, the image voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> so that an image is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The magenta printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is cleaned after a lapse of a specified time from the completion of the cleaning of the yellow printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the same printing operation as the yellow printing operation is also performed continuously in the magenta toner supplying unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M concurrently with the yellow printing operation. Likewise, cyan and black printing operations are performed concurrently with the yellow printing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the present embodiment, the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is ejected to the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through each of the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to clean the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> before the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied to the vicinity of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by rotatively driving the corresponding toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Prior to the cleaning of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, an electric field is formed between the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> around the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Prior to the formation of the electric field between the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the movement of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Since the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is allowed to move, the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> ejected during the cleaning of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is prevented from being deposited at a localized point on the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. This keeps the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> from contact with the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and prevents the clogging of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Since the impact positions of the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the plurality of printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are dispersed, the contact of the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and clogging due to local increases in the amounts of deposited toners can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> If the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are ejected by, e.g., a method of applying an ultrasonic wave or a method of bringing the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> onto the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> impacted on the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are scattered to the peripheries of the impact positions. If the scattered toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> enter the image formation region on the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in which the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is disposed, the upper and lower end portions of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are contaminated by the scattered toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. By causing the palest one, such as yellow, of the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the plurality of colors to be impacted on a position in closest proximity to the while image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, contamination is inconspicuous even if the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> enter the image formation region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Part of the scattered toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> float in the space between the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to be impacted again on the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Of the end portions of the image formation region, therefore, the tip portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image formation region in the direction of movement of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is most likely to suffer contamination. By causing the palest one, such as yellow, of the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be impacted on the tip portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, contamination at the tip portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> becomes inconspicuous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The electrostatic field formed between the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> divides the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into those of a positive polarity and those of a negative polarity. This prevents the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of one of the positive and negative polarities from adhering to the surface of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and allows the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the positive and negative polarities to reach the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that the efficiency with which the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are reclaimed is increased irrespective of the polarities of the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> By cleaning the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being supplied continuously, the ejection of the toners in large amounts is prevented. By halting the supply of the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the cleaning step, the amounts of the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> By forming the electric field for suppressing the supply of the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the toner supplying members <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the amount of the ejected toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Although the present embodiment has performed the ejection of the toners during the cleaning of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> after the movement of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is initiated, the ejection of the toners is not limited to the period during which the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are cleaned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Although the yellow toner as the palest toner is positioned closer to the tip portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the direction of movement of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> than the toners in the other colors, the yellow toner may also be positioned closer to the proximal portion of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the direction of movement of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or the toners in the other colors may also be positioned closer to the tip portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or the proximal end portion. If the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is not white, the toner in a color close to the color of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is positioned closer to the tip portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The cleaning of each of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may also be initiated after the rotation of the corresponding toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It is also possible to form an electric field between the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after the cleaning of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing embodiment has used a dry toner as a developer, other toners including a wet toner having toner particles dispersed in a fluid dispersion and a liquid ink having a pigment or dye dispersed therein may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Although the present embodiment has applied the reference voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, it is also possible to apply a voltage of the polarity opposite to that of the reference voltage to the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, a voltage outputted from the voltage source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for control electrode is required to have only the positive polarity. This prevents an increase in the size of the voltage source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for control electrode and an intricate process of designing an IC or transistor for switching the voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> between the ON/OFF states. If an antistatic electrode is provided on the outermost surface of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the same effects are achievable by applying the reference voltage to the antistatic electrode instead of applying it to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing embodiment has performed head cleaning between the plurality of image receiving members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, head cleaning need not be performed between each consecutive two of the image receiving members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and may be performed as required. For example, the image forming apparatus may be internally equipped with a counter for counting the number of times that the receiving members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> pass through the positions opposing the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that head cleaning is performed when the number of times reaches a specified value. Head cleaning may also be performed immediately after a power supply for the apparatus is turned ON or during a stand-by period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, EMBODIMENT 2 of the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is different from EMBODIMENT 1 in that, in the printhead cleaning step performed before the image forming step is initiated or after the image forming step is completed when a plurality of sheets are to be printed, larger amounts of toners are ejected even in the image forming step than in the head cleaning step. The present embodiment is also different from EMBODIMENT 1 in that the speed of movement of the opposing member is increased accordingly in the head cleaning step performed before the image forming step is initiated or after the image forming step is completed. As for the components, they are the same as in EMBODIMENT 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> A description will be given herein below to an image forming operation by using the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and the timing chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> First, in Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, image signals from the outside are accumulated in the image forming apparatus. After the accumulation of the image signals is completed, the whole step advances to Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, inputting to the sensor is initiated by projecting light from the light projector <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Then, the rotative driving of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the belt driving roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the fixing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is initiated. The belt driving roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotated such that the moving speed of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> it this time is higher than during an image formation period, which will be described later. Preferably, the ratio of the moving speed of the belt at this time to the moving speed of the belt during the image formation period is determined to be equal to the ratio of the amounts of the ejected toners at this time to the amounts of the ejected toners during the image formation period. Specifically, a ratio of about 1.5 to 2 is preferred. Thereafter, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotating normally. The determining means is the same as in the foregoing embodiment. If it is determined in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is not rotating normally, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> where the belt driving roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the fixing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are halted. Then, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> where the image forming apparatus displays an error and is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> If it is determined in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotating normally, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> where the aforesaid reference voltage composing the control voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This forms a specified electric field between the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> around the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of each of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the corresponding toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the subsequent Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, voltages lower than the rear voltages applied to the rear electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Y, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>M, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>BK during image formation are applied thereto to form an electric field lower in intensity than the electric field formed during image formation between the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and thereby reclaim the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reliably. It is also possible to reduce the intensity of the electric field and produce a specific state in which the intensity of the electric field is zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> With the electric field being formed, head cleaning for cleaning the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by ejecting the toners <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is performed. Specifically, the controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> applies the pulse voltage for cleaning the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the control electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> upon receiving a detection signal from the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and causes the toners in the different colors adhered to the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be ejected simultaneously therefrom. The amounts of the toners ejected at that time are controlled to be larger than those ejected during the image formation period. Specifically, the amounts of the toners ejected at that time are controlled preferably to be about 1.5 to 2 times the amount of the toners ejected during the image formation period. If the ratio is under the range, the function of cleaning the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is degraded if the image forming apparatus is left unused for a long period of time or if environmental conditions change. If the ratio is over the range, the toners are wasted. In addition, the jumped toners and the deposited toners that have reached the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are likely to cause in-apparatus contamination and clogging. The amounts of the ejected toners can be increased easily by elongating the period during which the voltages are applied to the control electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or increasing the voltage levels. If the heads are cleaned by imparting mechanical vibrations to the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the amplitudes of the vibrations of the heads are controlled appropriately to be larger. As described above, the toners in the different colors are preferably ejected simultaneously. This circumvents the deposition of the toners in the different colors in overlapping relation and thereby prevents the problems associated with the toners deposited in large amounts on the transportation belt, including the clogging of the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> After the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are cleaned, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In Step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the supply of the toners to the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is initiated by initiating the rotation of the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and then the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In Step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the rear voltages for image formation are supplied to the rear electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for different colors. On the other hand, the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transported from a sheet feed cassette not shown to the resist roller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to move to the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with a specified timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> For a transition to the image formation period, the movement of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is switched to a low speed in Step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> where it is determined whether or not the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotating normally, similarly to Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. If it is determined that the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is not rotating normally, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> where the belt driving roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the fixing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are halted. Then, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> where the image forming apparatus displays an error and is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> If it is determined in Step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotating normally, on the other hand, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transported to a position opposing the toner supplying unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y in Step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> initiates, based on a detection signal from the belt rotation sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the application of the image voltage corresponding to the image signal from the outside to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided in the unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y. Responsively, the toner on the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y passes through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provided in the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to reach the surface of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> held on the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> moves consistently thereon and the specified voltage is supplied sequentially to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, whereby a toner image is formed by the yellow toner on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> When the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transported to the position opposing the toner supplying unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M, the same process performed in the unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y is performed so that a magenta toner image is superimposed on the yellow toner image on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The same process is also performed in the toner supplying units <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>BK so that color toner images in four colors are formed eventually on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> holding the color toner images is separated from the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to enter the fixing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In the fixing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the color toner images are fixed onto the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so that the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is discharged therefrom into a sheet discharge tray not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> By the foregoing process, a color image is printed on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In the toner supplying units <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>Y, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>M, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>BK for different colors through which the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has passed, the application of the image voltages is stopped successively in Step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. After that, the supply of the voltages to the rear electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also stopped in Step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Then, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> where the rotative driving of the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is stopped and then to Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> For a transition to the printhead cleaning period, the movement of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is switched to a high speed in Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, similarly to Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Then, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> where it is determined whether or not the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotating normally. If it is determined that the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is not operating normally, the same operations as performed in Steps S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are performed in Steps S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. If it is determined that the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is operating normally, the whole process moves to Step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> where the head cleaning operation is performed, similarly to Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Even after the image formation period is completed, the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are cleaned preferably by ejecting the toners in a large amount. This is because, even if the image forming apparatus is left unused for a long period of time after the image forming operation, the removal of the toners adhered to the peripheries of the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> prevents the toners that has denatured with variations in environmental conditions from adhering to the heads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Then, the whole process advances to Step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> where the supply of low voltages that have been applied to the rear electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in Step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is stopped, whereby the electric field between the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is extinguished. Then, in Step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the application of the reference voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of each of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is halted. As a result, the electric field formed between the control electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the toner holding members <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is extinguished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> from which the image receiving member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was separated is cleaned by the belt cleaning unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the toner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> adhered to the surface of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is removed from the surface of the belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> When the surface of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> opposed to the toner supplying units for different colors passes through at least the cleaning unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in Step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the rotation of the belt driving roller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is stopped and the rotative driving of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is stopped. The driving of the fixing unit is also stopped, whereby the printing operation performed by the image forming apparatus according to EMBODIMENT 2 of the present invention is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The detailed image forming operation and the operation of cleaning the heads between consecutive sheets are performed in the same manner as in EMBODIMENT 1. In the case of sequential printing, the toners are gradually deposited at localized points on the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. To eliminate the localized deposition of the toners, the head cleaning step is performed preferably between consecutive sheets. In terms of the head cleaning ability, the amounts of the toners ejected in the cleaning step performed between consecutive sheets is preferably equal to those ejected in each of the cleaning steps performed prior to the initiation of the image formation period and after the completion thereof. If the toners are ejected in large amounts, however, the problems of in-apparatus contamination and the clogging of the passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the toners deposited on the belt are aggravated. To prevent the large amounts of ejected toners from adhering to the image forming member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a wide space should be provided between consecutive sheets so that the number of sheets printed per unit time is reduced. If the transporting speed of the belt is increased between consecutive sheets, the aforementioned problems can be solved. However, since printing in the different colors is performed simultaneously, the transporting speed of the belt cannot be changed midway. Therefore, the amounts of ejected toners and the transporting speed of the belt are maintained preferably in the head cleaning step performed between consecutive sheets during the image formation period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Thus, EMBODIMENT 2 performs the steps of cleaning the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> prior to the initiation of the image formation period and after the completion thereof by ejecting the toners larger in amounts than during the image formation period and increasing the moving speed of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in addition to the operations shown in EMBODIMENT 1. This ensures the cleaning of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and prevents the in-apparatus contamination due to the jumped toners and the clogging of the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the toners deposited on the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Although EMBODIMENT 2 has performed the ejection of the toners during the cleaning of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> after the movement of the transportation belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is initiated, the ejection of the toners is not limited to the period during which the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are cleaned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The cleaning of each of the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may also be initiated after the rotation of the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It is also possible to form an electric field between the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after the cleaning of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Although EMBODIMENT 2 has used a dry toner as a developer, other toners including a wet toner having toner particles dispersed in a fluid dispersion and a liquid ink having a pigment or dye dispersed therein may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Although the present embodiment has applied the reference voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, it is also possible to apply a voltage of the polarity opposite to that of the reference voltage to the toner holding member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, a voltage outputted from the voltage source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for control electrode is required to have only the positive polarity. This prevents an increase in the size of the voltage source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for control electrode and an intricate process of designing an IC or transistor for switching the voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> between the ON/OFF states. If an antistatic electrode is provided on the outermost surface of the printhead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the same effects are achievable by applying the reference voltage to the antistatic electrode instead of applying it to the control electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Although EMBODIMENT 2 has performed head cleaning between the plurality of image receiving members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, head cleaning need not be performed between each consecutive two of the image receiving members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and may be performed as required. For example, the image forming apparatus may be internally equipped with a counter for counting the number of times that the receiving members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> pass through the positions opposing the printheads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that head cleaning is performed when the number of times reaches a specified value. Head cleaning may also be performed immediately after a power supply for the apparatus is turned ON or during a stand-by period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> In the image forming method and apparatus according to the present invention which eject the developer on the developer supplying member toward the opposing member through the openings of the printhead, the developer is prevented from being deposited at a localized point on the opposing member so that the developer on the opposing member is kept from contact with the printhead and the clogging of the openings is prevented. This reduces the probability of collision between developers on the opposing member and prevents in-apparatus contamination due to the jumped toner. Accordingly, the present invention is high in industrial applicability in terms of promoting commercialization of the image forming method and apparatus capable of providing a quality image. </paragraph>
