<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Passwords consisting of symbols selected from a third set of third symbols, of which a first set constitutes a subset of the first symbols, can be created from a data structure. The method for obtaining this structure comprises the following steps: preparation of a second set of at least two second symbols; creation of a first number of first lists of the first symbols, each list being contained in a third list constituted of the third symbols; creation of a second list of the second symbols, each symbol appearing in that list only once; association of a first list with each symbol of the second list; association of a second symbol to each symbol of the first lists. With this structure (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>), a multitude of pseudo-aleatory passwords can be created by means of a code comprising a second symbol, a subcode of at least one first symbol, and a reading path (<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>) of the symbols in the third lists of the structure, starting from a first symbol found by using the second symbol and the subcode. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention refers to a method according to the preamble of claim 1. The invention further refers to a product obtained according to the method and to a method using that product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Every user of information technology has already been confronted with the problem of choosing an access password. The difficulty is to remember the password. This is why most people use words that are easy to remember, such as proper or common names that are often related to their activities. Furthermore, many people use the same password for a plurality of systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure a high security in the area of IT networks and business computing, it is advisable or even compulsory to use passwords that are sufficiently long, not trivial (i.e. easy to guess), and where letters, numbers, and other special characters are mixed. In addition, it is necessary to use a different password for each system and to change passwords regularly. Of course, it is highly unadvisable to write down the passwords, they must be memorized. Hence, there is a conflict between the requirements of IT security and the memorizing faculty of users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a method for creating a data structure that can be used, e.g. in the form of a readable representation or stored on a disk, in order to create passwords requiring considerably reduced memorizing efforts of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such a method is defined in independent claim 1. The dependent claims refer to preferred embodiments, to a product obtained in this manner, and to an application mode of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The invention is part of a novel identification system that allows to create passwords, i.e. sequences of determined symbols, and to memorize them according to a single principle that is valid for all created passwords. The application of the principle used for creating the passwords enables a system to retrieve them. Without knowledge of the principle, this is impossible.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The system comprises an encoding system, a password creation system, and an identification system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Encoding System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The encoding system is based on the list of symbols participating in the composition of the passwords and on a list of arbitrary chosen symbols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> For a better understanding of the following text, the symbols participating in the composition of the passwords are called &ldquo;characters&rdquo;, and the arbitrary chosen symbols are called &ldquo;symbols&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The encoding system creates a matrix whose dimensions are determined, on one hand, by the number of &ldquo;characters&rdquo; and, on the other hand, by the number of &ldquo;symbols&rdquo;. Thus, the encoding system creates a matrix comprising a number of columns equal to the number of &ldquo;characters&rdquo; and a number of rows equal to the number of &ldquo;symbols&rdquo;, or vice-versa. In fact, for the following explanation, the first case will be chosen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The encoding system arbitrary distributes all of the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; of the list of symbols participating in the composition of passwords on the first row of the matrix. The encoding system repeats the operation with a new list of &ldquo;characters&rdquo; on the second row, and so on, until the matrix is full. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The encoding system adds a column to the matrix. All of the &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; of the list of arbitrary symbols are distributed on this column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Then, the encoding system associates one of the &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; to each one of the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; of the matrix exactly once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> For this purpose, the encoding system may prepare as many lists of arbitrary symbols in storage locations as there are &ldquo;characters&rdquo;. It arbitrary arranges the &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; of each list and associates each one of the latter to one of the &ldquo;characters&rdquo;. Then, the encoding system searches every case of the matrix and reads the &ldquo;character&rdquo; inscribed therein, and subsequently selects one of the &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; contained in the list that is associated to that character. The encoding system repeats this operation on every case of the matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The encoding system stores or prints the matrix on a medium of any kind so as to allow it to be transported physically or electronically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Password Creation System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The password creation system chooses a code composed of one or a plurality of &ldquo;characters&rdquo; selected from the list of symbols participating in the composition of passwords. Then, it creates a matrix from which it chooses one of the cases as the so-called starting cell. Subsequently, in the created matrix, it will choose a &ldquo;reading path&rdquo; according to which it proceeds in relation to the starting cell. The &ldquo;reading path&rdquo; is composed of the sequence of relative coordinates with respect to the position of the starting cell. The &ldquo;reading path&rdquo; is not subject to any rule and may be discontinuous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In order to create a password, the password creation system uses the matrix encoded by the encoding system. It chooses one of the &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; as a &ldquo;starting point&rdquo;. It searches the row associated to the &ldquo;starting point symbol&rdquo; and compares the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; in this row to the first &ldquo;character&rdquo; it has chosen for its code. When it hits the same &ldquo;character&rdquo;, the password creation system reads the &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; associated to that &ldquo;character&rdquo; in the matrix. It subsequently searches the row to which the new &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; is associated and compares the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; to the second &ldquo;character&rdquo; it has chosen for its code. The operation is repeated until the last &ldquo;character&rdquo; it has chosen for its code has been found in the matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Then, the password creation system reads the characters by moving through the matrix according to the previously created &ldquo;reading path&rdquo; and using the cell containing the last located &ldquo;character&rdquo; as the starting cell. The created password is composed of the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; read according to this procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The created password is transmitted to the identification system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Identification System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In order to be accepted by the identification system, the matrix encoded by the encoding system and the code, the &ldquo;reading path&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;starting point symbol&rdquo; used by the password creation system must be transmitted to the identification system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With the provided elements, the identification system applies the same principle as that used for creating the password, and compares the obtained password to that transmitted by the password creation system. If they match, the identification is accepted, otherwise it isn&apos;t. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Alternatives with Additional Elements </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It is possible to enlarge the matrix by including arbitrary distributed free cells in order to add additional elements such as special characters. These additional elements do not play any role for the encoding system, which ignores them. In contrast, they are taken into account by the password creation system in the readout according to the predefined path. This allows the passwords to include special characters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Alternatives in Password Creation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The elements required for password creation may be partly determined by the identification system. The latter may transmit a part of the code required for password creation to the password creation system, and this part may be changed at every identification. In the password creation, the password creation system integrates these elements and then transmits the password or passwords to the identification system. The identification system also integrates these elements at identification time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> This allows using a different password for each identification, which may be useful for applications requiring a &ldquo;challenge-response&rdquo; or a unique password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Advantages of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is not necessary to transmit the unencoded password for identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The password creation system may repeatedly use the same principle for creating different passwords by simply exchanging the &ldquo;starting point symbol&rdquo; or by exchanging the encoded matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The passwords are not stored or printed in the unencoded form. It is practically impossible to retrieve them in the encoded matrix without knowing the applied password creation principle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The encoding system allows creating an almost unlimited number of different encoded matrixes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The encoding matrix may be printed, and it is possible to find the password manually in order to gain access to simple systems without an automatic identification system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Realization of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The realization of the identification system according to the example includes four steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> 1. Choice of the elements </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> 2. Encoding of the matrix </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> 3. Creation of a password </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> 4. Identification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Choice of the Elements </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The elements are chosen in function of the systems for which they are used. In our example, we will use a restricted number of elements for the sake of simplicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The symbols participating in the composition of the passwords will be chosen among the following symbols <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>: &ldquo;A B C D E&rdquo; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The symbols <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> &ldquo;hearts&rdquo;, &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo;, &ldquo;clubs&rdquo;, and &ldquo;spades&rdquo; will serve as arbitrarily chosen symbols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Encoding of the Matrix </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The encoding system creates e.g. a matrix <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> including 5 columns and 4 rows, corresponding to the number of available &ldquo;characters&rdquo; <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The encoding system arbitrarily distributes the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; on the first row <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the matrix, for example: &ldquo;C B A D E&rdquo;. It repeats the operation on the second row <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the third row <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the fourth row <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A matrix <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;C B A D E&rdquo;, &ldquo;A C D B E&rdquo;, &ldquo;E C D B A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B A C E D&rdquo;) as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The encoding system adds a column <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the matrix and distributes the symbols <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the list of arbitrarily symbols on the latter, e.g. &ldquo;hearts diamonds clubs spades&rdquo; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The encoding system stores five lists of &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (since there are <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> &ldquo;characters&rdquo;) in which it arbitrary arranges the symbols <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, e.g. &ldquo;hearts clubs diamonds spades&rdquo; <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;spades diamonds clubs hearts&rdquo; <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;clubs hearts spades diamonds&rdquo; <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;hearts spades diamonds clubs&rdquo; <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;spades hearts diamonds clubs&rdquo; <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The encoding system associates one of the lists of &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to each &ldquo;character&rdquo; <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. For example, it associates the first list <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to character &ldquo;A&rdquo; <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the second list <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to character &ldquo;B&rdquo; <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the third list <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to character &ldquo;C&rdquo; <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the fourth list <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to character &ldquo;D&rdquo; <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the fifth list <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to character &ldquo;E&rdquo; <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The encoding system searches the matrix and associates with each &ldquo;character&rdquo; <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the following &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extracted from the associated list <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of &ldquo;symbols&rdquo;. Thus, on the first row, it associates &ldquo;clubs&rdquo; with &ldquo;C&rdquo;, &ldquo;spades&rdquo; with &ldquo;B&rdquo;, &ldquo;hearts&rdquo; with &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;hearts&rdquo; with &ldquo;D&rdquo;, and &ldquo;spades&rdquo; with &ldquo;E&rdquo;. It applies the same method to each row of the table, thus obtaining matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Creation of a Password </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The password creation system uses the encoded matrix. It creates a coordinate system allowing it to find each cell of matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> by its absolute coordinates. For example, it uses the first case <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> at the top left of matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> as the origin and numbers from 0 on the abscissa and the ordinate (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The password creation system creates an arbitrary matrix <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, e.g. of 5 rows and 4 columns, and chooses a cell as the starting cell <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and as the origin (<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>). It chooses a &ldquo;reading path&rdquo;, e.g. consisting of a displacement from cell <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> above the starting cell by two cells <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the right, and then by two cells <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> down. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> describes the &ldquo;reading path&rdquo;, starting cell <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is indicated by an &ldquo;X&rdquo;, and cells <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> constituting the path are numbered from 1 to 5. The system stores the relative coordinates <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of each cell <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the path in relation to starting cell <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Then, the password creation system chooses a code composed e.g. of two &ldquo;characters&rdquo; <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>: &ldquo;D B&rdquo;. It also chooses a &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a &ldquo;starting point&rdquo;, e.g. &ldquo;clubs&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In order to create the password, the system searches the column <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of encoded matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> that only contains &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and compares the &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; of that column to the symbol it has chosen as a &ldquo;starting point&rdquo;, i.e. &ldquo;clubs&rdquo; <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). When they match, it memorizes the row on which this &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is located, i.e. in our example the third row. It searches that row and compares the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the first one of its code, i.e. &ldquo;D&rdquo;. When the characters match, it stores the &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> associated to that character <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in the matrix, i.e. in our example &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The system again searches the column <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> containing only &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; and now compares the &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the one just stored (&ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>). When they match, it memorizes the row <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on which that &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; is located. It searches row <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and compares the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the second &ldquo;character&rdquo; of its code (&ldquo;B&rdquo;). When the characters match, the system stores cell <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, in which that character is located, as this is the last character in its code. In our example, the system stores the cell (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) as the starting cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In relation to this starting cell <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and according to the previously determined &ldquo;reading path&rdquo;, the system reads out the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; present in matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, it is sufficient to add the relative coordinates <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the &ldquo;reading path&rdquo; to the absolute coordinates of starting cell <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). If the values obtained by the system are outside the limits of matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the system creates a copy <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of character matrix <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and places it adjacent to first matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in order to be able to continue the &ldquo;reading path&rdquo;. To this end, column <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is ignored, i.e. a copy of matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is added on the right of the last column <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of &ldquo;characters&rdquo; <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The system can then read the cells (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>;l), and (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. From these cells, the system reads out the sequence <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of &ldquo;characters&rdquo; <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> &ldquo;DECAE&rdquo;. This is the password that is transmitted to the identification system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Identification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In order to proceed to an identification, the identification system must be provided with the encoded matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which the system will read and store. Furthermore, it must be provided with the code &ldquo;DB&rdquo; of our example, with the &ldquo;starting point symbol&rdquo; &ldquo;clubs&rdquo; and the &ldquo;reading path&rdquo; as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> With the provided elements, the identification system applies the same principle as that used for creating the password. It will find a sequence of &ldquo;characters&rdquo; and compares it to the password that has been transmitted by the password creation system. If the two sequences of characters match, the identification is successful; in the opposite case it is not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Example of Application </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> An exemplary application will be given for the access to an IT workstation (computer). Each user receives a diskette on which any encoded matrix <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is stored. Each user must be identified by the system the first time. For this purpose, the user must insert the diskette in the computer with the password creation system installed and create his or her password, i.e. a code (e.g. two letters), a &ldquo;starting point symbol&rdquo; and a &ldquo;reading path&rdquo; (that can be inscribed in a grid on the screen). Using the method described above, the system stores the created password and transmits it to the identification system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> An IT application is running on the personal computer of the user. In order to be identified, the user must insert the diskette containing the encoded matrix and provide the system with the previously chosen elements, i.e. the individual code, the &ldquo;starting point symbol&rdquo; and the &ldquo;reading path&rdquo; of that user. The identification system reads the encoded matrix from diskette and uses the same system as previously described to compare the obtained sequence of characters to the password that has been transmitted by the password creation system. If they are identical, the system authorizes the user to access the services, otherwise it doesn&apos;t. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The user may create new passwords by changing the &ldquo;starting point symbol&rdquo; or by exchanging the encoded matrix (by taking a new diskette, for example). It is no longer necessary for the user to remember his passwords, but only the elements required for creating them and which remain identical for all of his passwords, and memorizing problems are eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Of course, the scope of the invention is not limited to the cited example, and those skilled in the art may conceive modifications without leaving the scope of the invention as defined by the claims. Thus, a password may also be elaborated by the user manually by means of a graphic realization printed on a support of any kind (cardboard, plastics). The password may also be entered to a counter or a computer, etc. having no appropriate drive, by means of an standard alphanumerical keyboard or else by means of a reduced set of keys, e.g. similar to the keypad of a telephone where the keys are furthermore associated to multiple characters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is also conceivable to provide one or a plurality of rows in the matrix that are not associated with a symbol, similarly to the alternative with additional elements in one or a plurality of rows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the example of a matrix <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> containing additional elements <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (in the present case numbers) that are randomly distributed, and an additional row <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> containing numbers, i.e. additional elements as well. In order to be able to determine the password, a copy <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the matrix without column <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is adjoined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Additional elements <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> as well as additional row <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are not taken into account by the encoding system. In contrast, the password creation system takes account of the additional elements in the readout according to the predefined path. The password created when using the method described above thus becomes &ldquo;DEC2E&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the context of manual input, it will be noted that the passwords created by the described system are apparently random sequences of characters and therefore very difficult if not impossible to guess. In particular, the well-known risk of using passwords created on the basis of the name or of other personal dates or data is eliminated. </paragraph>
