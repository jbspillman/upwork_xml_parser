<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a toner passage control device, a method for manufacturing the same, and an image forming device, and particularly to a technical field in which an image is formed by controlling the flight of a toner from a toner holder toward a counter electrode with a toner passage control device having a toner passage hole so that the toner attaches to an image receiving member located between the toner passage control device and the counter electrode. Note that in the present invention, &ldquo;toner passage control device&rdquo; is referred to also as &ldquo;toner passage control means&rdquo;. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, along with the improvement in the performance of personal computers and the advancement in the network technology, there is a strong demand for a printer and a copier having a high processing capacity that can handle a large amount of documents (or that can also handle color documents). However, image forming devices that are capable of outputting black-and-white and color documents with a satisfactory quality and that have a high processing speed have still been under development and waited for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As one such device, there is known an image forming technique based on a so-called &ldquo;Toner Jet (registered trademark)&rdquo; method, in which the action of an electric field is used to allow a toner to fly onto an image receiving member such as recording paper or image holding belt, thereby forming an image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Known image forming devices of this type include those disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication for Opposition No. 44-26333, U.S. Pat. No. 3,689,935 (Japanese Patent Publication for Opposition No. 60-20747), Japanese National Phase PCT Laid-Open Publication No. 9-500842, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, for example, the device includes a grounded toner holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for holding a negatively charged toner and rotating about the central axis thereof so as to carry the toner, a limiting blade <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for controlling the toner on the toner holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in one to three layers and charging the toner, and a supply roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for supplying the toner to the toner holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and charging the toner. A counter electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field that sucks the toner is applied is arranged at a position facing the position on the toner holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to which the toner is carried, and a counter electrode power source <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for applying a positive voltage that forms the transfer electrostatic field is connected to the counter electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A toner passage control device <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided between the toner holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the counter electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> arranged in a row in a direction perpendicular to the toner carrying direction of the toner holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (i.e., a direction perpendicular to the sheet of the drawing), and a control electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> arranged around each of the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. A voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> according to an image signal from a control power source <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, such as an IC chip. Note that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is an image receiving member such as recording paper that is transferred between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the supply roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are rotated, whereby a uniform toner layer is formed on the toner holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by the limiting blade <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the toner layer is carried to a portion opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Then, a voltage is applied to the counter electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> by the counter electrode power source <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, and the image receiving member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is moved while a voltage according to an image signal is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by the control power source <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in synchronism with the movement, whereby the toner on the toner holder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> flies and attaches to the image receiving member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> according to the image signal, thus forming an intended image on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the image forming device, in order to form a high-definition image of <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> dpi (a density of 600 dots per inch (24.4 mm)), for example, across the entire surface of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to arrange the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at such a pitch. Since it is difficult to make such an arrangement in a row, the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the control electrodes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are arranged in a large number of rows (eight rows in the illustrated example) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>. The toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the control electrodes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> each have a generally circular shape, and each control electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has a wire portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>a extending in a direction perpendicular to the rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. In order to avoid interference therebetween, the wire portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>a are arranged so that the wire portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of each control electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of a row in the right half of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> extends rightward while the wire portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of each control electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of a row in the left half of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> extends leftward, and the wire portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are provided in the opposite end portions of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> interposing the rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> therebetween and are connected to an IC chip, or the like, for outputting a control voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> illustrates an example where the image receiving member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is recording paper, or the like, and an image is formed directly thereon. In such a case, the recording paper, or the like, is likely to be subject to variations in thickness, changes in quality due to humidity, deformation while being moved, etc., and in a case of a color printer, it is difficult to synchronize the image formation timings for different colors due to variations in the transfer of the recording paper, and the image quality is likely to lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is in some cases preferred to use an image holding belt as the image receiving member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that an image formed on the image holding belt is transferred onto the recording paper, or the like, at once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Such a configuration will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is an endless image holding belt used as the image receiving member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which is made of a film obtained by dispersing a conductive filler in a resin and having a resistance of about <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;&middot;cm, and is wound around a pair of rollers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is a pickup roller for feeding recording paper <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> sheet by sheet from a paper input tray <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is a timing roller for synchronization between the recording paper <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> being fed and the image position, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is a transfer roller for transferring a toner image that has been formed on the image holding belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> onto the recording paper <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>.

Reference numeral <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is a fixing device for fixing the toner image on the recording paper <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by heating/pressurizing the recording paper <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> onto which the toner image has been transferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In an image forming device having such a configuration, the amount of toner passing through a toner passage hole is significantly influenced by the interval between the toner holder and the toner passage control device, i.e., the interval between the toner holder and the control electrode. In order to address this, a scraper blade (hereinafter referred to also as &ldquo;spacer member&rdquo;) may be arranged between the toner holder and the toner passage control device so as to maintain the interval therebetween to be substantially constant, as shown in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 9-500842, for example. Specifically, the toner layer and the toner passage control device are contacted with each other via such a spacer member at a position that is in the vicinity of the toner passage holes and is on the upstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the toner passage holes, thereby maintaining the head interval between the toner layer and the toner passage control device to be substantially the same as the thickness of the spacer member. Such a configuration is desirable in maintaining the interval at an early stage of a recording operation because the toner passage control device moves along the surface of the toner holder even if the toner holder has outer shape variations, a cylindricity nonuniformity, a radial runout, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, when a recording operation is performed continuously over a long period of time with a configuration using the spacer member, toner particles accumulate accidentally and gradually on a surface of the spacer member that is in contact with the toner layer. Then, in an area of the surface of the spacer member that is in contact with the toner layer where a toner has been fused, a protrusion is formed, whereby a streak-like scratch is formed in the toner layer formed by the limiting blade in an area where it opposes the spacer member. Therefore, a streak that is extending in the secondary scanning direction (the toner holder moving direction) is transferred onto the image formed on the image receiving member. Moreover, the head interval increases as the toner fused on the spacer member surface gradually accumulates, whereby the recording characteristics change with time. Furthermore, if there occur variations in the amount of toner accumulated in the row direction of the toner passage holes (the primary scanning direction), variations occur in the head interval in the primary scanning direction, and the recording characteristics are varied by such variations, whereby a streak or a density nonuniformity in the primary scanning direction occurs in the recorded image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in a case where the spacer member provided on the toner passage control device is contacted with the toner layer on the toner holder, the spacer member normally contacts the toner layer at an edge portion (end) of the spacer member that is on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction. Therefore, if there are minute irregularities on the surface in the edge portion, the irregularities are transferred onto the toner layer, thereby scratching the toner layer and causing an image non-uniformnity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in order to form a uniform image with no streak or density nonuniformity with an image forming device that forms an image by causing the toner to selectively fly onto the image receiving member using an electric field, it is necessary to prevent the toner layer from being scratched and to maintain the surface condition of the toner layer formed on the toner holder to be substantially constant entirely across the rows of toner passage holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the head interval is a factor that significantly influences the variations in the recording characteristics. Therefore, in order to form a uniform image without non-uniformity, it is necessary to maintain the head interval to be substantially constant entirely across the rows of toner passage holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in order to allow a sufficient amount of toner for obtaining a required recording density to fly under conditions where a constant voltage is applied to the counter electrode and the control electrode, it is necessary to set the head interval to be very small (on the order of 10 &mgr;m or so). In such a case, even a slight dimensional error in the head interval leads to increased variations, whereby it is difficult to maintain the head interval to be constant entirely across the rows of toner passage holes. Moreover, there are irregularities on the surface of the toner passage control device due to the electrode pattern, etc., and such irregularities on the surface of the toner passage control device that contacts with the spacer member may possibly influence the surface precision of the spacer member. In such a case, the irregularities are transferred onto the toner layer with which the spacer member contacts, thereby causing an image non-uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Moreover, even at an early stage of a recording operation, the toner layer that is moved by the toner holder contacts the spacer member before being supplied to the rows of toner passage holes (at a position on the upstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the toner passage holes). Therefore, if there are minute irregularities or protrusions on the surface of the spacer member that is in contact with the toner layer, the toner layer contacting the spacer member is scratched, and the scratch is transferred onto the image, thereby causing a minute streak in the recorded image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In view of this, the contact pressure between the spacer member and the toner layer may be reduced so as to prevent the toner layer from being scratched. In such a case, however, it is not possible to ensure a uniform contact between the toner layer and the spacer member in the direction parallel to the rows of toner passage holes (the primary scanning direction), and a gap occurs partially. Therefore, the head interval varies in the primary scanning direction, and the recording characteristics are varied by such variations, whereby a streak or a density non-uniformity in the primary scanning direction occurs in the recorded image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> This imposes very stringent requirements in the surface roughness or flatness on the spacer member. Therefore, the component cost increases, and the assembly operation of attaching the spacer member to the toner passage control device requires very carefull handling of the spacer member, increases the number of assembly steps in mass production, and increases the occurrence of a misoperation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in a configuration in which a scraper blade is arranged between the toner holder and the toner passage control means (toner passage control device) so as to maintain the interval between the toner layer and the control electrode on the toner passage control means, as shown in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 9-500842, the toner passage control means is substantially planar while the toner holder is cylindrical. Therefore, even if the head interval between the toner layer and the toner passage control means is limited to the thickness of the scraper blade by employing such a configuration in which the toner passage control means contacts the toner layer on the toner holder via the scraper blade arranged on the toner passage control means, the head interval changes and the recording characteristics vary when the relative positional relationship between the toner passage holes and the toner holder in the toner holder moving direction. In a configuration in which a plurality of toner passage control means are provided and toners of different colors, e.g., yellow, magenta, cyan and black, are used for the plurality of toner passage control means so as to form a color image, such variations in the recording characteristics among the toner passage control means lead to variations in the hue and density, thereby creating problems in the image quality. Moreover, where the toner passage control means includes a plurality of rows of toner passage holes arranged in the toner holder moving direction in order to improve the recording resolution, the head interval varies among the rows of toner passage holes, whereby the recording characteristics vary among the toner passage holes and it is difficult to provide a control under the same condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the toner passage control means is substantially planar while the toner holder is cylindrical in such a configuration, when the toner passage control means contacts the toner layer on the toner holder via the scraper blade arranged on the toner passage control means, the scraper blade will abut on the toner layer at its edge on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction, and the stress on the toner layer is localized at the abutting position, whereby the thickness of the toner layer may decrease and a sufficient image density may not be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in order to allow a sufficient amount of toner for ensuring a required recording density to fly under a constant voltage application condition, it is necessary to set the head interval corresponding to the thickness of the scraper blade to be very small. In such a case, however, if the toner passage control means is substantially planar as described above, the toner passage control means once abuts on the toner layer at the position of the scraper blade, after which the toner passage control means and the toner layer may contact each other again at a position that is on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the abutting position. In such a case, the contact between the scraper blade and the toner layer becomes unstable, and it is difficult to stably control the head interval to be the thickness of the scraper blade, whereby the recording characteristics vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the scraper blade is attached by bonding onto the toner passage control means, the interval between the toner holder and the toner passage control means is influenced by the thickness of the bond layer, whereby it is difficult to maintain the head interval to be constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Moreover, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 9-500842 discloses a method, as an alternative method, in which the scraper blade is attached to a casing member so that it contacts the toner passage control means. However, problems as those described above occur since the toner passage control means is substantially planar while the toner holder is cylindrical. Moreover, since the toner passage control means is attached so as to be movable with respect to the casing member, the positional relationship between the toner passage holes formed in the toner passage control means and the scraper blade is unstable, and the positional relationship varies due to the outer shape variations or a runout of the toner holder. These factors cause an image non-uniformity in the primary scanning direction, thereby lowering the image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In a configuration where the toner passage holes abut on the toner layer on the toner holder via the scraper blade, or the like, in order to maintain the head interval, even if the toner holder has outer shape variations, a cylindricity non-uniformity, or a radial runout, they can be absorbed. However, since the toner passage control means and the toner holder are arranged so that they can be displaced with respect to each other, if the toner holder has outer shape variations, a cylindricity non-uniformity, or a radial runout, the positional relationship between the toner passage holes formed in the toner passage control means and the toner holder in the toner holder moving direction changes. Even in such a case, it is necessary to maintain the head interval to be constant so that the head interval does not vary as in the conventional example described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Moreover, similarly to the above, in order to allow a sufficient amount of toner for ensuring a required recording density to fly under a constant voltage application condition, it is necessary to form, on the toner holder, a toner layer of a constant thickness that corresponds to the thickness of a number of toner particle layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in order to form a uniform image with no streak or density nonuniformity, it is necessary to prevent the toner layer from being scratched and to maintain the surface condition of the toner layer formed on the toner holder to be constant entirely across the rows of toner passage holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as described above, it is necessary to maintain the positional precision of the spacer means with respect to the toner passage holes to be constant. However, precisely attaching the spacer means having a thickness on the order of 10 &mgr;m or so to the toner passage control means requires a careful assembly operation and increases the number of steps in mass production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the configuration above, the toner layer held on the toner holder contacts the spacer means at a position on the upstream side, i.e., before it is supplied to the rows of toner passage holes, whereby if there are minute irregularities or protrusions on the spacer surface that is in contact with the toner layer, the toner layer contacting the spacer is scratched, and the scratch is transferred onto the image, thereby causing a minute streak in the recorded image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> One possible way to address this problem is to reduce the contact pressure between the spacer means and the toner layer so as to prevent the toner layer from being scratched. In such a case, however, it is not possible to ensure a uniform contact between the toner layer and the spacer means in the direction parallel to the rows of toner passage holes (the primary scanning direction), and it is not possible to avoid a gap occurring partially. Therefore, the head interval increases in the gap, causing variations in the head interval in the primary scanning direction, and the recording characteristics are varied by such variations, whereby a streak or a density non-uniformity in the primary scanning direction occurs in the recorded image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> This imposes very stringent requirements in the surface roughness or flatness on the spacer means, thereby increasing the component cost. Moreover, the assembly operation of attaching the spacer means having a thickness on the order of 10 &mgr;m or so, as described above, to the toner passage control means requires very careful handling of the spacer means, increases the number of assembly steps in mass production, and increases the occurrence of a misoperation, thereby increasing the cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in view of such problems in the art, and a first object of the present invention is to provide an image forming device capable of preventing a scratch or disturbance from occurring in a toner layer on a toner holder both at an early stage of a recording operation and in a long-term use, and maintaining the interval between the toner layer and a toner passage control device to be minute and uniform entirely across rows of toner passage holes, thereby forming a high-quality image with no non-uniformity or streak across the entire printing area while ensuring a required recording density under a constant voltage application condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a second object of the present invention is to provide an image forming device capable of forming, on a toner holder, a toner layer having an appropriate thickness and a uniform surface condition, and maintaining the interval between the toner layer and toner passage control means to be minute and uniform entirely across all rows of toner passage holes, thereby stably forming a high-quality image with no non-uniformity or streak across the entire printing area while ensuring a required recording density under a constant voltage application condition without causing the image quality to lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a third object of the present invention is to provide an image forming device in which the method of attaching spacer means to toner passage control means is improved so as to improve the precision and reduce the cost for the spacer means, and which is capable of maintaining the interval between the toner layer and the toner passage control means to be minute and uniform entirely across rows of toner passage holes, thereby forming a high-quality image with no non-uniformity or streak across the entire printing area while ensuring a required recording density under a constant voltage application condition. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the objects, the present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a counter electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the toner layer formed on the toner holder is applied; a toner passage control device arranged between the toner holder and the counter electrode, the toner passage control device including an insulative member in which a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough is formed, and a control electrode provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device controls passage of the toner through the toner passage holes by a voltage applied to the control electrode according to an image signal; an image receiving member which is arranged between the toner passage control device and the counter electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches; and a spacer member having one of its surfaces in a thickness direction in contact with a surface of the toner layer being moved by the toner holder for maintaining a distance between the toner layer surface and a toner holder side opening of the toner passage hole in the toner passage control device to be substantially constant, wherein the spacer member is configured so that irregularities on a spacer member contacting surface of a contact member that contacts the other one of the surfaces of the spacer member in the thickness direction are not transferred onto the surface of the toner layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferred that the spacer member is configured so that the irregularities on the spacer member contacting surface of the contact member do not influence a smoothness of the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> With these inventions, the spacer member does not undergo a bending deformation along the irregularities on the spacer member contacting surface of the contact member, and has a sufficient flexural rigidity so as not to transfer the irregularities onto the toner layer contacting surface, whereby the smoothness of the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member is not influenced by the irregularities on the contact member surface, and the irregularities are prevented from being transferred onto the toner layer with which the spacer member contacts to cause an image non-uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferred that the contact member is the toner passage control device. In this way, even if the spacer member is contacted with the toner passage control device, irregularities due to the electrode pattern, etc., formed on the spacer member contacting surface of the toner passage control device do not influence the smoothness of the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member, and the irregularities are prevented from being transferred onto the toner layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a counter electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the toner layer formed on the toner holder is applied; a toner passage control device arranged between the toner holder and the counter electrode, the toner passage control device including an insulative member in which a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough is formed, and a control electrode provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device controls passage of the toner through the toner passage holes by a voltage applied to the control electrode according to an image signal; an image receiving member which is arranged between the toner passage control device and the counter electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches; and a spacer member in contact with a surface of the toner layer being moved by the toner holder for maintaining a distance between the toner layer surface and a toner holder side opening of the toner passage hole in the toner passage control device to be substantially constant, wherein the spacer member is configured so that a smoothness of the toner layer surface does not change after the spacer member contacts the toner layer surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, even if the toner layer is moved by the toner holder to contact the spacer member, the smoothness of the toner layer surface does not change, whereby an image non-uniformity does not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present invention provides an image forming device, including a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a counter electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the toner layer formed on the toner holder is applied; a toner passage control device arranged between the toner holder and the counter electrode, the toner passage control device including an insulative member in which a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough is formed, and a control electrode provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device controls passage of the toner through the toner passage holes by a voltage applied to the control electrode according to an image signal; an image receiving member which is arranged between the toner passage control device and the counter electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches; and a spacer member in contact with a surface of the toner layer being moved by the toner holder for maintaining a distance between the toner layer surface and a toner holder side opening of the toner passage hole in the toner passage control device to be substantially constant, wherein a surface roughness of a toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member is set to be smaller than a surface roughness of the toner layer surface before being contacted by the spacer member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In this way, the toner layer with which the spacer member contacts is prevented from being scratched by the minute irregularities or protrusions on the surface of the spacer member, thereby preventing such a scratch from being transferred onto an image to cause a minute streak in the recorded image. Moreover, the holding force of the toner particles fused on the spacer member surface is reduced, and the fused toner particles are removed by the sliding movement against the toner layer, thereby preventing the toner from gradually accumulating with the fused toner particle being a nucleus. Therefore, even in a long-term use, the toner is prevented from accumulating on the spacer member, and it is possible to prevent a streak from occurring on the recorded image due to a scratch in the toner layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a counter electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the toner layer formed on the toner holder is applied; a toner passage control device arranged between the toner holder and the counter electrode, the toner passage control device including an insulative member in which a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough is formed, and a control electrode provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device controls passage of the toner through the toner passage holes by a voltage applied to the control electrode according to an image signal; an image receiving member which is arranged between the toner passage control device and the counter electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches; and a spacer member in contact with a surface of the toner layer being moved by the toner holder for maintaining a distance between the toner layer surface and a toner holder side opening of the toner passage hole in the toner passage control device to be substantially constant, wherein a surface roughness Rz of a toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member is set to be smaller than an average particle diameter of the toner. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a counter electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the toner layer formed on the toner holder is applied; a toner passage control device arranged between the toner holder and the counter electrode, the toner passage control device including an insulative member in which a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough is formed, and a control electrode provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device controls passage of the toner through the toner passage holes by a voltage applied to the control electrode according to an image signal; an image receiving member which is arranged between the toner passage control device and the counter electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches; and a spacer member in contact with a surface of the toner layer being moved by the toner holder for maintaining a distance between the toner layer surface and a toner holder side opening of the toner passage hole in the toner passage control device to be substantially constant, wherein a surface roughness Rz of a toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member is set to be 2 to 8 &mgr;m. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a surface roughness Rz of a portion of a toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member where the spacer member contacts the toner layer is set to be 2 to 4 &mgr;m. Moreover, it is preferred that the spacer member is provided on an upstream side in a toner holder moving direction with respect to the toner passage hole, and the spacer member is configured so as to contact the toner layer in an area of the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member that is 5 mm in length from one end thereof on a downstream side in the toner holder moving direction toward an upstream side. With these inventions, it is possible to obtain an image of an even higher quality both in an initial stage of a recording operation and in a long-term use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that: the spacer member is provided on an upstream side in a toner holder moving direction with respect to the toner passage hole; and a corner portion of the spacer member between a toner layer contacting surface thereof and an end surface thereof on a downstream side in the toner holder moving direction is chamfered by a size that is equal to or greater than &frac12; of a thickness of the spacer member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In this way, an edge portion (end) of the spacer member on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder moves does not directly contact the toner layer, whereby even if there are minute irregularities on the surface of the edge portion, the stress applied on the toner layer is not localized in the edge portion. As a result, the irregularities in the edge portion are prevented from being transferred onto the toner layer, thereby preventing a scratch in the toner layer and an image non-uniformity from occurring. Moreover, this eliminates the problem that a sufficient image density cannot be obtained due to a reduced thickness of the toner layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that: the spacer member is provided on an upstream side in a toner holder moving direction with respect to the toner passage hole; and a protrusion height with respect to a surface roughness average line is set to be 4 &mgr;m or less in an area of the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member that is 1 mm in length from one end thereof on a downstream side in the toner holder moving direction toward an upstream side. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a counter electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the toner layer formed on the toner holder is applied; a toner passage control device arranged between the toner holder and the counter electrode, the toner passage control device including an insulative member in which a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough is formed, and a control electrode provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device controls passage of the toner through the toner passage holes by a voltage applied to the control electrode according to an image signal; an image receiving member which is arranged between the toner passage control device and the counter electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches; and a spacer member in contact with a surface of the toner layer being moved by the toner holder for maintaining a distance between the toner layer surface and a toner holder side opening of the toner passage hole in the toner passage control device to be substantially constant, wherein the spacer member is made of a steel strip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the spacer member does not undergo a bending deformation along the irregularities on the surface of the toner passage control device, and has a sufficient flexural rigidity so as not to transfer the irregularities onto the surface. Therefore, the irregularities are prevented from being transferred onto the toner layer with which the spacer contacts to cause an image non-uniformity. Thus, the head interval can be set to be very small, a sufficient amount of toner can be allowed to fly under a constant voltage application condition, and it is possible to ensure a required recording density. Moreover, even when a thin spacer member having a thickness of about 10 &mgr;m is bonded on the toner passage control device, the spacer member is prevented from being plastically deformed to lower its smoothness. As a result, it is possible to prevent problems such as a scratch in the toner layer or an image non-uniformity. Moreover, the work efficiency of the assembly operation can be significantly improved. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent the spacer member from wearing off by the sliding movement between the toner layer and the toner passage control device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a counter electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the toner layer formed on the toner holder is applied; a toner passage control device arranged between the toner holder and the counter electrode, the toner passage control device including an insulative member in which a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough is formed, and a control electrode provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device controls passage of the toner through the toner passage holes by a voltage applied to the control electrode according to an image signal; an image receiving member which is arranged between the toner passage control device and the counter electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches; and a spacer member in contact with a surface of the toner layer being moved by the toner holder for maintaining a distance between the toner layer surface and a toner holder side opening of the toner passage hole in the toner passage control device to be substantially constant, wherein a hardness Hv of a surface of the spacer member is set to be 400 to 600. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the spacer member is made of a stainless steel for springs or a carbon tool steel. In this way, it is possible to easily obtain a specific material of the spacer member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a counter electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the toner layer formed on the toner holder is applied; a toner passage control device arranged between the toner holder and the counter electrode, the toner passage control device including an insulative member in which a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough is formed, and a control electrode provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device controls passage of the toner through the toner passage holes by a voltage applied to the control electrode according to an image signal; an image receiving member which is arranged between the toner passage control device and the counter electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches; and a spacer member in contact with a surface of the toner layer being moved by the toner holder for maintaining a distance between the toner layer surface and a toner holder side opening of the toner passage hole in the toner passage control device to be substantially constant, wherein the spacer member is made of a sheet obtained by subjecting a resin material to a surface treatment using an antistatic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In this way, the spacer member can be provided by using a resin, thus reducing the cost. Moreover, even when a resin is used, it is possible to prevent the toner from being newly charged by the sliding movement between the spacer member and the toner layer, and thus preventing the toner from electrostatically attaching to the spacer member surface. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent the spacer member from wearing off by the sliding movement between the toner layer and the toner passage control device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a surface resistance of the antistatic material is set to be 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr; or less. Moreover, the antistatic material is made of a boron-based polymer. With these inventions, it is possible to effectively prevent the toner from being newly charged by the sliding movement between the spacer member and the toner layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a surface of the spacer member is electrically grounded. In this way, it is possible to even more effectively prevent the toner from electrostatically attaching to the spacer member surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a counter electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the toner layer formed on the toner holder is applied; a toner passage control device arranged between the toner holder and the counter electrode, the toner passage control device including an insulative member in which a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough is formed, and a control electrode provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device controls passage of the toner through the toner passage holes by a voltage applied to the control electrode according to an image signal; an image receiving member which is arranged between the toner passage control device and the counter electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches; and a spacer member in contact with a surface of the toner layer being moved by the toner holder for maintaining a distance between the toner layer surface and a toner holder side opening of the toner passage hole in the toner passage control device to be substantially constant. The spacer member is configured so as to contact the toner layer surface on a downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the toner passage hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferred that the spacer member is configured so as not to contact the toner layer surface on an upstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the toner passage hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> With these inventions, even if there are minute irregularities or protrusions on the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member, thereby scratching the toner layer contacting the spacer member, the scratched toner layer has already supplied the toner to the toner passage hole, whereby a disturbance in the toner layer due to such a scratch is prevented from being transferred onto the recorded image to cause a minute streak in the recorded image. Therefore, very stringent requirements in the surface roughness or flatness are not imposed on the spacer member, thereby reducing the component cost. Moreover, the manufacturing step of forming the spacer member does not require a very carefull operation for the formation and handling of the spacer member, thereby reducing the number of assembly steps in mass production, and reducing the frequency of occurrence of a misoperation or a defective. Furthermore, when a recording operation is performed continuously over a long period of time, toner particles may accidentally attach to the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member, and the toner particles may gradually accumulate with an attached toner particle being a nucleus, thereby forming a protrusion in an area of the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member where the toner has been fused. Even in such a case, the disturbance in the toner layer due to the protrusion is prevented from being transferred onto the recorded image to cause a minute streak in the recorded image, as described above. Thus, it is possible to prevent the reliability from lowering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that an end portion of the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member that is on an upstream side in the toner holder moving direction is inclined away from the toner layer in a direction toward the upstream side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Specifically, when the toner layer enters the area where the spacer member is located, the toner layer is easily scratched off by a corner portion of the spacer member between the toner layer contacting surface thereof and the end surface on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder moves, in which case the toner, which has been scratched off, accumulates in the space between the toner passage control device and the toner holder, and the accumulated toner is ejected from the toner passage hole during a non-image forming period, thereby causing a so-called &ldquo;fogging phenomenon&rdquo;. With this invention, however, the end portion of the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member that is on the upstream side in the toner holder moving direction is inclined away from the toner layer in a direction toward the upstream side, whereby the toner layer is not scratched off, and the toner layer smoothly enters the area where the spacer member is located, thereby suppressing the occurrence of the &ldquo;fogging phenomenon&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The spacer member is formed by covering a spacer film formed on the insulative member of the toner passage control device with a protection layer. Moreover, it is preferred that the spacer film is formed by a vapor deposition step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> With these inventions, the spacer member, which is as thin as about 10 &mgr;m, can be easily and stably formed, as compared to a method in which a spacer member of a metal sheet, or the like, which has been cut to a predetermined size is attached to the surface of the toner passage control device. Moreover, in a method in which the spacer member having a thickness of about 10 &mgr;m to which flatness, etc., is required is attached to the toner passage control device, the spacer member is easily deformed in the assembly operation. However, there is no such problem, and it is possible to further reduce the number of assembly steps in mass production and to further reduce the frequency of occurrence of a misoperation or a defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the spacer film is made of an insulative material. In this way, it is possible to form the spacer film directly on the insulative member, on which the control electrode has been formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferred that a surface of the protection layer is subjected to a surface treatment using an antistatic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In this way, it is possible to prevent the toner from being excessively charged by the sliding movement between the spacer member and the toner layer, and to prevent the toner from electrostatically attaching to the spacer member surface. Moreover, even if excessive charging occurs, what is newly charged by the sliding movement against the spacer member is the toner, which has already supplied the toner to the toner passage hole, and it will not influence the flight characteristics of the toner through the toner passage hole to cause the image density, the pixel forming position, etc., to vary. Therefore, the level of antistatic performance required for the spacer member may be low as long as it is possible to prevent the toner from electrostatically attaching to the spacer member surface, and may be lower than that in a case where the spacer member is contacted with the toner layer on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder moves with respect to the toner passage hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a surface resistance of the antistatic material is set to be 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr; or less. Moreover, it is preferred that the antistatic material is made of a boron-based polymer. With these inventions, it is possible to effectively prevent the toner from being newly charged by the sliding movement between the spacer member and the toner layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the surface of the protection layer is electrically grounded. In this way, it is possible to even more effectively prevent the toner from electrostatically attaching to the spacer member surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present invention provides a toner passage control device arranged so as to oppose a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer, the toner passage control device including an insulative member and a control electrode, the insulative member including a toner passage hole row formed therein, the toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough arranged in a direction perpendicular to a toner holder moving direction, and the control electrode being provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device controls passage of the toner through the toner passage holes by a voltage applied to the control electrode according to an image signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the invention: a spacer member is provided so as to be in contact with a toner layer surface being moved by the toner holder for maintaining a distance between the toner layer surface and a toner holder side opening of the toner passage hole in the toner passage control device to be substantially constant; and the spacer member is configured so as to contact the toner layer surface at least on a downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the toner passage hole. Thus, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained by using the toner passage control device in an image forming device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The spacer member is configured so as not to contact the toner layer surface on an upstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the toner passage hole.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that an end portion of the toner layer contacting surface of the spacer member that is on an upstream side in the toner holder moving direction is inclined away from the toner layer in a direction toward the upstream side. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the spacer member is formed by covering a spacer film formed on the insulative member with a protection layer. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the spacer film is formed by a vapor deposition step. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the spacer film is made of an insulative material. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a surface of the protection layer is subjected to a surface treatment using an antistatic material. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a surface resistance of the antistatic material is set to be 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr; or less. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the antistatic material is made of a boron-based polymer. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the surface of the protection layer is electrically grounded. In this way, functions/effects as those of the invention described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a back electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the holder is applied; toner passage control means arranged between the toner holder and the back electrode for controlling passage of the toner through toner passage holes by applying a voltage to a control electrode according to an image signal, the control electrode being provided on an insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, the insulative member including a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough; and image receiving means which is arranged between the toner passage control means and the back electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches, the image forming device employing a configuration wherein: the toner passage control means is provided with spacer means in contact with the toner layer held on the toner holder for limiting a distance between the toner layer and an opening of the toner passage hole; and the toner passage control means includes a portion, which has a curvature and is arranged while being spaced apart from the toner layer, in an area other than an area where the spacer means contacts the toner layer held on the toner holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, even if the position of the toner passage hole row in the toner holder moving direction varies due to factors such as an error in the attachment of the toner passage control means via the fixing means, the head interval at the position of the row of toner passage holes is maintained to be equal to the thickness of the spacer means, thereby preventing the recording characteristics from varying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is possible to prevent the problem that after the spacer means once abuts on the toner layer at a position in the contact area where the toner layer is contacted, the toner passage control means and the toner layer may contact each other again at a position on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the abutting position. As a result, it is possible to prevent the problem that the contact between the spacer means and the toner layer may become unstable in the intended contact area, thereby varying the head interval and thus varying the recording characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a back electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner of the holder is applied; toner passage control means arranged between the toner holder and the back electrode for controlling passage of the toner through toner passage holes by applying a voltage to a control electrode according to an image signal, the control electrode being provided on an insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, the insulative member including a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough; and image receiving means which is arranged between the toner passage control means and the back electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches, the image forming device employing a configuration wherein the toner passage control means includes a portion, which has a curvature and is arranged while being spaced apart from the toner layer, in an area other than an area where the toner passage control means contacts the toner layer held on the toner holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the toner passage control means abuts directly on the toner layer without the spacer means therebetween, whereby it is possible to reduce the interval between the toner layer and the toner passage control means, thereby reducing the applied voltage to the control electrode that is required for the toner flight for obtaining a sufficient recording density, in addition to the effects of claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that in an area which is other than the area where the toner passage control means or the spacer means contacts the toner layer and in which the toner passage control means is arranged while being spaced apart from the toner layer, the curvature of the toner passage control means gradually decreases in a direction away from the contact area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the head interval between the toner layer on the toner holder and the toner passage control means gradually increases in the direction away from the lower end portion of the contact area, and the toner passage control means has a curvature approximate to that of the toner holder in the vicinity of the lower end portion of the contact area. Therefore, in the area between the vicinity of the lower end portion of the contact area and the vicinity of the position at which the toner holder and the image receiving means come closest to each other, the amount of increase in the head interval is very small, and the head interval is maintained to be equal to the thickness of the spacer means in this area. Thus, even if the position of the toner passage hole row in the toner holder moving direction varies, the variations in the head interval at the position of the row of toner passage holes can be reduced, thereby preventing the recording characteristics from varying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that in an area which is other than the area where the toner passage control means or the spacer means contacts the toner layer and in which the toner passage control means is arranged while being spaced apart from the toner layer, the curvature of the toner passage control means is constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the curvature of the toner passage control means in an area where it is spaced apart from the toner layer can be made substantially equal to the curvature thereof in the contact area and substantially constant in the spaced-apart area. In this way, as compared to the invention described above where the curvature continuously changes in the spaced-apart area, it is possible to reduce the amount of increase in the head interval on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction, and to reduce the variations in the recording characteristics due to the variations in the head interval caused by the change in the position of the row of toner passage holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the curvature of the toner passage control means in the vicinity of the toner passage hole is substantially the same as the curvature of the toner passage control means in the contact area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the interval between the toner layer and the toner passage control means in the vicinity of the toner passage hole can be limited to the thickness of the spacer means, and it is possible to stabilize the toner flight and reduce the applied voltage to the control electrode that is required for the toner flight for obtaining a sufficient recording density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a bent member contacting the toner passage control means for limiting the curvature of the toner passage control means is provided in an area other than the area where the toner passage control means or the spacer means contacts the toner layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the curvature of the toner passage control means can be substantially equal to the curvature of the toner holder at one end, and can be substantially equal to the curvature of the bent portion at the other end, and the curvature of the toner passage control means in the area therebetween, where the toner passage control means is spaced apart from the toner layer, can be set to a curvature that continuously changes between the two different curvatures. Thus, the configuration of the invention described above can be embodied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the area where the toner passage control means or the spacer means contacts the toner layer is in a positional relationship such that it does not cross a straight line that extends between a center of the toner holder and a position at which the toner holder and the image receiving means come closest to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, it is possible to prevent the head interval from varying due to the change in the position of the row of toner passage holes and to arrange the row of toner passage holes at the position at which the toner holder and the image receiving means come closest to each other, whereby it is possible to minimize the head interval and the distance between the toner passage control means and the image receiving means, thereby stabilizing the toner flight, and to reduce the applied voltage to the control electrode that is required for the toner flight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the spacer means is substantially parallel to a peripheral portion of the toner holder in the area where the spacer means contacts the toner layer, and an end portion of the spacer means on the toner passage hole side is a terminal portion of the contact area on the toner passage hole side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the toner layer smoothly enters the contact area, and the spacer means contacts the toner layer over a large area while the edge of the spacer means on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction will not be brought into a linear contact with the toner layer. Thus, it is possible to prevent the stress applied on the toner layer from being localized at the abutting position, thereby reducing the thickness of the toner layer and failing to obtain a sufficient image density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Moreover, even if there are minute irregularities on the surface of the edge portion, the edge portion will not abut directly on the toner layer, and the irregularities are prevented from being transferred onto the toner layer, thereby preventing a scratch in the toner layer and an image non-uniformity from occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that an end portion of the spacer means on the toner passage hole side is subjected to a chamfer process or an R process. With such a configuration, further effects can be obtained in addition to those of the invention described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the toner passage control means and the toner holder come closest to each other in the vicinity of the toner passage hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, it is possible to minimize the interval between the toner passage control means and the toner layer and the distance between the toner passage control means and the image receiving means, so as to stabilize the toner flight and reduce the applied voltage to the control electrode that is required for the toner flight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the toner passage control means is provided with a plurality of toner passage hole rows, and the plurality of toner passage hole rows are arranged on both sides with respect to a straight line that extends between a center of the toner holder and a position at which the toner holder and the image receiving means come closest to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, even where the toner passage control means includes a plurality of rows of toner passage holes arranged in the toner holder moving direction in order to improve the recording resolution, the recording characteristics will not vary among the toner passage hole rows due to variations in the head interval among the toner passage hole rows, thereby enabling a control for the plurality of toner passage hole rows under the same condition and simplifying the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that one of end portions of the toner passage control means in a toner holder moving direction is fixed while the other one of the end portions is held via an elastic member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, even if the toner holder has outer diameter variations, a cylindricity non-uniformity, or a radial runout, the toner passage control means is moved along the peripheral surface of the toner holder, whereby such variations can be absorbed, and even if the positional relationship between the toner passage hole formed in the toner passage control means and the toner holder in the toner holder moving direction varies due to the outer diameter variations, or the like, the head interval at the position of the toner passage hole does not vary and can be maintained to be constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention provides an image forming device, including: a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer; a back electrode which is arranged at a position opposing a toner carrying position of the toner holder and to which a voltage for forming a transfer electrostatic field for sucking the toner on the holder is applied; toner passage control means arranged between the toner holder and the back electrode, the toner passage control means including an insulative member including a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough, and a control electrode provided on the insulative member along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein a voltage according to an image signal is applied to the control electrode so as to successively control passage of the toner through the toner passage holes; and image receiving means which is arranged between the toner passage control means and the back electrode and to which the toner having passed through the toner passage holes attaches, wherein: the toner passage control means is provided with distance limiting means in contact with the toner layer held on the toner holder for limiting a distance between the toner layer and an opening of the toner passage hole; and the distance limiting means is fixed to the toner passage control means by fixing means which is located in an area other than an area where the distance limiting means contacts the toner layer on the toner holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferred that the fixing means is located in an area other than the area where the distance limiting means contacts the toner layer on the toner holder in a toner holder moving direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> With these configurations, even if the thickness of the fixing means for fixing the distance limiting means and the toner passage control means to each other has individual variations or variations in the toner passage hole row direction, the spatial distance (head interval) between the surface of the toner layer formed on the toner holder and the surface of the toner passage control means will not be influenced and caused to change, whereby it is possible to constantly maintain the interval to be equal to the thickness of the distance limitation itself entirely across the row of toner passage holes, and to form a uniform image without non-uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in order to allow a sufficient amount of toner for ensuring a required recording density to fly under a constant voltage application condition, it is necessary to set the head interval to be very small. In such a case, however, even a slight head interval variation results in a relatively increased degree of variation, whereby it is typically very difficult to obtain a constant recording density entirely across the row of toner passage holes without non-uniformity. However, with the configuration of the present invention, the head interval is maintained by the thickness of the distance limiting means itself irrespective of the variations in the thickness of the adhesive layer. Therefore, it is possible to easily ensure a minute head interval, and to form a uniform image without nonuniformity entirely across the row of toner passage holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferred that the fixing means is located in an area which is other than the area where the distance limiting means contacts the toner layer on the toner holder in a toner holder moving direction and which is located on an upstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the contact area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the frictional force applied from the toner holder to the distance limiting means in the contact area where the toner layer and the distance limiting means contact each other equals the tensile force that acts on the distance limiting means. Therefore, even when the distance limiting means is made of a very thin member, the distance limiting means will not be buckled or bent, and the flatness of the distance limiting means is desirably ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the fixing means is arranged at a position where the fixing means does not contact the toner layer on the toner holder. With such a configuration, it is possible to prevent an image non-uniformity due to the toner layer being disturbed on the upstream side with respect to the contact area where the toner layer and the distance limiting means contact each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the fixing means is an adhesive layer formed at an interface between the distance limiting means and the toner passage control means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, even if the thickness of the fixing means for fixing the distance limiting means and the toner passage control means to each other has individual variations or variations in the toner passage hole row direction, the head interval will not be influenced and caused to change, whereby it is possible to constantly maintain the interval to be equal to the thickness of the distance limiting means itself entirely across the row of toner passage holes, and to form a uniform image without non-uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that: the fixing means is adhesive means; and the distance limiting means is arranged on a side such as to seal an end portion in a toner holder moving direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the distance limiting means and the toner passage control means can be in close contact with each other across the entire area of the distance limiting means in the toner holder moving direction. Therefore, the distance limiting means is not bent, and the flatness of the distance limiting means can be improved, whereby the corrugation of the distance limiting means in the contact area where the toner layer and the distance limiting means contact each other in the direction parallel to the row of toner passage holes can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that: the fixing means is an adhesive tape; and the fixing means is attached over the toner passage control means and the distance limiting means so that the distance limiting means covers an end portion in a toner holder moving direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, as compared to a case where a sealing material is used as the fixing means for fixing the distance limiting means and the toner passage control means to each other, the adhesive application step, the curing step and the drying step can be omitted, thereby significantly improving the assembly efficiency in fixing the distance limiting means to the toner passage control means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the thickness of the fixing means itself is reduced and the thickness has a reduced variation, whereby it is possible to reduce the distance of the space between the toner layer and the fixing means that is provided for preventing the fixing means and the toner layer from contacting each other. In this way, the fixing means can be arranged at a position close to the toner holder, and the length of the distance limiting means in the toner holder moving direction can be reduced, thereby reducing the size of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the fixing means is arranged in a direction parallel to the toner passage hole row and over a larger area than the toner passage hole row. With such a configuration, the head interval can be precisely maintained to be constant across the entire length of the row of toner passage holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the fixing means is arranged while being divided into a plurality of portions in a direction parallel to the toner passage hole row. With such a configuration, in the step of bonding and fixing the distance limiting means to the toner passage control means, it is possible to prevent the corrugation of the distance limiting means occurring in the direction parallel to the row of toner passage holes during the bonding operation, and it is possible to reduce the amount of material used in the fixing means for fixing the distance limiting means and the toner passage control means to each other, thereby reducing the cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the distance limiting means is in contact with the toner passage control means with a gap therebetween having a size less than or equal to a toner particle diameter, and the toner is prevented from intruding into the gap. With such a configuration, the adherence between the distance limiting means and the toner passage control means is improved, the intrusion of the toner into the interface therebetween is reduced, and the head interval can be stably and constantly maintained to be equal to the thickness of the distance limiting means itself for a long period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that: a thickness of the adhesive layer is less than or equal to a toner particle diameter; and the toner is prevented from intruding into an interface between the distance limiting means and the toner passage control means. With such a configuration, it is possible to prevent the toner from intruding into a portion other than the adhesion area along the interface between the distance limiting means and the toner passage control means to increase the head interval by the thickness of the intruding toner, thereby constantly maintaining the thickness of the distance limiting means itself to be equal to the interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> A toner passage control device of the present invention is a toner passage control device arranged so as to oppose a toner carrying position of a toner holder for holding a charged toner and moving while forming a toner layer, wherein: the toner passage control device includes, on an insulative member, a toner passage hole row including a plurality of toner passage holes for passing the toner therethrough arranged in a row in a direction perpendicular to a toner holder moving direction, and a control electrode provided along at least a portion of a periphery of each of the toner passage holes, wherein a voltage according to an image signal is applied to the control electrode so as to control passage of the toner through the toner passage holes; and spacer means which is in contact with the toner layer held on the toner holder for limiting a distance between the toner layer and an opening of the toner passage hole is provided integrally with the toner passage control device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Moreover, an image forming device of the present invention is an image forming device including the toner passage control device as described above, and a method for manufacturing a toner passage control device of the present invention is a method for manufacturing the toner passage control device as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the positional precision of the spacer means with respect to the toner passage hole can be improved, and it is possible to prevent variations in the flight characteristics of the toner which are caused by the variations in the head interval when the distance between the spacer means and the toner passage hole varies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Moreover, this eliminates the assembly operation of precisely attaching the spacer means having a thickness on the order of 10 &mgr;m or so to the toner passage control means so that the spacer means is not deformed. Thus, it is possible to eliminate the problem in the prior art that a very careful handling of the spacer means, which is a separate piece, is required, thereby increasing the number of assembly steps in mass production and increasing the cost due to frequent misoperation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the spacer means is formed by applying, and then curing, a thick film paste on the toner passage control means. Moreover, an image forming device of the present invention is an image forming device including the toner passage control device as described above, and a method for manufacturing a toner passage control device of the present invention is a method for manufacturing the toner passage control device as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, it is possible to easily form the spacer means having a thickness of about 10 &mgr;m on the toner passage control means. Moreover, the thickness can be further reduced, and it is then possible to reduce the head interval and to reduce the applied voltage to the control electrode that is required for allowing the toner to fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is preferred that the thick film paste is cured at a temperature of 220&deg; C. or less. Moreover, an image forming device of the present invention is an image forming device including the toner passage control device as described above, and a method for manufacturing a toner passage control device of the present invention is a method for manufacturing the toner passage control device as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> With this invention, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of a crease and corrugation in the toner passage control device due to heat contraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferred that the thick film paste is conductive. Moreover, an image forming device of the present invention is an image forming device including the toner passage control device as described above, and a method for manufacturing a toner passage control device of the present invention is a method for manufacturing the toner passage control device as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> With this invention, it is possible to prevent the toner from being excessively charged by the sliding movement between the surface of the spacer means and the toner layer, whereby it is possible to prevent the toner from electrostatically attaching to the spacer surface and to prevent such excessive charging from influencing the flight characteristics of the toner through the toner passage hole to cause the image density, the pixel forming position, etc., to vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the thick film paste is applied on the toner passage control means through a screen printing process. Moreover, an image forming device of the present invention is an image forming device including the toner passage control device as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, it is possible to easily form the spacer means having a thickness of about 10 &mgr;m on the toner passage control means, and the thickness can be further reduced. Moreover, it is then possible to reduce the head interval and to reduce the applied voltage to the control electrode that is required for allowing the toner to fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the positional precision of the spacer means with respect to the toner passage hole can be improved, and it is possible to prevent variations in the flight characteristics of the toner which are caused by the variations in the head interval when the distance between the spacer means and the toner passage hole varies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the case where the spacer means is formed only in a portion of the toner passage control means having a large surface area, as in the image forming device of the present invention, the material can be screen-printed only in portions where it is required, thus providing the effect of reducing the material cost and the depreciation cost of facilities, as compared to the case of using a thin film process in which the material is vapor-deposited across the entire area of the toner passage control means including portions that are masked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a surface of the spacer means is leveled during and after the screen printing process. Moreover, an image forming device of the present invention is an image forming device including the toner passage control device as described above, and a method for manufacturing a toner passage control device of the present invention is a method for manufacturing the toner passage control device as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> With this invention, depressions of the irregularities on the surface of the insulative film that have a height corresponding to the thickness of the control electrode are filled with a silver paste and are leveled, thereby making the surface of the spacer means flat. Thus, it is possible to prevent the irregularities on the surface of the insulative film from being expressed as irregularities on the surface of the spacer means, thereby causing irregularities on the toner layer that contacts the spacer means which are transferred onto the image to cause a minute density non-uniformity in the recorded image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a surface of the spacer means is coated with a metal film. Moreover, an image forming device of the present invention is an image forming device including the toner passage control device as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the spacer means has a good abrasion resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a surface roughness Rz of a portion of the spacer means that abuts on the toner layer on the toner holder is set to be 2 &mgr;m to 4 &mgr;m. Moreover, an image forming device of the present invention is an image forming device including the toner passage control device as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In this way, the adhesion force of the toner particle fused on the spacer surface is reduced so that the toner particle is easily removed by the sliding movement against the toner layer, thereby preventing the toner from gradually accumulating with the fused toner particle being a nucleus, and it is possible to prevent a streak or a density non-uniformity from occurring on the recorded image due to variations in the head interval in a long-term use of the image forming device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the toner passage control means is covered with an insulative film of silicon oxide or silicon nitride having a thickness of 3 &mgr;m or less that is deposited through chemical vapor deposition. Moreover, an image forming device of the present invention is an image forming device including the toner passage control device as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In this way, a sufficient degree of insulation and moisture resistance can be obtained with the insulative film having a thickness of about 2 &mgr;m, while the head interval can be reduced as compared to the thickness of 5 to 20 &mgr;m that is required in other methods, and the applied voltage to the control electrode that is required for allowing the toner to fly can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present invention provides, in an image forming device including a toner holder for holding a supplied toner and moving while forming a toner layer, and a back electrode arranged so as to oppose the toner holder for forming a transfer electric field for sucking the toner on the toner holder, a toner passage control device, including a plurality of toner passage holes arranged in a row in a direction that crosses a direction in which the toner holder moves, and a control electrode provided along a periphery of an opening of each of the toner passage holes, wherein the toner passage control device is arranged between the toner holder and the back electrode so as to control flight of the toner on the toner holder toward the back electrode. A spacer portion is provided on an upstream side and a downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the toner passage hole row, the spacer portion contacting the toner layer on the toner holder for forming and ensuring a constant gap between the toner layer and a toner entering side of each toner passage hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, the spacer portions, which are arranged on the upstream side and the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the row of toner passage holes of the toner passage control device, contact the toner layer on the toner holder, whereby the head interval, which is the spatial distance between the toner passage control device and the toner holder, can be maintained to be constant along the row of toner passage holes that is located between the two contact areas corresponding respectively to the spacer portion on the upstream side and the spacer portion on the downstream side. In this way, the head interval can be stably maintained even if the flexural rigidity of the toner passage control device changes due to the temperature, etc., and it is possible to prevent a decrease in the image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a ridge portion, on a toner passage hole row side, of the spacer portion that is on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction is formed to have an inclined cross section or a curved cross section that gradually approaches the toner layer on the toner holder in a direction toward the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In this way, when the toner layer on the toner holder enters the contact area where the downstream side spacer portion is contacted, the toner is prevented from being scratched off by the ridge portion of the spacer portion on the toner passage hole side. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate the problem of a so-called &ldquo;fogging phenomenon&rdquo; in which the toner, which has been scratched off the toner holder and has accumulated in the space between the toner passage control device and the toner holder, is ejected from the toner passage hole during a non-image forming period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that where the control electrode is arranged on a toner holder side surface, the spacer portion is formed by applying a thick film paste on a toner passage control device main body and curing the applied thick film paste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferred that the thick film paste is applied through a screen printing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, depressions of the irregularities on the surface of the toner passage control device on the toner holder side that have a height corresponding to the thickness of the control electrode are filled with a thick film paste and are leveled, whereby the surface of the spacer portion can be made flat despite the presence of the control electrode. In this way, it is possible to prevent a minute density non-uniformity in the recorded image from occurring due to the surface of the spacer portion becoming irregular to cause irregularities in the toner layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a thick film paste is typically dried and cured at a relatively low temperature after a screen printing process, whereby it is possible to reduce a crease or corrugation that occurs in the toner passage control device due to heat contraction when the spacer portions are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in devices such as the present image forming device in which the spacer portions are formed only in portions of the toner passage control device, which has a large area, the material can be screen-printed only in portions where it is required, thus reducing the material cost and the depreciation cost of facilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Moreover, even if the spacer portion has a very small thickness of about 10 &mgr;m, it can be easily formed on the toner passage control device. Moreover, the thickness can be further reduced, and it is then possible to further reduce the head interval and to reduce the applied voltage to the control electrode that is required for allowing the toner to fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the positional precision of the spacer portions with respect to the toner passage hole can be easily improved, and thus it is possible to prevent variations in the flight characteristics of the toner which are caused by the variations in the head interval due to variations in the distance between the toner passage hole and the spacer portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while it is necessary to precisely attach the spacer portions to the toner passage control device without deforming the spacer portions if the spacer portions are separate pieces as in the prior art, the spacer portions are formed integrally, thereby eliminating such an assembly operation and thus reducing the number of assembly steps in mass production and the occurrence of misoperation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the spacer portion on an upstream side in the toner holder moving direction and the spacer portion on a downstream side are provided so as to be continuous with each other on an outer side of each end, in a row direction, of the toner passage hole row, i.e., in a non-recording area of the toner passage control device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In this way, the toner passage control device can be continuously contacted to the toner layer even in a non-recording area of the toner passage control device, whereby it is possible to stably hold the toner passage control device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the spacer portion on an upstream side in the toner holder moving direction and the spacer portion on a downstream side have thicknesses different from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Such a configuration is advantageous in a case where a plurality of rows of toner passage holes are provided. Specifically, in the area between a contact area where the upstream spacer portion contacts the toner layer and a contact area where the downstream spacer portion contacts the toner layer, the head interval varies in the range equal to the difference between the thicknesses of the two spacer portions. Therefore, a head interval appropriate for each of the upstream and downstream rows of toner passage holes can be set by independently setting the thicknesses of the two spacer portions. For example, the amount of toner to be supplied typically decreases for a row of toner passage holes on the downstream side with respect to another row of toner passage holes on the upstream side, whereby it is possible to compensate for the decrease in the toner supply to obtain flight characteristics as those on the upstream side by setting the head interval for a row of toner passage holes on the downstream side to be smaller than that for another row of toner passage holes on the upstream side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that: a depressed portion is provided on a toner holder side surface; and the toner passage holes are arranged in the depressed portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In this way, the toner passage control device can be contacted to the toner layer on the toner holder both on the upstream side and the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the row of toner passage holes. For example, if the depressed portion has its bottom surface at a constant depth position, the head interval can be maintained to be equal to the depth dimension of the depressed portion. Thus, as in the invention described above, it is possible to prevent the problem that the head interval varies when the flexural rigidity of the toner passage control device changes due to the temperature, etc., and to prevent the toner flight characteristics from varying due to variations in the head interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the depressed portion is formed by heat-pressing the toner holder side surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In this way, the wall surface of the depressed portion on the downstream side can be formed in an optimal step shape by the shape of the die used for heat-pressing the toner passage control device in the formation of the depressed portion. Specifically, it is preferably a slope shape having a rounded ridge portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Moreover, even a step having a wall surface whose height is about 10 &mgr;m can be easily formed on the toner passage control device. The precision of such a step shape is determined by the precision of the die, whereby the variations in the head interval can be further reduced as compared to a case where the head interval is limited by the spacer portion formed through a screen printing process. Moreover, the thickness can be further reduced, and it is then possible to reduce the head interval and to reduce the applied voltage to the control electrode that is required for allowing the toner to fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that where the toner passage control device includes an insulative base member and the control electrode is arranged on a toner holder side surface of the insulative base member, the toner passage control device includes an adhesive layer which is provided on the same surface of the insulative base member as the control electrode and which can be deformed by being heat-pressed while the depressed portion is formed with heat, and a cover layer provided on the control electrode and the adhesive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferred that a surface of the cover layer is formed to be flush. Moreover, it is preferred that a thickness of the adhesive layer is smaller than a thickness of the control electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> With these arrangements, the depressions between the control electrodes on the insulative base member are absorbed as the depressions are filled with the softened adhesive layer during the heat pressing process, whereby the irregularities are prevented from being expressed on the surface of the toner passage control device. Thus, it is possible to prevent the problem that the irregularities formed by the control electrodes are expressed as irregularities on the surface of the cover layer, and irregularities are formed in the toner layer that contacts the irregular portions, which are then transferred onto the image, thereby causing a minute density non-uniformity in the recorded image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a ridge portion of the depressed portion that is on a downstream side in the toner holder moving direction is formed to have an inclined cross section or a curved cross section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferred that a wall surface of the depressed portion that is on a downstream side in the toner holder moving direction is formed to have an inclined cross section that gradually approaches the toner layer on the toner holder in a direction toward the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> With these arrangements, when the toner layer enters the contact area of the toner passage control device on the downstream side, the toner is prevented from being scratched off by the wall surface of the depressed portion on the downstream side or the ridge portion caused by the wall surface step. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate the problem of a so-called &ldquo;fogging phenomenon&rdquo; in which the toner, which has been scratched off the toner holder and has accumulated in the space between the toner passage control device and the toner holder, is ejected from the toner passage hole during a nonimage forming period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing the toner passage control device as described above, and with such a configuration, a toner passage control device according to the invention described above can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Particularly, it is preferred that when heat-pressing the toner passage control device main body, not only an area of the toner passage control device main body in which the depressed portion is to be formed is heat-pressed, but also a surrounding area is heat pressed simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> If only the area of the depressed portion is heat-pressed when heat-pressing the toner passage control device main body, a crease or corrugation is likely to occur in the surrounding area (e.g., the insulative base member or the cover layer), whereas if the heat pressing process is performed over an area including the surrounding area, it is possible not only to prevent such a crease or corrugation but also to improve the flatness of the surface of the surrounding area as compared to that before the heat pressing process.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Best modes for carrying out the present invention will be described below in the form of Examples with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> schematically illustrates an image forming device according to Example 1 of the present invention. In the figure, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a print head, and the print head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that is open on the upper side and has an opening in the bottom portion, a toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> arranged on the outer surface of a lower portion of the casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to cover the opening, and a toner supply unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> placed in the casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is arranged below the print head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with an appropriate gap therebetween, and an image receiving member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> such as recording paper is passed through between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the print head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> The toner supply unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes a storage container <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for storing a toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is a developer, a toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arranged so as to meet an opening that is formed in a lower portion of the storage container <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a limiting blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for limiting a toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>a held and carried by the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a supply roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for stirring and frictionally charging the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the storage container <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> while supplying the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the toner supply unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inserted into the casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> vertically and downwardly in the figure and is set at a predetermined position in the casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed in a generally cylindrical shape by using a metal such as aluminum or iron or an alloy, and rotates in the counterclockwise direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> about the central axis thereof (moves from left to right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), thereby carrying the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the toner carrying position in the lower portion (a position opposing a toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be described later). In the present example, the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a rotatable sleeve made of aluminum having an outer diameter of <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> mm and a thickness of 1 mm, and the potential thereof is the ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> The limiting blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made of an elastic member such as a urethane, and suitably has a hardness of 40 to 80 degrees (JIS K6301 A Scale), a free end length (the length of a portion thereof extending from the position where it is attached) of 5 to 15 mm, and a linear load on the toner holder 10 of 5 to 40 N/m. One to three toner layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the limiting blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Note that in the present example, the limiting blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is electrically floating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> The toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is interposed between the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the limiting blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, where it is subject to slight stirring and is charged by receiving a charge from the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the present example, the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a non-magnetic material having an average particle diameter of 6 &mgr;m, and has a negative charge of &minus;10 &mgr;C/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> The supply roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is obtained by providing a synthetic rubber such as a urethane foam having a thickness of about 2 to 6 mm on a shaft made of a metal such as iron (having a diameter of 8 mm in the present example), so that the hardness thereof is 30 degrees (as measured by the method of JIS K6301 A Scale using a sample that has been processed into a roller shape). In addition to assisting in charging the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it controls the supply of the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The amount by which the supply roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is pushed into the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably about 0.1 to 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> The toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes, as a base member, a flexible insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 50 &mgr;m and an effective width that corresponds to the effective width of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is provided with a large number of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> arranged at a minute pitch in the width direction of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (the direction of the central axis of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>: the direction perpendicular to the sheet of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), whereby one or more rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed, each row including the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> arranged in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves. A ring-shaped control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) is formed on the upper surface of the insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> along the entire periphery (or a portion thereof) of each of the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to surround the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) are formed on the lower surface of the insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a material such as polyimide or polyethylene terephthalate, and suitably has a thickness of 10 to 100 &mgr;m. In the present example, polyimide having a thickness of 50 &mgr;m is used as the insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrate, on an enlarged scale, a portion of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> around the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As described above, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided in the insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> thereof and arranged in a row at a predetermined pitch in the central axis direction of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves). In the present example, the pitch of the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is 125 &mgr;m, corresponding to 200 dpi, for a recording resolution of 600 dpi. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is arranged on the upper surface of the insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so as to surround the periphery of each toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a tip portion of a wire portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending from the control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is connected to an IC chip (not shown) for applying an image signal to the control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the pair of deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged on the lower surface of the insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so as to surround the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from opposite sides. As the control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are also provided with wire portions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, respectively, that are connected to the IC chip. The electrodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are made of a Cu film having a thickness of about 8 to 20 &mgr;m, which is patterned on the insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is coated with an insulative film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of 5 to 30 &mgr;m so as to prevent these electrodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from being shorted with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> While the shape of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a circular shape in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it may alternatively be another shape such as an oblong circle shape or an elliptical shape, and the size thereof is set so that the diameter is about 70 to 120 &mgr;m. Note that a voltage of 400 V or less is normally applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for forming dots. In the present example, a voltage of 250 V is applied for forming dots and a voltage of &minus;50 V for not forming dots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is attached and fixed to the casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by a screw <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, as attachment means, at an end portion thereof that is on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves with respect to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (an end portion opposite to the side to which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves: &ldquo;moving direction rear end portion&rdquo;), and an end portion that is on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves (an end portion on the side to which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves: &ldquo;moving direction front end portion&rdquo;) is wound around a stay portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(a bent portion) that is formed in the casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and having a curvature smaller than that of the outer perimeter of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is bent along the stay portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and then attached to an attachment portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> protruding from the casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a tension spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (of course, the attachment positions of the opposite end portions of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be reversed from those described above). The contact pressure between the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> contact each other via a spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as will be described later) is suitably 2 to 20 kPa. This is because the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> need to be always in contact with each other under the same condition, following the eccentricity of the rotation axis of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in order to maintain the interval between the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the position of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be substantially constant, and an excessive contact pressure deforms the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Note that the contact pressure slightly varies depending on the material of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a spacer member that is bonded and fixed to the surface (upper surface) of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that opposes the toner holder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contacts the surface of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a contact area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, whereby the interval (head interval) between the surface of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the opening, on the side of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is maintained at a constant interval that is substantially the same as the thickness of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> itself. Thus, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is provided between the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at a position that is on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves with respect to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, with one of the surfaces in the thickness direction (the upper surface) thereof contacting the surface of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the other surface (the lower surface) thereof contacting the upper surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably 5 to 150 &mgr;m, more preferably 5 to 20 &mgr;m, and it is set to be 10 &mgr;m in the present example. Moreover, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is made so that irregularities on the surface (the upper surface) of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that is in contact with the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are not transferred onto the surface of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or do not influence the smoothness of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is made of a steel strip or a conductive resin sheet, and is electrically grounded. In a case where a steel strip is used, it is preferably a stainless steel strip for springs (e.g., SUS 301-CSP), a carbon tool steel material (SK), a cold rolled steel strip for springs (e.g., SK4-CSP), a cold rolled stainless steel strip (e.g., SUS301), or the like, and it is preferred that the hardness Hv of the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is 400 to 600. On the other hand, in a case where a conductive resin is used, it is preferred to use a PET or polyimide sheet, as a base sheet, which is subjected to a surface treatment using an antistatic material. The surface treatment using an antistatic material is preferably performed by coating the surface with a boron-based antistatic polymer, and the coating thickness is preferably 5 to 10 &mgr;m. Moreover, the surface resistance value of the antistatic material is preferably 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr; (&OHgr;/&square;) or less, and more preferably 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;. Note that a sheet made of a stainless steel strip for springs (SUS 301-CSP-H) and having a thickness of 10 &mgr;m is used in the present example. A stainless steel strip is used in order to prevent corrosion, and a spring steel with a tempering symbol &ldquo;H&rdquo; is used in order to obtain a hardness Hv of <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> The surface roughness Rz (ten-point average roughness based on JIS B0601 with a reference length of 0.8 mm) of the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that contacts the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (the upper surface: &ldquo;toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>contact surface&rdquo;) is preferably smaller than the average particle diameter of the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to 8 &mgr;m. Particularly, the surface roughness Rz in an area of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is 5 mm in length from one end thereof on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves toward the upstream side is preferably set to be smaller than the average particle diameter of the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that the smoothness of the surface of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>does not vary through the contact of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Specifically, it is preferably 2 to 4 &mgr;m. Moreover, in an area of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is 1 mm in length from one end thereof on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves toward the upstream side, it is preferred that the protrusion height with respect to the surface roughness average line is set to be 4 &mgr;m or less. In the present example, the surface roughness Rz of the entire spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is set to be 6.3 Z (6.3 &mgr;m or less), the surface roughness Rz is 3.2 Z (3.2 &mgr;m or less) in an area of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is 5 mm in length from one end thereof on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves toward the upstream side, and there is no protrusion having a height exceeding 4 &mgr;m with respect to the surface roughness average line, in the area of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is 1 mm in length from one end thereof on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves toward the upstream side. Moreover, a corner portion of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> between the upper surface thereof and the end surface on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves is rounded off through a chamfer process (e.g., an R-chamfer process) of a size equal to or greater than &frac12; of the thickness of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> The adhesive layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is preferably a resin-based or rubber-based adhesive or a double-sided adhesive tape.

<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> When the toner supply unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is attached to the casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, with the distance between the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> being maintained at a predetermined dimension, the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in contact with the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is wound around the outer perimeter of the bent portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and then elastically held by the casing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the tension spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that is suspended at the end on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves. In such a state, the tension spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is displaced, resisting against the pressing force from the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is slightly displaced downward as indicated by a two-dot chain line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Thus, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, across the entire width thereof, is in close contact with the surface of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The interval (head interval) between the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the opening, on the side of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is precisely maintained by the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at a value in the range of 0 to 200 &mgr;m, and 10 &mgr;m in the present example. The tension on the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a value that is appropriately set so as to obtain an appropriate contact pressure (2 to 20 kPa) between the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as described above, and is relatively small for the rigidity of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> itself </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> The present example employs a configuration in which the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is contacted with the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as described above, whereby even if the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has outer diameter variations, a cylindricity non-uniformity, a radial runout, etc., the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> moves in the vertical direction along the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, whereby such variations can be absorbed. In this way, the head interval at the position of the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is maintained at a constant value that is substantially the same as the thickness of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the recording characteristics from varying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is arranged so as to oppose the toner carrying position of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> being interposed between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is obtained by dispersing a conductive filler in a metal or a resin. A voltage for forming, between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a transfer electrostatic field that sucks the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is applied to the counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Specifically, a DC voltage of about 500 to 2000 V is applied, and a voltage of 1000 V is applied in the present example. Moreover, the distance between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably 150 to 1000 m, and is set to be 350 &mgr;m in the present example. The image receiving member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> such as recording paper is placed between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the print head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the image receiving member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is passed through therebetween by being carried in the direction of arrow &ldquo;a&rdquo; along a predetermined path extending between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> An image forming operation with such a configuration will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. First, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>held by the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is allowed to fly by applying a voltage of 250 V to the control electrode 15 with &plus;150 V being applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and &minus;150 V being applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the negatively charged toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is deflected to the left. Then, the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pulled by the electric field formed by the counter electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to pass through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and flies while being deflected to the left so as to attach to the image receiving member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by about 40 &mgr;m to the left from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Then, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as described above with the left and right deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being brought to 0 V, whereby the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> flies straight along the axis direction of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> without being deflected so as to attach to the image receiving member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Next, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as described above with &minus;150 V being applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and &plus;150 V being applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the negatively charged toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is deflected to the right, whereby the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> flies while being deflected to the right so as to attach to the image receiving member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by about 40 &mgr;m to the right from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this way, the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be made to attach to three points, i e., the left, right and center points, with a single toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, by successively changing the voltages applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Note that during a non-image forming period, the voltage applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is set to be &minus;50 V so that the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> does not fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the example above, a sheet made of a stainless steel strip for springs and having a thickness of 10 &mgr;m is used, irregularities on the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (as a contact member contacting one of the surfaces of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the thickness direction thereof that is opposite to the surface contacting the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) will not influence the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the irregularities will not be transferred onto the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to cause an image non-uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Specifically, as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes, on the insulative member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the electrodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that are formed by patterning a Cu film having a thickness of about 8 to 20 &mgr;m, and the surface thereof is coated with the insulative film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of 5 to 30 &mgr;m for preventing these electrodes from being shorted with one another, with the insulative film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being coated on the surface of the electrodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with a constant thickness. Therefore, irregularities having a height of 8 to 20 &mgr;m which are caused by the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> appear on the upper surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the pitch of the control electrodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, i.e., 125 &mgr;m. On the other hand, as described above, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is pressed against the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a contact pressure of 2 to 20 kPa via the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. If the upper surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having irregularities as described above is pressed with such a pressure uniformly against the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may bent and deformed along the irregularities. In the example above, however, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is made of a stainless steel strip for springs, whereby it does not undergo the bending deformation along the irregularities on the upper surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and has a sufficient flexural rigidity so as not to transfer the irregularities to the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As a result, the upper surface precision of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is not influenced by the irregularities on the upper surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the irregularities are prevented from being transferred onto the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with which the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contacts to cause an image non-uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the portion of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that directly contacts the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, i.e., in the area of the upper surface of the spacer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is 5 mm in length from one end thereof on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves toward the upstream side, the surface roughness Rz is set to be 3.2 Z, whereby the height of the irregularities between top and bottom portions in that area is 3.2 &mgr;m at maximum. On the other hand, the average particle diameter of the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is 6 &mgr;m, as described above. Therefore, assuming that the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a uniform thickness is ideally formed only with particles of the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having a particle diameter of 6 &mgr;m, the surface roughness Rz of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is calculated to be 6&times;sin45&deg;, i.e., 4.2 &mgr;m. As a result, the surface roughness in that area is set to be smaller than the surface roughness of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed with a uniform thickness, whereby the surface roughness of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>does not increase when the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contacts the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thus, the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>contacted by the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is prevented from being scratched by minute irregularities or protrusions on the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and such minute irregularities or protrusions are prevented from being transferred onto the image to cause a minute streak in the recorded image. Herein, the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in fact has a particle diameter distribution, and the content of the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having a smaller particle diameter than the average particle diameter, e.g., the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having a particle diameter of 5 &mgr;m or less, is about 20 to 30%. On the other hand, the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having a large particle diameter of 11 &mgr;m or more is contained at about the same proportion. Therefore, it is assumed that if the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having a large particle diameter and the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having a small particle diameter are distributed substantially equally, the surface roughness Rz of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is the same as the value above calculated from the average particle diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the example above, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is substantially parallel to the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the contact area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the end of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves is located on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves with respect to the contact area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Moreover, in the area of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is 1 mm in length from one end thereof on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves toward the upstream side, there is no protrusion whose height does not exceed 4 &mgr;m with respect to the surface roughness average line. Moreover, a corner portion of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> between the upper surface thereof and the end surface on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves is chamfered by a size equal to or greater than &frac12; of the thickness of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this way, the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>a smoothly enters the contact area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contacts the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>over a large area in the contact area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while an edge portion (end) on the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves does not directly abut on the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Therefore, even if there are minute irregularities on the surface of the edge portion, the stress applied on the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not localized in the edge portion. As a result, the irregularities in the edge portion are prevented from being transferred onto the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby preventing a scratch in the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an image non-uniformity from occurring. Moreover, this eliminates the problem that a sufficient image density cannot be obtained due to a reduced thickness of the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the example above, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is electrically grounded, and the surface roughness Rz of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is limited in the predetermined area as described above, whereby it is possible to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from attaching to the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a long-term use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Specifically, when a recording operation is performed continuously over a long period of time with the surface roughness Rz of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> being set to be about 12.5 Z (12.5 &mgr;m or less), the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is accidentally fused on the portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is in contact with the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> gradually accumulates with the fused toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being a nucleus. The portion of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on which the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fused forms a protrusion, whereby a streak-like scratch is formed on the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is regulated in a layer by the limiting blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, at a position opposing the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thus transferring a streak running in the secondary scanning direction (the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves) onto the image formed on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the portion where the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fused acts as a local resistance in the sliding movement against the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, whereby even more toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fused and the protrusion on the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> grows, thus gradually enlarging the streak on the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> If the recording operation is further continued over a long period of time, the number of such protrusions gradually increases while the size of each protrusion also increases, finally resulting in a state where the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fused and accumulated in a planar shape over a certain area, though such an area is partial. If the amount of toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> accumulated varies in the direction parallel to the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (the primary scanning direction), it will not only scratch the surface of the opposing toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, but also cause variations in the interval (head interval) between the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the primary scanning direction, thereby causing variations in the recording characteristics, which in turn cause a strip-shaped density nonuniformity parallel to the secondary scanning direction in the recorded image formed on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, no contact pressure is applied on a portion of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is in the vicinity of the contact area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves with respect to the contact area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>because the portion is spaced apart from the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a recording operation. However, if the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is accidentally fused on the portion, it in many cases remains unremoved on the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> even if the adhesion force thereof is small. Then, the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> further accumulates with the fused toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being a nucleus, and when the tip thereof contacts the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, it scratches the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby causing an image non-uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent such a problem from occurring, the example above employs the configuration as described above. Specifically, first, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is electrically grounded, thereby preventing the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from being newly charged by the sliding movement between the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>a, and thus preventing the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from electrostatically attaching to the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the surface roughness of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is set to be 3.2 Z in the contact area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby reducing the holding force of the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> fused on the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the fused toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is easily removed by the sliding movement between the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby preventing the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from gradually accumulating with the fused toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being a nucleus. Moreover, in a portion of the upper surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> other than the contact area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, no contact pressure is applied, whereby the adhesion force of the fused toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is small, and thus the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is removed even with a surface roughness of about 6.3 Z., thus preventing the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from gradually accumulating with the fused toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being a nucleus. Therefore, the toner <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will not accumulate on the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a long-term use, whereby it is possible to prevent a streak on the recorded image due to a scratch in the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the example above, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> employs a stainless steel strip for springs with a tempering symbol &ldquo;H&rdquo; (SUS 301-CSP-H), whereby it is possible to obtain a hardness Hv of 430. Therefore, when the thin spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (thickness: 10 &mgr;m) is bonded on the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is prevented from being plastically deformed to lower its smoothness due to a misoperation, etc. As a result, it is possible to prevent problems such as a scratch in the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or an image non-uniformity. Moreover, the work efficiency of the assembly operation can be significantly improved. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from wearing off by the sliding movement between the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Note that while the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a sheet made of a stainless steel strip for springs and having a thickness of 10 &mgr;m in the example above, a sheet made of a conductive resin may alternatively be used as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are separate, individual components in the example above. Alternatively, the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be integrated together with the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> being formed on the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a portion of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the opening of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may directly contact the toner layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>without the upper surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> being partially raised (where the portion of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the opening of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> forms the spacer member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). It is needless to say that, in either case, the present invention can be easily carried out, and functions/effects as those of the example above can be obtained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> The toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed in a generally cylindrical shape by using a metal such as aluminum or iron or an alloy, and rotates in the counterclockwise direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> about the central axis thereof (moves from left to right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), thereby carrying the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the toner carrying position in the lower portion (a position opposing a toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to be described later). In the present example, the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is a rotatable sleeve made of aluminum having an outer diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 1 mm, and the potential thereof is the ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> The limiting blade <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is made of an elastic member such as a urethane, and suitably has a hardness of 40 to 80 degrees (JIS K6301 A Scale), a free end length (the length of a portion thereof extending from the position where it is attached) of 5 to 15 mm, and a linear load on the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of 5 to 40 N/m. One to three toner layers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>are formed on the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by the limiting blade <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> The toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is interposed between the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the limiting blade <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, where it is subject to slight stirring and is charged by receiving a charge from the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In the present example, the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is a non-magnetic material having an average particle diameter of 8 &mgr;m, and has a negative charge of &minus;10 &mgr;C/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> The supply roller <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is obtained by providing a synthetic rubber such as a urethane foam having a thickness of about 2 to 6 mm on a shaft made of a metal such as iron (having a diameter of 8 mm in the present example), so that the hardness thereof is 30 degrees (as measured by the method of JIS K6301 A Scale using a sample that has been processed into a roller shape). In addition to assisting in charging the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, it controls the supply of the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The amount by which the supply roller <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is pushed into the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably about 0.1 to 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes, as a base member, a flexible insulative member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 50 &mgr;m and an effective width that corresponds to the effective width of the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The insulative member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is provided with a large number of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> arranged at a minute pitch in the width direction of the image receiving member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (the direction of the central axis of the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>: the direction perpendicular to the sheet of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), whereby one or more rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are formed, each row including the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> arranged in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves.

<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is attached and fixed to the casing member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by a screw <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, as attachment means, at an end portion thereof that is on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves with respect to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (an end portion opposite to the side to which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves: &ldquo;moving direction rear end portion&rdquo;), and an end portion that is on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves (an end portion on the side to which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves: &ldquo;moving direction front end portion&rdquo;) is attached to an attachment portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> protruding from the casing member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via a tension spring <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (of course, the attachment positions of the opposite end portions of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be reversed from those described above). A portion of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> between the end portion on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves and the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is wound around a stay portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(a bent portion) that is formed in the casing member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and having a curvature smaller than that of the outer perimeter of the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and is bent along the stay portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The contact pressure between the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> contact each other via a spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> as will be described later) is suitably 2 to 20 kPa. This is because the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> need to be always in contact with each other under the same condition, following the eccentricity of the rotation axis of the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, in order to maintain the interval between the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at the position of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to be substantially constant, and an excessive contact pressure deforms the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Note that the contact pressure slightly varies depending on the material of the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is a spacer member that is formed on the surface (upper surface) of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that opposes the toner holder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> The spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> will be described in greater detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is a spacer film that is obtained by forming a film made of an insulative material on the insulative member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> or the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> through vapor deposition by a thin film process such as sputtering or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The thickness of the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is preferably 5 to 150 &mgr;m, more preferably 5 to 20 &mgr;m, and it is set to be 10 &mgr;m in the present example. The vapor deposition of the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is performed with a uniform thickness on the insulative member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> or the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, whereby the surface (upper surface) of the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> includes irregularities running in the primary scanning direction (the direction parallel to the rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) and having a height that corresponds to the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> The material of the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is preferably a polyparaxylene resin (parylene), and in the present example, it is formed through a coating process by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Specifically, the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is formed by chemical vapor deposition after masking, in advance, portions where the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is not to be formed, e.g., portions that are to be the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> While the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is coated with an insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of 5 to 30 &mgr;m so as to prevent the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from being shorted with one another, as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> serves also as a protection layer covering the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The material of the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> may be the same as, or different from, that of the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. In the present example, it is formed through a coating process by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using a polyparaxylene resin (parylene). By covering the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> with the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> formed through a coating process, the ridge portion of the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> at each end in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves (the corner portion in the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> between the toner layer contact surface and the end portion on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves) has a shape with a small curved surface portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the end portion on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves on the surface (upper surface) of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is in contact with the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is inclined away from the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the direction toward the upstream side. Note that since the coating process of the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is also performed with a uniform thickness, the surface of the portion of the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> corresponding to the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (i.e., the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>) also has irregularities running in the primary scanning direction and having a height that corresponds to the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is subjected to a surface treatment using an antistatic material and electrically grounded. The surface treatment using an antistatic material is preferably performed by coating the surface with a boron-based antistatic polymer, and the coating thickness is preferably 5 to 10 &mgr;m. Moreover, the surface resistance value of the antistatic material is preferably 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr; (&OHgr;/&square;) or less, and more preferably 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> When the toner supply unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is attached to the casing member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, with the distance between the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the counter electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> being maintained at a predetermined dimension, the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is in contact with the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is wound around the outer perimeter of the bent portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the casing member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and then elastically held by the casing member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via the tension spring <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> that is suspended at the end on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves. In such a state, the tension spring <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is displaced, resisting against the pressing force from the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Thus, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, across the entire width thereof, is in close contact with the surface of the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The interval (head interval) between the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the opening, on the side of the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is precisely maintained by the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at a value in the range of 0 to 200 &mgr;m, and 10 &mgr;m in the present example. The tension on the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is a value that is appropriately set so as to obtain an appropriate contact pressure (2 to 20 kPa) between the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as described above, and is relatively small for the rigidity of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> itself </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> The present example employs a configuration in which the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is contacted with the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, as described above, whereby even if the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has outer diameter variations, a cylindricity non-uniformity, a radial runout, etc., the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> moves in the vertical direction along the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, whereby such variations can be absorbed. In this way, the head interval at the position of the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is maintained at a constant value that is substantially the same as the thickness of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the recording characteristics from varying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The counter electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is arranged so as to oppose the toner carrying position of the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> being interposed between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the counter electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is obtained by dispersing a conductive filler in a metal or a resin. A voltage for forming, between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a transfer electrostatic field that sucks the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is applied to the counter electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Specifically, a DC voltage of about 500 to 2000 V is applied, and a voltage of 1000 V is applied in the present example. Moreover, the distance between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably 150 to 1000 &mgr;m, and is set to be 350 &mgr;m in the present example. The image receiving member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> such as recording paper is placed between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the print head <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and the image receiving member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is passed through therebetween by being carried in the direction of arrow &ldquo;a&rdquo; along a predetermined path extending between the counter electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> An image forming operation with such a configuration will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. First, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>held by the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is allowed to fly by applying a voltage of 250 V to the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> with &plus;150 V being applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and &minus;150 V being applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the negatively charged toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is deflected to the left. Then, the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is pulled by the electric field formed by the counter electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to pass through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and flies while being deflected to the left so as to attach to the image receiving member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by about 40 &mgr;m to the left from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Then, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> as described above with the left and right deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being brought to 0 V, whereby the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> flies straight along the axis direction of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> without being deflected so as to attach to the image receiving member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> at the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> Next, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> as described above with &minus;150 V being applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and &plus;150 V being applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the negatively charged toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is deflected to the right, whereby the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> flies while being deflected to the right so as to attach to the image receiving member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by about 40 &mgr;m to the right from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In this way, the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> can be made to attach to three points, i.e., the left, right and center points, with a single toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, by successively changing the voltages applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Note that during a non-image forming period, the voltage applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is set to be &minus;50 V so that the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> does not fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the example above, the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is provided on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves with respect to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> so that on the upstream side, the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is regulated in a layer by the limiting blade <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, is supplied directly to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> without contacting anything. Therefore, even if there are minute irregularities or protrusions on the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is in contact with the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby scratching the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in contact with the irregularities or protrusions, the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has already supplied the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is scratched after passing the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not scratched at the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>), whereby a disturbance in the toner layer due to such a scratch is prevented from being transferred onto the recorded image to cause a minute streak in the recorded image. Moreover, the scratch occurring in the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>after it passes the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is further moved along with the rotation of the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and is recovered to the original state by the supply roller <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> or the limiting blade <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> so that it will not influence the subsequent recording operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Thus, very stringent requirements in the surface roughness or flatness are not imposed on the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, thereby reducing the component cost. Moreover, the manufacturing step of forming the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> does not require a very careful operation for the formation and handling of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, thereby reducing the number of assembly steps in mass production, and reducing the frequency of occurrence of a misoperation or a defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when a recording operation is performed continuously over a long period of time, toner particles may accidentally attach to the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is in contact with the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> gradually accumulates with an attached toner particle being a nucleus, thereby forming a protrusion in an area of the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is in contact with the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>where the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has been fused. Even in such a case, since the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>scratched by such a protrusion has already supplied the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, as described above, the disturbance in the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>due to the protrusion is prevented from being transferred onto the recorded image to cause a minute streak in the recorded image. As a result, it is possible to prevent the reliability from lowering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the example above includes the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, wherein the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is obtained by forming a film made of an insulative material on the insulative member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> or the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through vapor deposition by a thin film process such as sputtering or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), after which it is coated with the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), or the like. Therefore, the ridge portion of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at each end in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves (particularly at the end on the upstream side) has a shape with the curved surface portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Thus, the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is prevented from being scratched off by the ridge portion of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> when the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>enters the area of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and thus the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, which has been scratched off, will not accumulate in the space between the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, whereby it is possible to suppress a so-called &ldquo;fogging phenomenon&rdquo; in which the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is ejected from the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> during a non-image forming period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by forming the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> through vapor deposition, the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, which is as thin as about 10 &mgr;m, can be easily and stably formed, as compared to a method in which a metal sheet, or the like, which has been cut to a predetermined size is attached to the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in a method in which the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 10 &mgr;m to which flatness, etc., is required is attached to the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is easily deformed in the assembly operation. However, there is no such problem, and it is possible to further reduce the number of assembly steps in mass production and to further reduce the frequency of occurrence of a misoperation or a defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the vapor deposition of the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is performed with a uniform thickness on the insulative member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> or the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, whereby the surface of the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> includes irregularities running in the primary scanning direction and having a height that corresponds to the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Similarly, since the coating process of the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is also performed with a uniform thickness, the surface of the portion of the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> corresponding to the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> also has irregularities running in the primary scanning direction and having a height that corresponds to the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. However, with which the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is to contact is the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that has already supplied the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, as described above, whereby a disturbance in the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>occurring due to the contact with the irregularities will not be transferred onto the recorded image to cause a minute streak in the recorded image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Specifically, when the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is formed through vapor deposition, or the like, there is a problem that the irregularities of an underlying layer, e.g., an electrode, appear on the surface thereof However, such a problem can be eliminated by arranging the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves with respect to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the example above, the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is subjected to a surface treatment using an antistatic material made of a boron-based antistatic polymer, and is electrically grounded, thereby preventing the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> from being excessively charged by the sliding movement between the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and preventing the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> from electrostatically attaching to the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Moreover, even if excessive charging occurs, what is newly charged by the sliding movement against the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which has already supplied the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and it will not influence the flight characteristics of the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to cause the image density, the pixel forming position, etc., to vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the level of antistatic performance required for the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may be low as long as it is possible to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> from electrostatically attaching to the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and may be lower than that in a case where the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is contacted with the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves with respect to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Thus, the surface resistance value may be about 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the example above, the surface roughness Rz of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is set to be 6.3 Z, whereby it is possible to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> from attaching to the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in a long-term use. In a case where the surface roughness of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is about 12.5 Z, if a recording operation is performed continuously over a long period of time, the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is accidentally fused on the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and gradually accumulates with the fused toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> being a nucleus, whereby the portion of the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> on which the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is fused forms a protrusion. Moreover, if the recording operation is further continued over a long period of time, the number of such protrusions gradually increases while the size of each protrusion also increases, finally resulting in a state where the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is fused and accumulated in a planar shape over a certain area, though such an area is partial. If the amount of toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> accumulated varies in the direction parallel to the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (the primary scanning direction), it will cause variations in the interval (head interval) between the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the primary scanning direction, thereby causing variations in the recording characteristics, which in turn cause a strip-shaped density non-uniformity parallel to the secondary scanning direction in the recorded image formed on the image receiving member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> In contrast, by setting the surface roughness Rz of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to be about 6.3 Z, the adhesion force of the fused toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is reduced so that the fused toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is easily removed by the sliding movement against the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby preventing the toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> from gradually accumulating with the fused toner <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> being a nucleus. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a density non-uniformity on the recorded image from occurring due to variations in the head interval in a long-term use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Note that while the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are integrated together in the example above, the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be separate and individual members that are attached to each other. Alternatively, a portion of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the opening of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may directly contact the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>without the upper surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> being partially raised (where the portion of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the opening of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> forms the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>). Also in such cases, the present invention can be carried out, and functions/effects as those of the example above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is formed by covering the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> on the insulative member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> with the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> may alternatively be formed through vapor deposition, or the like, on the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In such a case, by selecting a conductive material for the spacer film <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, the surface treatment using an antistatic material can be omitted, whereby it is possible to reduce the cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the end portion on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves on the surface of the spacer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is in contact with the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is inclined by the curved surface portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>away from the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the direction toward the upstream side. Alternatively, it may be inclined by providing a flat surface portion (slope portion) away from the toner layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the direction toward the upstream side. </paragraph>

As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the toner supply unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is inserted into the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> horizontally from right to left in the figure and is set at a predetermined position in the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> The toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is formed by using a metal such as aluminum or iron or an alloy. In the present example, the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is a rotatable sleeve made of aluminum having an outer diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 1 mm, and the potential thereof is the ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> The limiting blade <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is made of an elastic member such as a urethane, and suitably has a hardness of 40 to 80 degrees (JIS K6301 A Scale), a free end length (the length of a portion thereof extending from the position where it is attached) of 5 to 15 mm, and a linear load on the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of 5 to 40 g/cm, for forming one to three layers of toner <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> on the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The limiting blade <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is electrically floating in the present example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The toner <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is interposed between the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the limiting blade <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, where it is subject to slight stirring and is charged by receiving a charge from the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In the present example, the toner <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is a non-magnetic material having an average particle diameter of 8 &mgr;m, and has a negative charge of &minus;10 &mgr;C/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> The supply roller <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is obtained by providing a synthetic rubber such as a urethane foam having a thickness of about 2 to 6 mm on a shaft made of a metal such as iron (having a diameter of 8 mm in the present example), so that the hardness thereof is 30 degrees (as measured by the method of JIS K6301 A Scale using a sample that has been processed into a roller shape). In addition to assisting in charging the toner <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, it controls the supply thereof The amount by which it is pushed into the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is preferably about 0.1 to 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is toner passage control means including a flexible insulative base member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> having an effective width that corresponds to the effective width of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The insulative base member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is provided with a large number of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> arranged at a minute pitch in the width direction of the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, whereby one or more rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are formed. A ring-shaped control electrode (not shown) is formed so as to surround each toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, and deflection electrodes (not shown) are formed on the lower surface of the insulative base member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The insulative base member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a material such as polyimide or polyethylene terephthalate, and suitably has a thickness of 10 to 100 &mgr;m. In the present example, polyimide having a thickness of 50 &mgr;m is used as the insulative base member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is an enlarged view illustrating an electrode portion of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is arranged in parallel to the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, as described above. Moreover, a control electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is arranged on the upper surface of the insulative substrate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> i m so as to surround the periphery of each toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, and an IC chip (not shown) for applying an image signal is connected to a lead electrode extending from the control electrode. A pair of deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged on the lower surface of the insulative substrate <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> so as to surround the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> from opposite sides.

The surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is coated with an insulative film <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of 5 to 30 &mgr;m so as to prevent these electrodes from being shorted with one another. While the shape of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is a circular shape in the figure, it may alternatively be another shape such as an oblong circle shape or an elliptical shape. The size thereof is set so that the diameter is about 70 to 120 &mgr;m. Note that a voltage of 400 V or less is normally applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, and in the present example, a voltage of 250 V is applied for forming dots and a voltage of &minus;50 V for not forming dots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> The toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is fixed to the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> by attachment means <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> at a position on the upstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the point where it contacts the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and it is fixed via attachment means <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and a tension spring <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> on the downstream side. Of course, the upstream side and the downstream side may be reversed. The contact pressure between the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is suitably 0.2 to 2 gf/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. This is because the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> need to be always in contact with each other under the same condition, following the eccentricity of the rotation axis of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, in order to maintain the interval between the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> at the position of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to be always constant, and because it is necessary to ensure that the toner layer on the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is not deformed by an excessive contact pressure. The contact pressure slightly varies depending on the material of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is a spacer that is bonded and fixed by an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> on the surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> opposing the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and the spacer <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> contacts the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in a contact area <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby limiting the interval (head interval) between the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to the thickness of the spacer <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> itself. The spacer <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is a sheet made of a metal or a conductive resin, and the thickness thereof is preferably 5 to 150 &mgr;m, and more preferably 5 to 20 &mgr;m. Moreover, the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> is preferably a resin-based or rubber-based adhesive or a double-sided adhesive tape, and the thickness thereof is preferably 2 to 120 &mgr;m, and more preferably 2 to 5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> When the toner supply unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is attached to the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, with the distance between the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the back electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> being limited to a predetermined dimension, the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> abuts on the spacer <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is located at the left end of the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, wound around the outer perimeter of a bent portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which has a curvature smaller than that of the outer perimeter of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and then elastically held by the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> via the tension spring <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> that is suspended at the end on the downstream side. In such a state, the tension spring <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is displaced, resisting against the pressing force from the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to the spacer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. Thus, the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, across the entire width thereof, is in close contact with the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> via the spacer <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The distance (head interval) between the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is precisely maintained by the spacer <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> at a value in the range of 0 to 200 &mgr;m, and 10 &mgr;m in the present example. The tension on the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is a value that is appropriately set so as to obtain an appropriate contact pressure (0.2 to 2 gf/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) between the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> as described above, and is relatively small for the rigidity of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> itself </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is flat in a separated state where no tension is being applied by the tension spring <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. However, when it is attached to the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, it is wound around the bent portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, as described above, whereby the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has a curvature equal to that of the bent portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which has a curvature that is smaller than that of the outer perimeter of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, in an area <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(hereinafter &ldquo;winding area&rdquo;) where the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is in contact with the bent portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> When the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is attached to the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a tension is applied on the tension spring <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, the curvature of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in the spaced-apart area <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is slightly reduced from that in a separated state where no tension is applied thereon. However, the tension applied on the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is relatively small for the rigidity of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> itself, as described above. Therefore, even with a tension being applied on the tension spring <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is attached to the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> while it has the continuously changing curvature in the same direction as the toner holder and is spaced apart from the toner layer in the spaced-apart area <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the head interval between the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> gradually increases in the direction away from the lower end portion of the contact area <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. However, in the vicinity of the lower end portion of the contact area <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has a curvature approximate to that of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the area between the vicinity of the lower end portion of the contact area <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the vicinity of the position at which the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> come closest to each other, the amount of increase in the head interval is very small, and the head interval is maintained to be equal to the thickness of the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in this area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> With such a configuration, even if the position of the toner passage hole row <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in the toner holder moving direction varies due to factors such as an error in the attachment of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> via the fixing means <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, the head interval at the position of the row of toner passage holes is maintained to be equal to the thickness of the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the recording characteristics from varying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present example employs a configuration in which the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is abutted on the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> via the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, as described above, whereby even if the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> has outer diameter variations, a cylindricity non-uniformity, a radial runout, etc., the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> moves in the horizontal direction along the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, whereby such variations can be absorbed. The toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is fixed in the vertical direction to the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> by the fixing means <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> so that the movement thereof in the vertical direction is restricted. If the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> has outer shape variations, a cylindricity non-uniformity, or a radial runout, the positional relationship between the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> formed in the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the toner holder moving direction varies. However, even in such a case, the head interval does not vary, and can be maintained to be constant, at the position of the toner passage holes, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present example, the end portion of the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction is located on the upstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the position at which the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> come closest to each other. With such a configuration in combination with the configuration in which the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has a curvature in the same direction as the toner holder and is spaced apart from the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the spaced-apart area <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, there is provided an effect of preventing the head interval from varying along with the change in the position of the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. In addition, by arranging the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> at the position at which the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> come closest to each other, the head interval and the distance between the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> can be minimized, thereby stabilizing the toner flight and reducing the applied voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> that is required for the toner flight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is possible to prevent the problem that after the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> once abuts on the toner layer at a position in the contact area <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may contact each other again at a position on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the abutting position. As a result, it is possible to prevent the problem that the contact between the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may become unstable in the intended contact area <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby varying the head interval and thus varying the recording characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present example, the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is parallel to the peripheral portion of the toner holder in the contact area <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the end portion of the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction is located at the terminal portion of the contact area on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction. In this way, the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>smoothly enters the contact area <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> contacts the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>over a large area in the contact area <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while the edge of the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction will not be brought into a linear contact with the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the stress applied on the toner layer from being localized at the abutting position, thereby reducing the thickness of the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and failing to obtain a sufficient image density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> Moreover, even if there are minute irregularities on the surface of the edge portion, the edge portion will not directly abut on the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, whereby the irregularities will not be transferred onto the toner layer to scratch the toner layer and to cause an image non-uniformity. Additional effects can be obtained if the end portion of the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction is subjected to a chamfer process or an R process. </paragraph>

The toner <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is pulled by the electric field formed by the back electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to pass through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, and flies while being deflected to the left so as to be applied to the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by about 40 &mgr;m to the left from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Next, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> as described above with the left and right deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being brought to 0 V, whereby the toner <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is applied to the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> at the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> as described above with &minus;150 V being applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and &plus;150 V being applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the negatively charged toner <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is deflected to the right, whereby the toner is applied to the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by again about 40 &mgr;m to the right from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. In this way, the toner is applied to three points, i.e., the left, right and center points, with a single toner passage hole <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, by successively changing the voltages applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> Note that during a non-image forming period, the voltage applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is set to be &minus;50 V so that the toner <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> does not fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> Note that in the present example, the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> has a curvature equal to that of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the upper end portion of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> itself has a curvature equal to that of the bent portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the lower end portion thereof, and the curvature continuously changes between the two different curvatures in the spaced-apart area <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>therebetween. Alternatively, the curvature of the bent portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be approximated to the curvature of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> while arranging the bent portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>close to the outer perimeter of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> so that the center of curvature is close to the center of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, whereby the curvature of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in the spaced-apart area <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be made substantially equal to the curvature thereof in the contact area <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and substantially constant in the spaced-apart area. In this way, as compared to a case as described above where the curvature continuously changes in the spaced-apart area <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, it is possible to reduce the amount of increase in the head interval on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction, and to further reduce the variations in the recording characteristics due to the variations in the head interval caused by the change in the position of the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> Next, Example <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the image forming device of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Note that the same elements as those of Example 3 will be denoted by the same reference numerals and will not be described below, and only the difference therebetween will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> The image forming device of the present example has a configuration different from that of Example 3 with respect to the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), toner passage control means <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> includes, on the upper surface of a main film <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, toner passage hole rows <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>each including a plurality of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, and the toner passage hole rows <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged in parallel to each other at a predetermined pitch p in the toner holder moving direction. For example, if two rows of toner passage holes are arranged so as to be staggered in the hole row direction, as illustrated in the figure, with each of the toner passage hole rows <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having a hole pitch of 254 &mgr;m (corresponding to 100 dpi), the total hole pitch for the two toner passage hole rows <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is 127 &mgr;m (corresponding to 200 dpi). The toner flies through each toner passage hole while being deflected in three directions as in Example 3. As a result, an image of 600 dpi can be formed on the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. Thus, along with the improvement in the recording resolution, it is possible to realize a process at a low cost while ensuring a sufficient opening area of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> and to stably control the toner flight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> A control electrode <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> is arranged on the upper surface of the insulative substrate <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 50 &mgr;m so as to surround the periphery of each of the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and an IC chip (not shown) for applying an image signal is connected to a lead electrode extending from the control electrode <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> A pair of deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged on the lower surface of the insulative substrate <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> so as to surround each toner passage hole <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> from opposite sides. The electrodes <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are made of a Cu film having a thickness of about 8 to 20 &mgr;m, which is patterned on the insulative substrate <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. The surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is coated with an insulative film <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> of 5 to 30 &mgr;m so as to prevent these electrodes from being shorted with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> The planar shape of each toner passage hole <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> is made of a long hole whose length L in the toner holder moving direction is greater than its width W in the direction perpendicular to the toner holder moving direction, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). In the illustrated example, the length L is set to be about 100 &mgr;m, and the width W is set to be about 70 to 80 &mgr;m. Moreover, the width of the control electrode <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> around the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> is set so that the width t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the major axis direction of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> is greater than the width t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the minor axis direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> The control electrode <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> and the driving IC therefor are connected to each other via a connection electrode <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is extending to the upstream side for the row <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> moves, and via a connection electrode <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that is extending to the downstream side for the row <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> on the downstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> moves. A voltage of 400 V or less is normally applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>, and in the present example, a voltage of 250 V is applied for forming dots and a voltage of &minus;50 V for not forming dots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the connection between the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the driving IC therefor is as follows. For the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on one side of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of both of the rows <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected together and connected to the driving IC via the connection electrode <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending to the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> moves.

<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a state where the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> including a plurality of rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> as described above is mounted on the developer supply unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and the casing member <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as those of Example 3. Two toner passage hole rows are arranged in symmetry with respect to a line between the center of the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the center of the back electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the position at which the toner holder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> come closest to each other, whereby it is possible to minimize the head intervals in the two rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> and the distance between the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and the image receiving means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and to realize a configuration in which the difference between the head interval in one of the two rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> and the head interval in the other one of the two rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> is reduced. In this way, even when employing a configuration in which the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> in the toner holder moving direction in order to improve the recording resolution, variations in the recording characteristics among different rows of toner passage holes will not occur due to the variations in the head interval among the rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, whereby the plurality of rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> can be controlled under the same conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> Note that while the toner passage control means and the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>abuts on each other via the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in Examples 3 and 4, the toner passage control means may alternatively abut directly on the toner layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>without the spacer means <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> therebetween. It is possible to reduce the head interval, thereby reducing the applied voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> that is required for the toner flight for obtaining a sufficient recording density. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> Example 5 of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> illustrates a general configuration of an image forming device according to Example 5. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is a print head, and the print head <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> includes a casing member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> that is open on the upper side and has an opening in the bottom portion, toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> arranged on the outer surface of a lower portion of the casing member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> so as to cover the opening, and a toner supply unit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> placed in the casing member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. A back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is arranged below the print head <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> with an appropriate gap therebetween, and image receiving means <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is passed through between the back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the print head <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> The toner supply unit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> includes a storage container <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> for storing a toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, which is a developer, a toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> arranged so as to meet an opening that is formed in a lower portion of the storage container <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, a limiting blade <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> for limiting a toner layer held and carried by the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and a supply roller <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> for stirring and frictionally charging the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> in the storage container <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> while supplying the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> to the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> The toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is formed by using a metal such as aluminum or iron or an alloy. In the present example, the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is a rotatable sleeve made of aluminum having an outer diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 1 mm, and the potential thereof is the ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> The limiting blade <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is made of an elastic member such as a urethane, and suitably has a hardness of 40 to 80 degrees (JIS K6301 A Scale), a free end length (the length of a portion thereof extending from the position where it is attached) of 5 to 15 mm, and a linear load on the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of 5 to 40 g/cm. One to three layers of toner are formed on the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> by the limiting blade <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The limiting blade <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is electrically floating in the present example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> The toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is interposed between the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the limiting blade <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, where it is subject to slight stirring and is charged by receiving a charge from the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In the present example, the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is a non-magnetic material having an average particle diameter of 8 &mgr;m, and has a negative charge of &minus;10 &mgr;C/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> The supply roller <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> is obtained by providing a synthetic rubber such as a urethane foam having a thickness of about 2 to 6 mm on a shaft made of a metal such as iron (having a diameter of 8 mm in the present example), so that the hardness thereof is 30 degrees (as measured by the method of JIS K6301 A Scale using a sample that has been processed into a roller shape). In addition to assisting in charging the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, it controls the supply thereof The amount by which the supply roller <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> is pushed into the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is preferably about 0.1 to 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> The toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> includes a flexible insulative base member <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> having an effective width that corresponds to the effective width of the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The insulative base member <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is provided with a large number of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> arranged at a minute pitch in the width direction of the image receiving means <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, whereby one or more rows of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are formed. A ring-shaped control electrode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>) is formed so as to surround each toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>) are formed on the lower surface of the insulative base member <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. The insulative base member <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a material such as polyimide or polyethylene terephthalate, and suitably has a thickness of 10 to 100 &mgr;m. In the present example, polyimide having a thickness of 50 &mgr;m is used as the insulative base member <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> illustrates, on an enlarged scale, an important part of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. In the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the plurality of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> provided in the insulative base member <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 50 &mgr;m are arranged in rows parallel to the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Moreover, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the control electrode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is arranged on the upper surface of the insulative base member <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> so as to surround the periphery of each of the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and a lead electrode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending from the control electrode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is connected to an IC chip, not shown, for applying an image signal. On the other hand, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the pair of deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged on the lower surface of the insulative substrate <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> so as to surround each toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> from opposite sides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> The electrodes <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are made of a Cu film having a thickness of about 8 to 20 &mgr;m, which is patterned on the insulative substrate <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is coated with an insulative film <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> of 5 to 30 &mgr;m so as to prevent these electrodes <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from being shorted with one another. While the shape of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is a circular shape in the illustrated example, it may alternatively be another shape such as an oblong circle shape or an elliptical shape. The diameter of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is set to be about 70 to 120 &mgr;m, for example. A voltage of 400 V or less is normally applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, and in the present example, a voltage of 250 V is applied for forming dots and a voltage of &minus;50 V for not forming dots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is fixed to the casing member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> by attachment means <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, at an end portion thereof that is on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> moves with respect to the contact point with the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (the moving direction rear end portion), and the downstream end portion (the moving direction front end portion) is fixed to attachment means <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> via a tension spring <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. (Of course, the upstream side portion and the downstream side portion of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may be reversed from those described above). The contact pressure between the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is suitably 0.2 to 2 gf/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> This is because the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> need to be always in contact with each other under the same condition, following the eccentricity of the rotation axis of the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, in order to maintain the interval between the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> at the position of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to be always appropriate, and because it is necessary to prevent an excessive contact pressure from deforming the toner layer on the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The contact pressure slightly varies depending on the material of the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> A spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> (distance limiting means) is provided on the surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> that opposes the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> includes a contact area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> contacts the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> via the toner layer on the surface thereof The spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> contacts the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in the contact area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby maintaining the interval (head interval) between the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to be a constant interval that is the same as the thickness of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> itself The spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is a sheet made of a metal or a conductive resin, and the thickness thereof is preferably 5 to 150 &mgr;m, and more preferably 5 to 20 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> When the toner supply unit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is attached to the casing member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, with the distance between the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> being limited to a predetermined dimension, the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> abuts on the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, and a pressing force from the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> acts on the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, thereby displacing the tension spring <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> that is suspended at an end of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Thus, the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, across the entire width thereof, is in close contact with the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> via the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The distance (head interval) between the toner layer on the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is precisely set by the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> at a value in the range of 0 to 200 &mgr;m, and 10 &mgr;m in the present example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> The spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is bonded and fixed by fixing means <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The fixing means <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> is preferably a resin-based or rubber-based adhesive or a double-sided adhesive tape, and the thickness thereof is preferably 2 to 150 &mgr;m, and more preferably 2 to 5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in a case where an antistatic layer (not shown) is coated on the surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in an area around the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, it is preferred that the fixing means <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> is provided not in that area but in an area where the antistatic layer is not present. This is because it is then possible to prevent the antistatic layer from being peeled off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> The fixing means <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> is arranged in an adhesion area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that does not overlap, in the thickness direction, with the contact area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is contacted, whereby even if the thickness of the fixing means <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> has individual variations or variations in the toner passage hole row direction, it will not influence and cause the head interval to vary. Thus, it is possible to constantly maintain the interval to be equal to the thickness of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> itself entirely across the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and thus to form a uniform image without non-uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in order to allow a sufficient amount of toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> for ensuring a required recording density to fly under a constant voltage application condition, it is necessary to set the head interval to be very small, i.e., about 10 &mgr;m. In such a case, however, even a slight head interval variation results in a relatively increased degree of variation, whereby it is typically very difficult to obtain a constant recording density entirely across the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> without non-uniformity. However, in the present example, the head interval is maintained by the thickness of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> itself irrespective of the variations in the thickness of the fixing means <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to easily ensure a minute head interval of about 10 &mgr;m, and to form a uniform image without non-uniformity entirely across the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by reducing the thickness of the adhesive layer of the fixing means <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to be smaller than the average particle diameter of the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, it is possible to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> from intruding into a portion other than the adhesion area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>along the interface between the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to increase the head interval by the thickness of the intruding toner, thereby constantly maintaining the interval to be equal to the thickness of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the adhesion area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is arranged on the upstream side in the toner holder rotation direction with respect to the contact area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the frictional force applied from the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in the contact area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>equals the tensile force that acts on the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> between the contact area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the adhesion area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Therefore, even when the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is made of a very thin member having a thickness of 20 &mgr;m or less, the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> will not be buckled or bent, and the flatness of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is desirably ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> has a shape and a size such that the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> does not contact the surface of the toner layer formed on the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in an area on the upstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the contact area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, whereby it is possible to prevent an image non-uniformity due to the toner layer being disturbed before the contact area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is arranged so as to oppose the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> with the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween. The back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> functions as a counter electrode so as to form an electric field between the back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and the back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is a metal or a resin in which a conductive filler is dispersed. While a DC voltage of about 500 V to 2000 V is applied to the back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, a voltage of 1000 V is applied in the present example. Moreover, the distance between the back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is 150 to 1000 &mgr;m, and it is set to be 350 &mgr;m in the present example. The image receiving means <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> such as recording paper is passed through between the back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the print head <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the image receiving means <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is recording paper, an image holding belt, or the like, and is carried in the direction of an arrow along a predetermined path extending between the back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> An image forming operation with an image forming device having such a configuration will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), first, the negatively charged toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> that is adsorbed on the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is allowed to fly by applying a voltage of 250 V to the control electrode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, with &plus;150 V being applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and &minus;150 V being applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is pulled by the electric field formed by the back electrode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to pass through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and flies while being deflected to the left so as to be applied to the image receiving means <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by about 40 &mgr;m to the left from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Next, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> as described above with the left and right deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being brought to 0 V. Thus, the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is applied to the image receiving means <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> at the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> as described above with &minus;150 V being applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and &plus;150 V being applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, whereby the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is applied to the image receiving means <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by again about 40 &mgr;m to the right from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. In this way, the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is applied to three points, i.e., the left, right and center points, with a single toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, by successively changing the voltages applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Note that during a non-image forming period, the voltage applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is set to be &minus;50 V so that the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> does not fly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> Next, Example 6 of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. Note that in Example 6 and Example 7 to follow, the same elements as those of Example 5 will be denoted by the same reference numerals and will not be described in detail below, and only the difference therebetween will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the image forming device of the present example employs a configuration different from that of Example 5 with respect to the fixing means for the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> Fixing means <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> of the present example is extending over the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> so as to seal an end portion of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in the toner holder moving direction, and is formed by applying a resin-based or rubber-based adhesive on the portion and then curing it through a drying step. Note that in a case where an antistatic layer (not shown) is coated on the surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in an area around the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, it is preferred that the fixing means <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is provided not in that area but in an area where the antistatic layer is not present. This is because it is then possible to prevent the antistatic layer from being peeled off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> The present example provides the following effect in addition to those obtained in Example 5. That is, by using the fixing means <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> extending over the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> so as to seal an end portion of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> moves (the moving direction rear end portion), the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be in close contact with each other across the entire area of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> moves. Therefore, as compared to Example 5 where the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is bent in the area between the adhesion area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the contact area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the flatness of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> can be improved, and the corrugation of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in the contact area <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the direction parallel to the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> In addition, since no adhesive layer is present between the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the adherence between the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is improved, the intrusion of the toner <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> into the interface between the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is reduced from that of Example 5, and the head interval can be stably and constantly maintained to be equal to the thickness of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> itself for a long period of time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 7 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> Next, Example 7 of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. An image forming device of the present example employs a configuration different from those of Examples 5 and 6 with respect to the fixing means between the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> Fixing means <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> of the present example is made of an adhesive tape attached over the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> so as to cover an end portion of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> on the upstream side in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> moves (the moving direction rear end portion), and provides the following effect in addition to those obtained in Examples 5 and 6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> That is, by using an adhesive tape as the fixing means <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, as compared to a case where the fixing means <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> of a sealing material of Example 6 is used, the adhesive application step, the curing step and the drying step can be omitted, thereby significantly improving the assembly efficiency in fixing the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in a case where an antistatic layer (not shown) is coated on the surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in an area around the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, it is preferred that the fixing means <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is provided not in that area but in an area where the antistatic layer is not present. This is because it is then possible to prevent the antistatic layer from being peeled off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> Moreover, with the fixing means <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> of the present example, as compared to the fixing means <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> of Example 6 as a sealing material, the thickness of the fixing means itself can be reduced due to the use of an adhesive tape. Moreover, it is not necessary to take into consideration the variations in the thickness of the fixing means that are caused by the variations in the amount of adhesive applied in the application step, and it is possible to reduce the distance of the space between the toner layer and the fixing means <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> that is provided for preventing the fixing means <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> and the toner layer from contacting each other. With such a configuration, the fixing means <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> can be arranged at a position close to the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and the length of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> moves can be reduced, thereby reducing the size of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> Note that in Examples 5 to 7, the fixing means <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> are provided in the direction parallel to the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and over a larger area than the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, whereby it is possible to precisely maintain the head interval to be constant across the entire length of the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in Examples 6 and 7, the fixing means <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> may be provided in the direction parallel to the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and over a larger area than the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> while being divided into a plurality of portions in the direction parallel to the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. In the step of bonding and fixing the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, it is possible to prevent the corrugation of the spacer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> occurring in the direction parallel to the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> during the bonding operation, and it is possible to reduce the amount of material used in the fixing means <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, thereby reducing the cost. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> The material of the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is preferably a polyparaxylene resin (parylene), which is coated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), or silicon oxide or silicon nitride, which is also coated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Particularly, the latter is preferred because a sufficient degree of insulation and moisture resistance can be obtained with a thickness of about 2 &mgr;m, whereby the head interval can be considerably reduced as compared to the thickness of 5 to 20 &mgr;m that is required in the former, and the applied voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> that is required for allowing the toner to fly can be reduced.

The fixing portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a planar portion that is arranged so as to extend substantially along the extension in the extension direction in which the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is extended to the upstream side in the toner holder moving direction after coming apart from the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The contact pressure between the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> is suitably 2 to 20 MPa (0.2 to 2 gf/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). This is because the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> need to be always in contact with each other in an appropriate manner under the same condition, following the eccentricity of the rotation axis of the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, in order to always maintain the interval between the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> at the position of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, and because it is necessary to prevent an excessive contact pressure from deforming the toner layer <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The contact pressure slightly varies depending on the material of the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is spacer means formed on the surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> that opposes the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) are cross-sectional views illustrating the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> taken in a direction parallel to, and in a direction perpendicular to, the toner holder moving direction, and a plan view and a bottom view illustrating the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> will be described in detail with reference to these figures. The spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is formed by printing a conductive thick film on the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is preferably 5 to 150 &mgr;m, and more particularly 5 to 20 &mgr;m, and it is set to be 10 &mgr;m in the present example. The material of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is a cold setting silver paste. After screen-printing the silver paste on the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, it is left standing for five minutes for leveling, and then dried and cured at a temperature of 220&deg; C. or less, specifically 60 to 80&deg; C., and for 30 minutes. While the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> includes irregularities running in the primary scanning direction and having a height that corresponds to the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, the surface of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> formed on the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is limited to the height at which a squeegee passes in the screen printing process. Therefore, the irregularities are leveled by being filled with the silver paste, thereby making the surface of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> flat. Moreover, even if irregularities remain on the surface of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, the irregularities can be eliminated by increasing the degree of dilution of the silver paste or increasing the amount of time for which the silver paste is left standing for leveling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> The surface roughness Rz (JIS B0601 with a reference length of 0.8 mm) of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is preferably 2 &mgr;m or more and 8 &mgr;m or less, and in the present example, the surface roughness Rz of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> as a whole is set to be 3.2 z. Note that while a silver paste is used in the present example, it may alternatively be another conductive paste such as Au, Ag&mdash;Pd, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, when the toner supply unit <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is attached to the casing member <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, with the distance between the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the back electrode <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> being limited to a predetermined dimension, the toner layer <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> abuts on the spacer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is wound around the outer perimeter of a bent portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is located at the lower end portion of the casing member <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and which has a curvature smaller than that of the outer perimeter of the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, and then elastically held by the attachment means <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the casing member <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> via the tension spring <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> that is suspended at the end on the downstream side. In such a state, the tension spring <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> is displaced, resisting against the pressing force from the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to the spacer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. Thus, the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, across the entire width thereof, is in close contact with the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> via the spacer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. The distance (head interval) between the toner layer <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is precisely maintained by the spacer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> at a value in the range of 0 to 200 &mgr;m, and 10 &mgr;m in the present example. The tension on the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> is a value that is set so as to obtain an appropriate contact pressure of 2 to 20 MPa (0.2 to 2 gf/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) between the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> as described above, and is relatively small for the rigidity of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> itself </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> The present example employs a configuration in which the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is abutted on the toner layer <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> via the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, as described above, whereby even if the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> has outer diameter variations, a cylindricity non-uniformity, or a radial runout, the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> moves in the horizontal direction along the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, whereby such variations can be absorbed. In this way, the head interval at the position of the row of toner passage holes is maintained to be equal to the thickness of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the recording characteristics from varying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is a back electrode arranged so as to oppose the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> with the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween, and the back electrode <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> functions as a counter electrode so as to form an electric field between the back electrode <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The back electrode <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> may be a metal or a resin in which a conductive filler is dispersed. While a DC voltage of about 500 V to 2000 V is applied to the back electrode <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, a voltage of 1000 V is applied in the present example. Moreover, the distance between the back electrode <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is 150 to 1000 &mgr;m, and it is set to be 350 &mgr;m in the present example. An image receiving member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> such as recording paper is passed through between the back electrode <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and the print head <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is image receiving means such as recording paper or an image holding belt that is carried in the direction of arrow &ldquo;a&rdquo; along a predetermined path extending between the back electrode <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> An image forming operation with such a configuration will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. First, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> adsorbed on the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is allowed to fly by applying a voltage of 250 V to the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> with &plus;150 V being applied to the deflection electrode <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> and &minus;150 V being applied to the deflection electrode <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the right so that the negatively charged toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is deflected to the left. The toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> having flown off the toner holder <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is pulled by the electric field formed by the back electrode <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> to pass through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, and flies while being deflected to the left so as to be applied to the image receiving means <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by about 40 &mgr;m, for example, to the left from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Then, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> as described above with the left and right deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being brought to 0 V, whereby the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is applied to the image receiving means <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> at the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Next, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> as described above with &minus;150 V being applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and &plus;150 V being applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the negatively charged toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is deflected to the right. Thus, the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is applied to the image receiving means <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by again about 40 &mgr;m, for example, to the right from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. In this way, the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> can be applied to three points, i.e., the left, right and center points, with a single toner passage hole <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, by successively changing the voltages applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> Note that during a non-image forming period, the voltage applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> is set to be &minus;50 V so that the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> does not fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the present example, since the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> can be formed integrally with the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> by printing a thick conductive film on the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, it is possible to easily form the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 10 &mgr;m on the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the thickness can be further reduced, and it is then possible to reduce the head interval and to reduce the applied voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> that is required for allowing the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> to fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the positional precision of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> with respect to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> can be improved, and it is possible to prevent variations in the flight characteristics of the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> which are caused by the variations in the head interval when the distance between the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> and the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> varies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> Moreover, this eliminates the assembly operation of precisely attaching the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> having a thickness on the order of 10 &mgr;m or so to the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> so that the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is not deformed. Thus, it is possible to eliminate the problem in the prior art that a very careful handling of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, which is a separate piece, is required, thereby increasing the number of assembly steps in mass production and increasing the cost due to frequent misoperation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> Moreover, with the method for forming the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> according to the present example, depressions of the irregularities on the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> that have a height corresponding to the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> are filled with a silver paste and are leveled, thereby making the surface of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> flat. Thus, it is possible to prevent the irregularities on the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> from being expressed as irregularities on the surface of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, thereby causing irregularities on the toner layer <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that contacts the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> which are transferred onto the image to cause a minute density non-uniformity in the recorded image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> In a case where the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is formed through vapor deposition by a thin film process such as sputtering or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the vapor deposition of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is performed with a uniform thickness on the insulative base member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> or the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, whereby the surface of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> includes irregularities running in the primary scanning direction and having a height that corresponds to the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, and such irregularities cause a thickness non-uniformity in the toner layer, thus causing the minute density nonuniformity. In the present example, such problems as described above do not occur, whereby the minute density non-uniformity can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the material of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is a cold setting silver paste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> After screen-printing the silver paste, it is dried and cured at a temperature of 220&deg; C. or less, specifically 60 to 80&deg; C., and for 30 minutes. In this way, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of a crease and corrugation in the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> due to heat contraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in a case where the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is formed only in a portion of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> having a large surface area, as in the image forming device of the present invention, the method for forming the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> according to the present example is more advantageous in that the material can be screen-printed only in portions where it is required, thus providing the effect of reducing the material cost and the depreciation cost of facilities, as compared to the case of using a thin film process in which the material is vapor-deposited across the entire area of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> including portions that are masked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is made of a thick conductive film and has a good conductivity, whereby it is possible to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> from being excessively charged by the sliding movement between the surface of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> and the toner layer <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> from electrostatically attaching to the surface of the spacer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, and to prevent such excessive charging from influencing the flight characteristics of the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> to cause the image density, the pixel forming position, etc., to vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is made of a metal material and has a good abrasion resistance. The abrasion resistance can further be improved further by vapor-depositing Ni to a thickness of about 1 to 2 &mgr;m on the surface of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. The hardness is preferably 200 Hv or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present example, the surface roughness Rz (JIS B0601 with a reference length of 0.8 mm) of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is set to be 3.2 z. With such a configuration, it is possible to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> from attaching to the surface of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> in a long-term use. In a case where a recording operation is performed continuously over a long period of time, with the surface roughness of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> being about 12.5 z, toner particles will accidentally be fused on the surface of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> and the toner will gradually accumulate with the fused toner being a nucleus. Then, the protrusion scratches the toner layer, and the disturbance in the toner layer is transferred onto the recorded image, thereby causing a minute streak in the recorded image. When the recording operation is further continued over a long period of time, the number of such protrusions gradually increases while the size of each protrusion also increases, finally resulting in a state where the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is fused and accumulated in a planar shape over a certain area, though such an area is partial. If the amount of toner accumulated varies in the direction parallel to the row of toner passage holes (the primary scanning direction), it will cause variations in the interval (head interval) between the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the toner layer in the primary scanning direction, thereby causing variations in the recording characteristics, which in turn cause a strip-shaped density non-uniformity parallel to the secondary scanning direction in the recorded image formed on the image receiving means <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> In contrast, by setting the surface roughness Rz of the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> to be about 3.2 z, the adhesion force of the fused toner particle is reduced so that the fused toner particle is easily removed by the sliding movement against the toner layer, thereby preventing the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> from gradually accumulating with the fused toner particle being a nucleus. Thus, it is possible to prevent a density non-uniformity from occurring on the recorded image due to variations in the head interval in a long-term use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present example, the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of silicon oxide. Therefore, a sufficient degree of insulation and moisture resistance can be obtained with a thickness of about 2 &mgr;m, while the head interval can be reduced as compared to the thickness of 5 to 20 &mgr;m that is required in other methods, and the applied voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> that is required for allowing the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> to fly can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is subjected to a surface treatment using an antistatic material and electrically grounded. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> from being excessively charged by the sliding movement between the surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the toner layer <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> from electrostatically attaching to the surface of the toner passage control means <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and to prevent such excessive charging from influencing the flight characteristics of the toner <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> to cause the image density, the pixel forming position, etc., to vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> Note that while the present example employs a configuration in which the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is arranged on the upstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, effects as those of the present invention can be provided by an alternative configuration in which the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is arranged on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the row of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is formed on the insulative film <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> by a thick film process, the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> may alternatively be covered with an insulative film after forming it on the surface of the insulative substrate <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> in a similar manner. In such a case, by selecting an insulative material for the spacer means <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, the material can be directly printed on the control electrode <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 9 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> Next, Example 9 of the image forming device of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> illustrating a general configuration of the image forming device, reference numeral <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is a print head, and the print head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> includes a casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> that is open on one side (the right side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>) and has an opening in a portion on the opposite side (a portion on the left side in the figure), a toner supply unit <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> placed in the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, and a toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> arranged so as to cover the opening of the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> from the outside. A back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is arranged at a position opposing the toner supply unit <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> with the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> being interposed therebetween, and with an appropriate interval between the back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. An image receiver <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> such as recording paper is passed in the direction of arrow &ldquo;a&rdquo; shown in the figure along a predetermined path between the back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and the print head <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> The toner supply unit <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> includes a container <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> having an opening in the bottom portion thereof for storing a toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, which is a developer, a toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> that is arranged in the opening of the container <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> so as to be rotatable about an axis line extending in the width direction of the image receiver <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> (the direction perpendicular to the passage direction &ldquo;a&rdquo;), a supply roller <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> that is arranged in the vicinity of the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> so as to be rotatable about an axis line parallel to the axis of the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and so as to be pushed into the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> for stirring and frictionally charging the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> in the container <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> while supplying the toner to the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, and a limiting blade <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> attached to the container <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> for limiting the toner layer held and carried on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The toner supply unit <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is inserted into the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> from right to left in the figure and is set at a predetermined position in the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> The toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is formed by using a metal such as aluminum or iron or an alloy. In the present example, the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is a sleeve made of an aluminum alloy having an outer diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 1 mm, and the potential thereof is the ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> The supply roller <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> is obtained by providing a synthetic rubber such as a urethane foam having a uniform thickness of about 2 to 6 mm on a shaft made of a metal such as iron (having a diameter of 8 mm in the present example), so that the hardness thereof is 30 degrees (as measured by the method of JIS K<highlight><italic><highlight><bold>6301</bold></highlight> </italic></highlight>A Scale using a sample that has been processed into a roller shape). In addition to assisting in charging the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, it controls the supply of the toner to the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Note that the amount by which it is pushed into the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is preferably about 0.1 to 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> The limiting blade <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is made of an elastic member such as a urethane, and forms one to three layers of toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The limiting blade <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is electrically floating in the present example. Note that it suitably has a hardness of 40 to 80 degrees (on the same scale as above), a free end length (the length of a portion thereof extending from a portion of the container <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> to which it is attached) of 5 to 15 mm, and a linear load on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of 5 to 40 N/m (5 to 40 g/cm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> The toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is interposed between the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the limiting blade <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, where it is subject to slight stirring and is charged by receiving a charge from the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. In the present example, the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is a non-magnetic material having an average particle diameter of 8 &mgr;m, and has a negative charge of &minus;10 &mgr;C/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> The toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> includes a flexible insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> having an effective width that corresponds to the effective width of the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a material such as polyimide or polyethylene terephthalate, and suitably has a thickness of 10 to 100 &mgr;m. In the present example, polyimide having a thickness of 50 &mgr;m is used as the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. The insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is provided with a large number of toner passage holes <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, and the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> are arranged in one or more rows at a minute pitch in the direction parallel to the axis of the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, whereby one or more rows of toner passage holes are formed. In the present example, the pitch between the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is set to be 125 &mgr;m, corresponding to 200 dpi, for a recording resolution of 600 dpi, and the toner passage holes are arranged in a single row. Each of the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is provided with a control electrode and deflection electrodes to be described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is an enlarged view illustrating an electrode portion of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> mentioned above is arranged on the surface of the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> that is closer to the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> so as to have a ring shape surrounding the periphery of each toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, and an IC chip (not shown) for applying an image signal is connected to a lead portion extending from each control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. A voltage of 400 V or less is normally applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, and in the present example, a voltage of 250 V is applied during an image forming period and a voltage of &minus;50 V during a non-image forming period. On the other hand, on the surface of the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> that is closer to the back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>mentioned above are provided as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>form a pair and are arranged so as to surround the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> from opposite sides. The control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are made of a Cu film having a thickness of about 8 to 20 &mgr;m, which is patterned on the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. An insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> having a thickness of 2 to 30 &mgr;m is formed on surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), so as to prevent these electrodes <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from being shorted with one another. Such an insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> is preferably formed by coating a polyparaxylene resin (parylene) through chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and in the present example, it is formed by depositing an insulative film having a thickness of 20 &mgr;m and made of a polyparaxylene resin through chemical vapor deposition. Moreover, the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> is subjected to a surface treatment using an antistatic material (not shown), and the antistatic material is electrically grounded. The surface treatment using an antistatic material is preferably a coating process using a boron-based antistatic polymer. The thickness thereof is preferably 5 to 10 &mgr;m, and the surface resistance value is preferably 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>13 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;/&square;. While the shape of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is a circular shape and the size thereof is set so that the diameter is about 70 to 120 &mgr;in the illustrated example, it may alternatively be another shape such as an oblong circle shape or an elliptical shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> The toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is fixed to a fixing portion <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> by attachment means <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight>, at a position that is on the upstream side (the left side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>) in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the contact point with the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, and is fixed to a stop portion <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> via a tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> at a position that is on the downstream side (the right side in the figure). Of course, the positional relationship of being on the upstream side and the downstream side between the attachment means <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight> and the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> may be reversed. The contact pressure between the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> is suitably 0.002 to 0.02 MPa (0.2 to 2 gf/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). This is because the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> need to be always in contact with each other under the same condition, following the eccentricity of the rotation axis of the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, in order to always maintain the head interval, i.e., the interval between the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> at the position of the toner passage hole, and because it is necessary to prevent an excessive contact pressure from deforming the toner layer on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The contact pressure slightly varies depending on the material of the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> The back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> functions as a counter electrode for forming, between the back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, a transfer electric field for sucking the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, and is made of a material obtained by dispersing a conductive filler in a metal or a resin. A DC voltage of about 500 to 2000 V is typically applied to the back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, and a voltage of 1000 V is applied in the present example. Moreover, while the distance between the back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is suitably 150 to 1000 &mgr;m, it is set to be 350 &mgr;m in the present example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0407&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the present example, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is provided with spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> that are formed on the upstream side and the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the row of toner passage holes. The spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are in contact with the toner layer on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> in contact areas <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, respectively, thereby limiting the head interval to the thickness of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> The spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> will be described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. The spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are formed by screen-printing a thick conductive film on the insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is preferably 5 to 150 &mgr;m, and more preferably 5 to 20 &mgr;m. In the present example, they have an equal thickness of 10 &mgr;m. The material of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is a cold setting silver paste. The silver paste is screen-printed on the insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, and then left standing for 5 minutes for leveling, after which it is dried and cured at a temperature of 220&deg; C. or less, specifically 60 to 80&deg; C., and for 30 minutes. While the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> includes irregularities running in the primary scanning direction (the direction of the row of toner passage holes) and having a height that corresponds to the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, the surface of the spacer portion <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> formed on the insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> is limited to the height at which a squeegee passes in the screen printing process. Therefore, they are leveled with each depression between the control electrodes <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> being filled with the silver paste, thereby making the surface of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> flat. Note that if irregularities remain on the surface of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, the irregularities can be eliminated by increasing the degree of dilution of the silver paste or increasing the amount of time for which the silver paste is left standing for leveling. The surface roughness Rz (JIS B0601 with a reference length of 0.8 mm) of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is preferably 2 &mgr;m or more and 8 &mgr;m or less. In the present example, the surface roughness Rz of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> as a whole, including the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, is suppressed to 3.2 Z. Moreover, the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are made of a metal material and have a good abrasion resistance. The abrasion resistance can further be improved further by vapor-depositing Ni to a thickness of about 1 to 2 &mgr;m on the surface of the spacers <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>. The hardness is preferably 200 Hv or more. Note that while a silver paste is used as the material of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> in the present example, it may alternatively be another conductive paste such as Au, Ag&mdash;Pd, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> In the image forming device as described above, when the toner supply unit <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is placed in the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, with the distance between the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> being limited to a predetermined dimension, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is elastically held in the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> via the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> that is suspended at the end on the downstream side, and the toner layer formed on the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> successively comes into contact with the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> as the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> rotates. In such a state, the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> is displaced, resisting against the pressing force from the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>. Thus, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, across the entire width thereof, is in close contact with the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> via the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, whereby the head interval is precisely maintained by the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> at a value in the range of 5 to 150 &mgr;m, and 10 &mgr;m in the present example. The tension on the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> is a value that is appropriately set so as to obtain an appropriate contact pressure of 0.002 to 0.02 MPa (0.2 to 2 gf/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) between the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0410&rsqb;</number> An image forming operation of the image forming device having such a configuration will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. First, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>adsorbed on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> are allowed to fly by applying a voltage of 250 V to the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> with a voltage of &plus;150 V being applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a voltage of &minus;150 V being applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the charged toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is deflected to the left. The toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are pulled by the electric field formed by the back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> to pass through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, and fly while being deflected to the left, whereby the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are applied to the image receiver <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by about 40 &mgr;m to the left from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. Then, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> as described above with the applied voltage to the left and right deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being brought to 0 V, whereby the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are applied to the image receiver <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> at the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. Next, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a voltage is applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> as described above with a voltage of &minus;150 V being applied to the left deflection electrode <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a voltage of &plus;150 V being applied to the right deflection electrode <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are deflected to the right. Thus, the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are applied to the image receiver <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> at a position that is displaced by again about 40 &mgr;m to the right from the position opposing the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. In this way, the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be applied to three points, i.e., the left, right and center points, with a single toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, by successively changing the voltages applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Note that during a non-image forming period, the voltage applied to the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> is set to be &minus;50 V so that the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>do not fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0411&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the image forming device of the present example, the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are provided on the upstream side and the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the row of toner passage holes of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, and the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are in contact with the toner layer on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, whereby the head interval in the vicinity of the row of toner passage holes between the contact areas <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>corresponding to the upstream and downstream spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, respectively, can be maintained to be constant, thus preventing the toner flight characteristics from varying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0412" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0412&rsqb;</number> Now for the purpose of comparison, the conventional example will be described again. The spacer portion is provided only on the upstream side with respect to the row of toner passage holes, with the toner passage control device being attached to the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> via the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> on the downstream side thereof. In such a case, the curvature of the toner passage control device on the downstream side with respect to the spacer portion is determined by the balance between the flexural rigidity of the toner passage control device itself and the tension from the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the curvature of the toner passage control device will be varied by various factors such as variations in rigidity due to variations in the base member thickness of the toner passage control device, etc., variations in rigidity due to changes in the temperature, a decrease in rigidity over time (by being reshaped), variations in the tensile force of the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, and variations in the position at which the toner passage control device is attached to the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Then, due to such variations in curvature, the head interval varies in the vicinity of the row of toner passage holes, whereby the toner flight characteristics vary to lower the image quality. Particularly, where the thickness of the spacer portion is as small as about 10 &mgr;m, the spacer portion once contacts the toner layer at a position in the contact area, and then the toner passage control device and the toner layer contact again with each other on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the contact position. As a result, the contact between the spacer portion and the toner layer in the intended contact area becomes unstable, thereby varying the head interval and thus varying the recording characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> In contrast, in the present example, the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are arranged on the upstream side and the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the row of toner passage holes of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, as described above, whereby the head interval can be maintained to be constant in the vicinity of the row of toner passage holes. Therefore, as described above, the head interval can be stably maintained even if the flexural rigidity of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> changes due to the temperature, etc., and it is possible to prevent problems such as a decrease in the image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> Moreover, even if the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> has outer diameter variations, a cylindricity non-uniformity, or a radial runout, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> moves along the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> forward and backward in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> moves while maintaining the head interval to be constant, whereby such variations, etc., can be absorbed. In this way, the head interval at the position of the row of toner passage holes is maintained to be equal to the thickness of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the recording characteristics from varying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> Next, the present example provides the following advantages with respect to the attachment of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0416" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0416&rsqb;</number> That is, the fixing portion <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, to which the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is fixed on the upstream side, is located substantially along the extension in the direction in which the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is extended after coming apart from the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, and the stop portion <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, to which the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is fixed on the downstream side via the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, is also located substantially along the extension in the direction in which the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is extended after coming apart from the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Thus, no undesired bending moment occurs in the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, and the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> can be uniformly contacted with the toner layer in the contact areas <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0417" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0417&rsqb;</number> This similarly applies to the area of the row of toner passage holes located between the contact areas <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Specifically, the cross-sectional shape of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> between the contact areas <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is determined by the curvatures of the contact areas <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the tension applied by the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> on the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> does not act as a bending moment for the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> in the area. Therefore, the head interval can be stably maintained at a predetermined dimension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0418&rsqb;</number> Moreover, between the row of toner passage holes and the fixing portion <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is extended substantially along a straight line with no undesired bending. Therefore, when the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is attached to the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, the positioning precision of the row of toner passage holes with respect to the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> can be improved. Moreover, between the row of toner passage holes and the fixing portion <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is similarly extended substantially along a straight line with no undesired bending. Therefore, in the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, which has once been positioned and fixed to the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, the radius of curvature will not be changed by a change in the flexural rigidity thereof due to a change in the temperature, etc., or the position of the row of toner passage holes will not be changed by a change in the temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0419" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0419&rsqb;</number> Next, the present example provides the following advantages due to the use of a thick film printing process for the formation of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0420" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0420&rsqb;</number> The spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are formed by screen-printing a conductive cold setting silver paste on the insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. If the degree of dilution of the silver paste is increased and an appropriate leveling time is provided after the screen printing process, ridge portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the upstream side and the downstream side of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> in the toner holder moving direction are formed to have a curved cross section with a radius that is about &frac12; of the thickness of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> due to the surface tension of the material. In this way, when the toner layer enters the contact area <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which the downstream side spacer portion <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is contacted, the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is prevented from being scratched off by the upstream side ridge portion <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the spacer portion <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, which has been scratched off, will not accumulate in the space between the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, and a so-called &ldquo;fogging phenomenon&rdquo; in which the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is ejected from the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> during a non-image forming period will not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0421" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0421&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the step of forming the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, depressions of the irregularities on the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> that have a height corresponding to the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> are filled with a silver paste and are leveled, thereby making the surface of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> flat. Thus, it is possible to prevent the irregularities on the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> from being expressed as irregularities on the surface of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, thereby causing irregularities on the toner layer that contacts the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> which are transferred onto the image to cause a minute density non-uniformity in the recorded image. In a case where the spacer portion <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> is formed through vapor deposition by a thin film process such as sputtering or chemical vapor deposition, the vapor deposition of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is performed with a uniform thickness on the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> or the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, whereby the surface of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> includes irregularities running in the primary scanning direction and having a height that corresponds to the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, and such irregularities cause a thickness non-uniformity in the toner layer, thus causing the minute density non-uniformity. In the present example, however, such problems do not occur as described above, whereby the minute density non-uniformity can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0422" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0422&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the material of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is a cold setting silver paste that is screen-printed and then dried and cured at a temperature of 220&deg; C. or less, specifically 60 to 80&deg; C., and for 30 minutes. In this way, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of a crease and corrugation in the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> due to heat contraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0423" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0423&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in devices such as the present image forming device in which the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are formed only in portions of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, which has a large area, with the method for forming the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> according to the present example, the material can be screen-printed only in portions where it is required. Therefore, the material cost and the depreciation cost of facilities can be reduced, as compared to, for example, the case of using a thin film process in which the material is vapor-deposited across the entire area of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> including portions that are masked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0424" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0424&rsqb;</number> Next, the present invention provides the following advantages in that the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> can be formed integrally with the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> through a screen printing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> That is, it is possible to easily form the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 10 &mgr;m on the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the thickness can be further reduced, whereby it is possible to reduce the head interval and to reduce the applied voltage to the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> that is required for allowing the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the positional precision of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> with respect to the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> can be improved, and thus it is possible to prevent variations in the flight characteristics of the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> which are caused by the variations in the head interval when the distance between the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> and the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> varies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0427" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0427&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is possible to eliminate an assembly operation of precisely attaching spacer portions, which are separate pieces in the prior art, to the toner passage control device without deforming the spacer portions, thereby preventing the number of assembly steps in mass production from increasing and the cost from increasing due to frequent misoperation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0428" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0428&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present example provides the following advantages. That is, since the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are conductive, it is possible to prevent the toner from being excessively charged by the sliding movement against the toner layer, whereby it is possible to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> from electrostatically attaching to the surface of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, and to prevent such excessive charging from adversely influencing the flight characteristics of the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> to cause the image density, the pixel forming position, etc., to vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0429" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0429&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the surface roughness Rz of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is suppressed to 3.2 Z, the adhesion force of the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>fused on the surface of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> can be suppressed to be small, and thus the fused toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be easily removed by the sliding movement against the toner layer, thereby preventing the toner from gradually accumulating with the fused toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>being a nucleus. Thus, it is possible to prevent the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> from attaching to the surface of the spacers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> in a long-term use, and to prevent a density nonuniformity from occurring on the recorded image due to variations in the head interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0430" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0430&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the surface of the insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> is subjected to a surface treatment using an antistatic material, and is electrically grounded. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from being excessively charged by the sliding movement between the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the toner layer, whereby it is possible to prevent the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from electrostatically attaching to the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and to prevent such excessive charging from adversely influencing the flight characteristics of the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> to cause the image density, the pixel forming position, etc., to vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0431&rsqb;</number> Note that the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> are arranged in a single row, and the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> on the upstream side and the downstream side of the row of toner passage holes have an equal thickness in the present example. Alternatively, a plurality of rows of toner passage holes may be arranged in the direction in which the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> moves, with the thickness of the spacer portion <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> on the upstream side of the plurality of rows of toner passage holes being different from the thickness of the spacer portion <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> on the downstream side. In such a case, in the area between the contact areas <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the head interval continuously varies in the range equal to the difference between the two thickness dimensions of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a head interval appropriate for each row of toner passage holes can be set by independently setting the thicknesses of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>. Particularly, the amount of toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> to be supplied tends to relatively decrease for a row of toner passage holes on the downstream side with respect to another row of toner passage holes on the upstream side, whereby it is possible to obtain, on the downstream side, flight characteristics as those on the upstream side by compensating for the decrease in the toner supply, if the head interval for a row of toner passage holes on the downstream side is set to be smaller than that for another row of toner passage holes on the upstream side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0432&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> on the upstream side and the downstream side are formed to be separate from each other in the present example. Alternatively, it is possible to provide a spacer portion having a rectangular ring shape by connecting ends of the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> to each other in a non-recording area on the outer side of each end of each row of toner passage holes in the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, where the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> are not present. In such a case, the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> can be continuously contacted with the toner layer in the nonrecording area, thereby stably holding the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0433" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0433&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are formed on the insulative film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> in the present example, the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> may be covered with an insulative film after forming them directly on the surface of the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. In such a case, by selecting an insulative material for the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, the material can be directly printed on the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> Next, Example 10 of the image forming device of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. The image forming device of the present example employs a configuration different from that of Example 9 with respect to the cross-sectional structure of a toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. Note that the same elements as those of Example 9 will be denoted by the same reference numerals and will not be described below, and the description below will be mainly on only the difference therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, each toner passage hole <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> formed in the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is provided with the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the pair of deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which are structurally the same as those of Example 9,on the upper surface and the reverse surface, respectively, so as to surround the periphery of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>, with cover layers <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> being layered so as to sandwich the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> therebetween. The material of the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> is preferably polyimide, polyethylene terephthalate, or the like, and the thickness thereof is suitably 10 to 100 &mgr;m. In the present example, it is formed using polyimide to a thickness of 20 &mgr;m, and bonded to the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> by being pressed with heat via an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0436&rsqb;</number> The adhesive layer <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is preferably a sheet having a thickness of about 10 &mgr;m and made of a thermosetting resin such as an epoxy modified resin. Moreover, the heat pressing process is performed at 80 to 120&deg; C., and then it is left standing at 100 to 150&deg; C. for one hour for thermal setting. The thickness of each of the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is substantially the same as the thickness of the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, and the irregularities caused by the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are absorbed as the depressions thereof are filled with the softened adhesive layer <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> during the heat pressing process, whereby the irregularities are prevented from being expressed on the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. In a layered structure in which the cover layers <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> are bonded to opposite sides of the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, on which the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have been formed, so as to be integrated therewith, as described above, the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> are opened by an excimer laser process, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0437&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present example, a groove-shaped depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> having a depth <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of 200 &mgr;m or less is formed across the entire width of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> in the area of the row of toner passage holes of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, and the head interval is ensured by the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. Thus, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> contacts the toner layer on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> in each contact area <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> on the upstream side and the downstream side of the toner holder with respect to the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> The depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is formed by heat-pressing the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> by using a die of a predetermined shape, which has been heated through a heat press process, so as to heat-set the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. The shape and dimension of the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, particularly the step shape on each wall surface, can be optimally set by the shape of the die. Specifically, it is preferred that the groove depth <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is 10 &mgr;m, and at least the wall surface on the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction is a slope with a ridge portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being rounded. Moreover, the heating temperature in the heat set process is suitably <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>&deg; C. Moreover, when heat-pressing the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, it is preferred that not only the area in which the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is to be formed and the vicinity thereof, but also the surrounding area (specifically, the area including the contact areas <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which the toner layer on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is contacted), are pressed at once by the die simultaneously with the formation of the depressed portion. This is because of the following reason. If only the area in which the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is to be formed and the vicinity thereof are heat-pressed, a crease or corrugation occurs in the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> in the surrounding area. In contrast, if the whole area including the surrounding area is heat-pressed, it is possible not only to prevent such a crease or corrugation, but also to improve the flatness of the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> as compared to that before the heat pressing process. Note that the toner passage holes <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> may be opened after the formation of the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the surface of the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> is subjected to a surface treatment using an antistatic material, which is not shown, and is electrically grounded. The antistatic material is preferably a boron-based antistatic polymer, which is coated to a thickness that is preferably 5 to 10 &mgr;m, and the surface resistance value is preferably 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>13 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;/&square;. Moreover, the abrasion resistance can further be improved by vapor-depositing Ni to a thickness of about 1 to 2 &mgr;m on the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. The hardness is preferably 200 Hv or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> In the image forming device as described above, when the toner supply unit <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is placed in the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, with the distance between the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the back electrode <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> being limited to a predetermined dimension, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is elastically held in the casing <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> via the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> that is suspended at the end on the downstream side, and the toner layer formed on the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> successively comes into contact with the contact areas <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> as the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> rotates. In such a state, the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> is displaced, resisting against the pressing force from the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. Thus, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, across the entire width thereof, is in close contact with the toner layer on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> in the contact area <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. At this time, the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the row of toner passage holes is spaced apart from the toner layer <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> by the depth <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, whereby the head interval is precisely maintained at a value that is greater than 0 &mgr;m and less than or equal to 200 &mgr;m (10 &mgr;m in the present example). The tension on the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> caused by the tension spring <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> is a value that is appropriately set so as to obtain an appropriate contact pressure of 0.002 to 0.02 MPa (0.2 to 2 gf/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) between the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the image forming device according to the present example, the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is provided in the area of the row of toner passage holes of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> so that the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> contacts the toner layer on the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> both on the upstream side and the downstream side in the toner holder moving direction with respect to the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. Therefore, also with the present example, it is possible to maintain the head interval to be constant. Specifically, as in Example 9, it is possible to prevent the head interval from varying when the flexural rigidity of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> changes due to the temperature, etc., and to prevent the toner flight characteristics from varying due to the variations in the head interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> Moreover, even if the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> has outer diameter variations, a cylindricity non-uniformity, or a radial runout, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> moves along the peripheral surface of the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, whereby such variations can be absorbed. In this way, the head interval at the position of the row of toner passage holes is maintained at the depth <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the recording characteristics from varying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> Next, while the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> is formed in the present example by heat-pressing the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, on which the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the pair of deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have been formed, via the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> and the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, as described above, the thickness of the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is substantially the same as that of the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, and the irregularities caused by the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the deflection electrodes <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are absorbed by the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, which is softened during the heat-pressing process, whereby the irregularities will not be expressed on the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. Therefore, on the surface closer to the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the irregularities of the control electrode <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> expressed on the surface of the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> are prevented from causing irregularities in the toner layer to cause a minute density non-uniformity in the recorded image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> Next, the present example provides the following advantages by forming the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> in the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> through a heat-pressing process on the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> using a die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> That is, the step shape on each wall surface of the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> can be optimally set by the shape of the die used for heat-pressing the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> in the formation of the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. In this way, when the toner layer enters the downstream side contact area <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the toner layer is prevented from being scratched off by the ridge portion of the wall surface step of the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, which has been scratched off, will not accumulate in the space between the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the toner holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, and a so-called &ldquo;fogging phenomenon&rdquo; in which the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is ejected from the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> during a non-image forming period will not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the step having a height of about 10 &mgr;m on each wall surface of the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> can be easily formed on the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. The shape of such a step is determined by the precision of the die used when heat-pressing the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the variations in the head interval can be further reduced as compared to a case where the head interval is limited by the spacer portions <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> formed through a screen printing process as in Example 9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is possible to eliminate an assembly operation of precisely attaching spacer portions, which are separate pieces, to the toner passage control device without deforming the spacer portions, as in the prior art, thereby preventing the number of assembly steps in mass production from increasing and the cost from increasing due to frequent misoperation. Moreover, at the same time, the positional precision of the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> with respect to the row of toner passage holes can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> Next, in the present example, when heat-pressing the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, not only the area in which the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is to be formed, but also the surrounding area, are pressed at once by a die, thereby preventing a crease or corrugation from occurring in the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> in the surrounding area during the formation of the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, while improving the flatness of the insulative base member <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> as compared to that before the heat pressing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present example provides the following advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> That is, the surface of the cover layer <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> is subjected to a surface treatment using an antistatic material, and is electrically grounded. Thus, it is possible to prevent the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from being excessively charged by the sliding movement against the toner layer, whereby it is possible to prevent the toner particles <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from electrostatically attaching to the surface of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and to prevent such excessive charging from adversely influencing the flight characteristics of the toner <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> through the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> to cause the image density, the pixel forming position, etc., to vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> Note that while the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is formed across the entire width of the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> in the example above, the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> may not be extended in a non-recording area on the outer side of each end of each row of toner passage holes in the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, where no row of toner passage holes is present. In such a case, the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> can be continuously contacted with the toner layer, thereby stably holding the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while the depressed portion <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is formed through a heat press process in the example above, if a step is formed by the heat press process, it is possible to form a step integrated with the toner passage control device <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> on the upstream side or the downstream side of the toner passage hole <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>. In such a case, effects as those described above in Example 8 or Example 2 can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an image forming device including a toner holder and a toner passage control device including a plurality of toner passage holes for controlling passage of a toner, in which a toner layer on the toner holder is prevented from being scratched, and in which it is possible to form a high-quality image with no nonuniformity or streak across the entire printing area while ensuring a required recording density under a constant voltage application condition, so as to form a high-quality image both in an initial stage of a recording operation and in a long-term use. Thus, the present invention has a high industrial applicability in that it further promotes the commercialization of image forming devices. </paragraph>
