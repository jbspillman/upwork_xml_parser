<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a new treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), namely use of rofleponide, its esters and salts. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic abdominal disease for which there is no apparent underlying structural cause. Symptoms in IBS are thought to arise from altered gastro-intestinal motility, increased visceral sensitivity or altered brain-gut modulation. The diagnosis of IBS is hampered by the absence of simple diagnostic tests. Physicians approach IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion and then base the diagnosis on certain diagnostic criteria such as abnormal discomfort and pain, bloating and disturbed defecation, see further in Gut, 1999; 45 (Suppl.2):II43, C1(Sept), Thompson et al., and Gasteroenterology 1997, vol. 112, p.2120-2137. Current treatment of IBS is mainly antispasmodics, laxatives, loperamide and antidepressants. A history of gastro-enteritis (Salmonella, Campylobacter etc.) is more commonly found in patients with IBS than in a control population and up to 30% of patients develop IBS after gastro-enteritis. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> According to the invention there is provided the use of rofleponide, its esters and salts, such as fatty acid esters e.g. rofleponide palmitate in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, particularly post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> According to the invention there is further provided a method of treating a patient suffering from irritable bowel syndrome which comprises administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of rofleponide, its esters and salts, such as fatty acid esters e.g. rofleponide palmitate.</paragraph>
</section>
</summary-of-invention>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention there is further provided a pharmaceutical formulation for use in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome wherein the active ingredient is rofleponide, its esters and salts, such as fatty acid esters e.g. rofleponide palmitate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It has now surprisingly been found that the rofleponide substance used in the present invention which has a minimal systemic effect and has a first pass metabolism of at least 99% is effective in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Compared to other very potent topical steroids rofleponide has i) unique combination of a sufficient water solubility for dissolution distribution in intestinal fluids, ii) a very high affinity for and activity at glucocorticosteroid receptors, and iii) a nearly complete first pass inactivation by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the intestinal hepatic region, giving an oral bioavailability of &lE;1%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Rofleponide is chemically named (22R)-16-alpha, 17 alpha-butylidenedioxy-6-alpha, 9alpha-difluoro-11beta,21-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When rofleponide, its esters and salts is administered orally, it is administered oesophageally, generally administered in the form of tablets, pills, capsules, syrups, powders or granules and when it is administered rectally, is in the form of suppositories or enemas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Rofleponide, its esters and salts may be administered on its own or as a pharmaceutical formulation in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, adjuvant or carrier. Particularly preferred are compositions not containing material capable of causing an adverse, e.g. an allergic reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Rofleponide, its esters and salts may be admixed with an adjuvant or a carrier. e.g. lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches such as potato starch, corn starch or amylopectin, cellulose derivatives, in an organic salts such as calcium sulphates, a binder such as gelatine or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate. calcium stearate, polyethylene glycol, waxes, paraffin, and the like, and then compressed into tablets. If coated tablets are required, the cores, prepared as described above. may be coated with a concentrated sugar solution which may contain e.g. gum arabic. gelatine, talcum, titanium dioxide, and the like. Alternatively, the tablet may be coated with a suitable polymer dissolved in a suitable organic solvent or with a polymer dispersion in water. Suitable polymers include cellulose derivatives, plyvinylpyrrolidone or acrylates. The tablet, capsule or granules, preferably has an enteric coating to allow release of the drug in the intestine, particularly the lower intestine. Suitable capsules may be prepared by using the methods described in EP-A-502092, WO 95/08323 or WO 97/27843. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For the preparation of soft gelatine capsules, the rofleponide, its esters and salts may be admixed with e.g. a vegetable oil or polyethylene glycol. Hard gelatine capsules may contain granules of the compound using the above mentioned excipients. Also liquid or semisolid formulations of the drug may be filled into hard gelatine capsules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Liquid preparations for oral application may be in the form of syrups or suspensions, for example solutions containing the active compound, the balance being sugar and/or a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol and propylene glycol. Optionally such liquid preparations may contain colouring agents, flavouring agents, saccharine and carboxy-methylcellulose as a thickening agent or other excipients known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Rofleponide, its esters and salts is preferably administered at a dosage of from 0.1 to 20 mg, more preferably from 0.5 to 10 mg, either as a single dose or in divided doses from 2 to 4 times per day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> For testing the effect of rofleponide, its esters and salts in post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome the intestinal neuromuscular dysfunction after acute nematode infection in mice are measured in accordance with the method described in Gasteroenterology 1997, vol. 133, p.1224-1232. </paragraph>
