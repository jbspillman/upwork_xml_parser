<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A valve (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) primarily designed as a float valve to control the flow of water under pressure into a cistern has an upstream chamber (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) and a downstream chamber (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). The upstream chamber (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) communicates an inlet (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) for mains water supply with outlets (<highlight><bold>17, 17</bold></highlight>A) and the downstream chamber (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) has an outlet (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) which is closed by a valve (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) when a float rises a float rod (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). A primary valve member assembly comprises a piston (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) to the downstream end of which a diaphragms (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is attached. When the secondary valve (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) is closed pressure on diaphragm (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) causes piston (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) to close the inlet (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). When the secondary valve (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) is opened by the rising float the piston (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is expelled from the inlet (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) allowing water to flow into the cistern through the upstream chamber (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an improved valve for controlling the flow of a pressurised fluid which is particularly, although not exclusively, suitable for controlling the flow of water into a storage cistern such as used in domestic and industrial water supply and sanitation systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The use of float valves for such purposes are well known but suffer a number of disadvantages such as erratic performance and failure fully to close of a valve which is urged to the valve-closed position as a float rises in a cistern due to clogging, the accretion of mineral deposits and the deterioration of sealing elements. Generally the action of such valves is not positive and they tend to remain in a partly open condition longer than is desirable as a float rises. Conventional float valves are also costly to manufacture and consequently to install. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A principal object of the present invention is to improve upon known float valves both in terms of their cost and operation. In particular the present invention aims to provide a float valve the operation of which will be positive and as near instantaneous as possible, avoiding undesirable &ldquo;trickle&rdquo; when water in the cistern has reached the desired level. Another object of the invention is to provide a float valve which is &ldquo;fail safe&rdquo; in that the assembly will normally close the water supply until opened by the descent of the float, in contrast to conventional arrangements in which the valve is biassed to the open position and closed only when the float rises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention there is provided a valve for controlling flow of a pressurised fluid, the valve comprising an upstream chamber having an inlet and an outlet, the inlet being communicable with a source of fluid under pressure, a downstream chamber in communication with the upstream chamber and having an outlet, a primary valve member which is movable between positions closing and opening communication between the inlet and outlet of the upstream chamber and a secondary valve member which is movable between positions closing and opening the upstream chamber, the primary valve member having associated therewith upstream and downstream control surfaces of unequal cross sectional area of which the control surface of greater cross sectional area is exposed to the downstream chamber and the arrangement being such that when the secondary valve member opens the outlet of the downstream chamber the primary valve member is urged to its open position by fluid pressure on the control surface of lesser cross sectional area thereby communicating the inlet of the upstream chamber with the outlet thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The secondary valve member may be a float valve adapted to control flow of water into a cistern, wherein the outlet of the upstream chamber opens vertically and the secondary valve member is movable up and down by a rod to which a float is attached, the secondary valve member opening and closing the outlet of the upstream chamber according to the level of water in the cistern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The said rod may be raised by the float to close the secondary valve member when water in the cistern rises to, a predetermined level or lowered by the weight of the float to open the secondary valve member when water in the cistern falls below a predetermined level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The rod is preferably generally vertical in use and preferably has stops along its length between which the float is movable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The primary valve member may be a piston reciprocable in a bore which connects the upstream and downstream chambers and may be attached to a diaphragm spanning the upstream side of the downstream chamber and constituting said control surface of greater cross sectional area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The diaphragm is preferably sandwiched between support plates which, together with the diaphragm, are secured to the downstream end of the piston by a screw formed with a coaxial bore, the screw engaging in a coaxial bore of the piston thereby communicating the upstream and downstream chambers of the valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A compression spring may be provided which acts between the downstream side of the downstream chamber and the diaphragm to bias the piston to the valve-closed position of the primary valve member.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A valve body <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> comprises components <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A and l<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B held together by a circumferential array of screws <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The component <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>B has a coaxial inlet connection <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for connection to a source of water under pressure (not shown) and within the component <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>B is an upstream chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in communication with two outlet spouts <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A. Within the component <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A is a downstream chamber <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which has a vertical outlet opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A hollow relief body <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is screwed into the outlet opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to provide a seat for a secondary valve <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with the interposition of an O-ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The secondary valve <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is connected by a stem <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a clamping block <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is also secured to the upper end of a float rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is movable vertically in a bore <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the back of the valve body portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A. At a position below the valve body <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> the float rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has stops <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> adjustably secured to it by screws <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and between these stops <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> a float body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is movable along the float rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Within the valve body <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is a coaxial bore <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> connecting the upstream chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with the downstream chamber <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and aligned with the inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A primary valve member in the form of a piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is reciprocable in the bore <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> between positions in which its upstream end closes the inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and in which it withdraws toward the upstream chamber <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, thus opening communication between the inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the outlet spouts <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A through the upstream chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A diaphragm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is trapped between the components <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>B of the valve body and spans the upstream side of the downstream chamber <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The diaphragm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between support plates <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which are clamped to the upstream end of the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by an equalisation screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which makes a screw threaded connection with the upstream end of a coaxial bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> also has a coaxial bore and by this means the downstream chamber <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the valve is constantly in communication with the inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> whatever the position of the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A compression spring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> biasses the assembly of diaphragm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, support plates <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> toward the valve-closed position of the latter, in which the upstream end of the piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> shuts off communication between the inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the spouts <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In use the valve <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is mounted in a cistern (not shown) with the float rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> depending vertically into the cistern. The stops <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are adjusted along the length of the float rod to determine at what water levels within the cistern the valve <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> will operate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the cistern is at first empty the weight of the float <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and float rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will hold the valve <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> open. Water is free to flow through the secondary valve opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so that water pressure acting on the upstream end of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will displace the latter to the valve-open position in which water can flow from the inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through both spouts <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to fill the cistern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When the water level in the cistern has risen sufficiently to cause the float <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to lift the upper stop <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and with it the float rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the secondary valve <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> will be seated, closing the outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the downstream chamber. Pressure in downstream chamber <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will therefore rise until it equals pressure in inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, but because the cross sectional area of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is substantially greater than the cross sectional area of the upstream end of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> the latter will be urged to the valve-closed position in which it shuts off communication between inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the spouts <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A. This position will be maintained until a drop in the water level in the cistern causes the float <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> once again to unseat the secondary valve <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, whereupon the primary valve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will re-open. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent that many modifications of the above described embodiment are possible. Features which have been described and illustrated because they are currently considered desirable are not essential, such as the provision of the spring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, two spouts <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and the adjustable stops <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the float rod. The spring <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be dispensed with and the upstream chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may have one outlet or more than two outlets. The float may be rigidly fixed to the float rod. It is not essential that the float rod should be vertical. It might have a hinged connection to the valve body <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and extend therefrom at an angle to the vertical, being pivotally connected to the stem <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the secondary valve <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Clearly the valve body <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> could be of a different construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Neither is the provision of a diaphragm such as <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> considered to be essential. All that is necessary is that the cross sectional area of the primary valve member presented to the upstream chamber is greater than that presented to the inlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Although designed as a float valve for use in controlling the water level in a cistern the valve of the invention is considered to have utility in controlling the flow of any pressurised fluid, such as a gas, in conditions in which it is appropriate to rely upon incoming pressure to maintain the primary valve member in the valve-closed position. </paragraph>
