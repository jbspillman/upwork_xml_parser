<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a debris collection device for collecting dirt. debris and the like that is particularly useful when used in conjunction with rotary drills. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> When drilling into surfaces using a standard rotary drill, the material drilled out of the surface is normally carried back along the length of the drill and scattered as granular dust or grit in the area directly below where the hole is being drilled. In some cases the quantity of debris generated by drilling a hole is particularly noticeable, for instance, a 10 mm hole at a 5 cm depth will create nearly 4 cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>of debris that will be scattered about the immediate area, the majority forming a pile immediately below the hole. Whilst in many industrial environments such debris would be unnoticeable, this is not the case in the home. Particularly in the DIY environment, the house-proud occupant and/or their spouse are likely to require sheeting to be put down in the vicinity around the drilling and for the area to be vacuumed immediately afterwards to avoid making the house dirty with the dust and debris. Furthermore, tables and ornaments must either be covered or removed unless they are to be thoroughly cleaned afterwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A related complaint is often raised against service installers (telecommunications and cable TV installers in particular) who drill many holes at a customers house to install their services, but rarely clean up after themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In many circumstances it is highly desirable for the dust and debris failing from a drilling operation to be completely collected without large amounts of preparation by laving sheets and alike In particular, in installing fixtures in a newly decorated room or drilling, holes near sensitive electronic equipment that cannot easily, be moved and the debris may be potentially damaging to the equipment, a simple debris collection mechanism should be desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Other than using sheeting to catch the majority of the debris, no simple and inexpensive mechanisms for controlling the spread of such debris is known to be available to small-scale installation operators or to the home DIY market. Complex systems involving vacuums to suck away the dust have been developed over the years, but this usually requires additional vacuum pumps and ducting, and the vacuum is rarely powerful enough to carry all the dust and debris away. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> UK patent publication number 2278190 discloses a hand tool for use with a drill. The hand tool includes a hollow body of solid construction having a through hole through which a drill bit may pass. The hand tool is held against a surface to be drilled using a handle and during drilling debris from drilling passes into the hollow body. Such a tool partially solves the problems of capturing dust and debris created while drilling. However, the tool requires a hand to hold it to the wall leaving only one hand to hold and guide a drill which for many people is not enough. If a heavy drill is used or the user needs two hands to hold or guide the drill, a further person would have to be involved to use the hand tool. The tool is only usable if drilling is perpendicular to the surface to be drilled due to the alignment of the through holes and solid body. In addition, the user&apos;s hand is close to the drill bit when drilling which may prove to be unsafe. Furthermore, having a solid body exposes the hand tool to wear around the portions that contact the drill bit. This is addressed by use of a chuck-impact ring shield or washer in the above document. However, the use of a combination of parts, some of which must be removable and replaceable increases the complexity and overall cost of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Statement of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a collection device for use with a drill to capture debris ejected from drilling into a surface comprising a body formed of flexible material having a first, substantially flat, configuration and a second, erect, configuration defining a cavity, a hole for receiving a drill bit into the cavity when the body is erect and adhesive means for adhering the body to the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In use the device envelops the portions of the drill bit that carry dust and debris out of the drilled hole. The body is temporarily fixed to the surface such that there is a seal between the body and the surface so that ejected dust, debris and the like has no choice other than to pass into the cavity. Preferably the seal is immediately around the area to be drilled so that no dust is trapped between the body and the surface. In the cavity, the dust and debris either falls off the drill bit into the cavity for collection or is pushed off the surface of the drill bit into the cavity as it reaches the back of the body. The device of the present invention is a simple yet effective construction which may be easily mass produced. Furthermore, depending on the material of construction, the device may be fully re-usable or used a number of times before disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> By being temporarily fixed to the surface, the device allows the user&apos;s attention and both hands to be used in holding and directing the drilling. Thus, the device solves the problem of capturing dust and debris without increasing the complexity of the drilling action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The device is supplied in a substantially flattened or flat-packed state that can be opened or otherwise erected to form the cavity prior to, or during use. The flattened or flat-packed device requires minimal packaging for sale and allows the device to be pressed against the surface to attach it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The first surface may include a number of tabs for use in pulling the first surface away from the second surface to thereby form the cavity. Preferably, the first surface includes two tabs, the tabs being on opposing sides of the through hole. The tabs may form part of a reinforcing portion around the through hole. In order to make devices of cheap, lightweight, material the reinforcing portion, possibly formed as a separate layer, may be arranged around the through hole to counter wear and tear from rubbing of the drill bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The joint between the first surface and the second surface may be openable to enable the cavity to be emptied. Alternatively, the body may include a re-sealable opening to enable the cavity to be emptied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The attachment means preferably comprises an adhesive layer such as double sided sticky tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The adhesive layer may include a removable cover for protection of the adhesive when not in use. The body may comprise one of rubber, plastics, reinforced paper/or silicone-based paper.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are, respectively, front and rear views of a collection device according to the present invention. The collection device comprises a body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a front surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a back surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The front and back surfaces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are joined to each other around their perimeters (the joint is marked by a dash-dot line) to form an enclosed central area <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> The front surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a through hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> capable of accepting a drill bit. The through hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably smaller or of the same diameter as the intended drill bit to be used. However, the size of the through hole is not essential to the operation of the device. In practice, a device with a 10 mm hole is used for all drill bits without adverse effect. Equally spaced either side of the through hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are two tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> attached to the front surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The back surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an adhesive area <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> permitting adhesion of the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a collection device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> when in use. To use the collection device, the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is adhered to a surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> such that the through hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in line with the hole to be drilled. The tip of a drill bit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (only part of the length of the drill bit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shown) is pressed against back surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via through hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are pulled in the direction away from the surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The pulling action forces the hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to expand around the circumference of the drill bit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the front surface to separate from the back surface to form a cavity <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the device may be adhered to the surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) ad erected using the tabs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> prior to insertion of the drill bit. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>&prime; is the cross-sectional drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shorting the collected debris. During the drilling operation, a part of the back surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and adhesive area <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is drilled away and the drill then enters the surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Due to the remaining seal between the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, dust and debris <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> ejected from drilling into the surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> drops from the drill bit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> Into the cavity <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Once drilling is completed, the body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is removed from the surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and can be emptied for further use or disposed of. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The body may be formed from a flexible material that can be flattened but retains its shape when erected. Suitable materials include greaseproof paper, reinforced paper, coated paper, cardboard or silicone-based paper. The adhesive area <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be formed from pre-adhered double sided sticky tape or other suitable adhesive. Preferably the adhesive area is screen printed onto the body and a suitable cover is then applied to preserve the adhesive until required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The material forming the tabs ma be part of the body or may be attached to the body. If the material is attached to the body, it may also extend around the through hole to reinforce it. The tabs may be formed as semi-circles or a circle extending around the hole so that they can be grasped from any orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The size of the body and the cavity it can form will largely depend on the size of the target hole to be drilled, as will the strength of the body of the material. The joint around the circumference of the surfaces may be releasable and re-sealable by way of adhesive, velcro, a zip fastening or the like for the body to be emptied. Alternatively, the body may include a re-sealable opening, such as a zip opening or the like described above, away from the joint permitting the body to be emptied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The body need not be a two dimensional constriction, forced into three dimensions upon use, instead it could be a three dimensional construction having a shape such as a cuboid, pyramid, or frusto-cone that is folded or otherwise flattened or flat-packed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The body may be fixed to the surface to be drilled by adhesive applied to be body, double sided sticky tape, gum or similar adhesive materials. Alternatively, suction or some other form of non-marking attachment means may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A hole may be pre-formed in the back surface for the drill to pass into the surface or it may be formed the first time the device is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although drilling perpendicular to the surface is illustrated, it will be appreciated that drilling at any angle to the surface can be accommodated by the collection device of the present invention merely by changing the angle at which the drill bit is inserted into the collection device. </paragraph>
