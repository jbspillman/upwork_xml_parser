<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An electronic health consultation method. Vital data indicative of a health state and photographed images of meals are input by a health advisee&apos;s client and saved in a server. A dietician&apos;s client views the electronic images of the meals, communicates the results of analysis to the health advisee&apos;s client, and stores them in the server. On the health advisee&apos;s vital data and the results of analysis of the health advisee&apos;s meals carried out by the dietician, the server determines whether or not the health advisee is healthy. If the health advisee is determined to be abnormal, this is communicated to a doctor&apos;s client. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electronic health consultation method using a communication network such as the Internet to efficiently connect a medical staff and a health advisee together. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> At present, a medical team (including a medical staff of a doctor, a nurse, a dietician, a sports therapist, and others) treats health advisees who have chronic diseases such as diabetes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, to actualize this team health care, the medical staff must be confined to hospitals, thereby requiring a long time and a large amount of expenses. Accordingly, an object of the team health care is to provide excellent team health care for an increasing number of health advisees who have chronic diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> At present, if a health advisee visits a hospital and a doctor diagnoses the advisee by checking the advisee&apos;s blood sugar level, hemoglobin A1C, and urine, taking an electrocardiogram of the advisee, and carrying out other medical checks, and then determines from the results that the advisee requires health advice, then in the hospital, the medical staff discusses a treatment plan for the health advisee, gives the advisee detailed instructions for chronic diseases such as diabetes, specifically, the conceptual problems of the chronic diseases and practical self-management, and interviews the advisee about once a month to check his progress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, presently, in order to eliminate the need for the health advisee to visit a hospital, the following methods are known by which the advisee can utilize the Internet to consult the doctor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to a first method, the health advisee transmits an electronic mail from a personal computer installed in the advisee&apos;s home to a personal computer installed in a hospital. The electronic mail describes the contents of health consultation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to a second method, the health advisee uses a personal computer in the advisee&apos;s home to access home pages that advertise pharmaceutical manufacturers in order to find descriptions relating to the advisee&apos;s symptoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A problem of the first method is that many health questions can be answered by a dietician instead of a doctor, so that if the doctor must handle a large number of consultations by himself or herself, the doctor does not have much time to execute his or her primary medical operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A problem of the second problem is that since the health advisee, who does not have much medical knowledge, must diagnose himself or herself, precise diagnoses are impossible. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a new electronic health consultation method that can provide excellent team health care for an increasing number of health advisees without increasing a burden on the medical staff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide an electronic health consultation server, an electronic health consultation client, and a medical staff client which are suitable for health consultations using the electronic health consultation method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a health support system comprising clients installed on a health advisee side and on a medical staff side and a server, the clients and the server being connected together via a network, the system comprising the steps of allowing the health advisee to store data about the advisee&apos;s health in the server via the advisee&apos;s client, storing, in the server, the results of an analysis of the data about the advisee&apos;s health stored in the server and allowing the data stored in the server to be shared via the client(s) of the health advisee and/or medical staff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the data about the health advisee&apos;s health may be data in electronic images of the health advisee&apos;s meals. The analysis results may be data about nutritional analysis of the meals obtained by the medical staff by visually checking the electronic image data of the meals. That is, a net dietician system is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the health advisee can input his or her own nutritional analysis of the electronic images of the meals through the advisee&apos;s client. The client can display both nutritional analysis data input by the health advisee and nutritional analysis data input by the medical staff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the nutritional analysis data input from the health advisee&apos;s client may be transferred to and stored in the server, so that the server automatically compares the nutritional analysis data input by the medical staff &apos;s client and stored in the server with the nutritional analysis data input by the health advisee&apos;s client and stored in the server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the results of the comparison by the server may be communicated to at least the health advisee&apos;s client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the electronic images stored in the server and advice on the results of the analysis may be provided by the medical staff &apos;s client directly to the health advisee&apos;s client or via the server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention is characterized in that the health advisee&apos;s vital data is input from the advisee&apos;s client and transferred to and stored in the server, and the server determines on the basis of a predetermined determination rule whether or not either the transferred vital data or the results of analysis of the meals are indicative of an abnormality of the advisee&apos;s health, so that if a result of the determination indicates abnormality, this is communicated to a client of a predetermined related person, the client being connected to the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention is characterized in that the settings of the determination rule used by the server can be changed for each health advisee by the medical staff &apos;s client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a communication method for notifying the related person&apos;s client that an abnormality has been indicated may be chosen from a plurality of predetermined communication methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the readout of the vital data stored in the server may be limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the medical staff includes a doctor and a dietitian, and the health analysis data may be input from each of the doctor&apos;s and dietitian&apos;s clients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the health advisee&apos;s client may input a reservation for a health consultation with the medical staff, to the server, and the server may notify the medical staff&apos;s client of the input reservation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the medical staff&apos;s client may notify, via the server, the health advisee&apos;s client of health consultation dates and times that are inconvenient to the medical staff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, advice on the health consultation between the medical staff and the health advisee may be transferred from the medical staff &apos;s client directly to the health advisee&apos;s client or via the server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the network has a meal delivery service provider&apos;s client connected thereto so that the health advisee&apos;s or medical staff&apos;s client can order a meal or ingredients via the server or the meal delivery service provider&apos;s client can deliver a recipe via the server. The delivery of a recipe means that a meal menu suitable for the health advisee is provided.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the configuration of a health consultation system to which the present invention has been applied. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, clients <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are connected to a communication network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The clients and server may be commercially available computers having pointing devices such as a keyboard and a mouse as well as communication functions, so that the configuration of the hardware is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The client <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed in a health advisee&apos;s home. Further, the client <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also be composed of a PAD (portable digital assistant) or a cellular phone with a camera. The client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used by a doctor and installed in a hospital or home. The client <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is installed in a dietician&apos;s home or company. The client <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is installed in a meal delivery service provider&apos;s office. The server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is installed in a computer center. The client <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is installed in a sports club facility where a sports instructor inputs a training menu for the health advisee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The clients <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are equipped with a program called a &ldquo;browser&rdquo; and used to browse home pages (HTML, XML, or other documents). The clients <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are equipped with a program for a video telephone (also referred to as a &ldquo;video conference&rdquo;) and have a video camera for a video telephone connected thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides home pages for health consultations. In this embodiment, the health advisee uses the client <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to access a home page and inputs information about his or her health consultation. The input information includes data indicative of the advisee&apos;s health such as photographed images of the foods of the advisee&apos;s meals and measurements of the advisee&apos;s blood pressure, which data will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The input information is stored in the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for the advisee. In the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the measurements such as blood pressure are compared with preset permissible values, and if any of the measurements exceeds the corresponding permissible value, the appropriate message is automatically communicated to the hospital client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the advisee&apos;s client <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by electronic mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The dietician&apos;s client <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> accesses the home page of the center server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to visually analyze the meals of the advisee, who receives the dietician&apos;s guidance. More specifically, the dietician&apos;s client <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> reads out the image file of the photographed meals transmitted by the health advisee and then stored in the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and displays the file. On the basis of this display, the dietician analyzes the contents of the meals and inputs and registers the results of the analysis in the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The registered analysis result is compared with the corresponding permissible value in the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and if it exceeds the permissible value, the appropriate message is automatically communicated to the hospital client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the advisee&apos;s client <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by electronic mail. </paragraph>

Operating a registration button <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> causes the reserved date and time to be registered in the other-information database. In this respect, on the basis of a schedule registered by the doctor, the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> notifies the health advisee of dates and times available for reservations and those unavailable. The health advisee can cancel the reservation using a cancel button <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight> and return to the screen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> using a return button <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Reference numeral <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight> denotes an area in which the schedule of the selected item is displayed. When the medical staff operates a registration button <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight>, the appointed date and time are transmitted from the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, where it is registered in the other-information database. The medical staff can cancel the input reservation using a cancel button <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight>. When the health advisee makes a reservation using a health consultation reservation accepting and browsing function of the gateway program, the unavailable dates and times are transmitted from the other-information database to the health advisee&apos;s client <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Further, the health advisee&apos;s reserved date and time registered in the other-information database of the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the doctor&apos;s client and displayed in a schedule information display selecting section <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. In this manner, the schedule is coordinated between the doctor and the health advisee so that on the reserved day, a video conference can be executed directly between the health advisee&apos;s client <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the doctor&apos;s client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using a video telephone program. The video telephone is well known, and detailed description thereof is thus unnecessary. A return button <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight> can be used to return to the screen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows a screen for electronic health consultations using the video telephone and displayed by operating the corresponding one of the function buttons in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. After the conference has been completed, the return button can be used to return to the screen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above described display screens, a screen appears which is used to request a delivery of a meal by operating the corresponding one of the function buttons in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. When using this screen, foods for the meal are selected and destination information is input, the selected meal name and the destination information are transferred directly to the client <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or via the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The meal delivery service provider delivers the meal to the health advisee on the basis of the transferred information (the name of the meal or the names of the ingredients). The health advisee&apos;s client <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may transfer the information to the delivery service provider&apos;s client <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by electronic mail or via the other-information database of the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As described above, in this embodiment, the following can be achieved: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> (1) The dietician analyzes electronic images of meals stored by the health advisee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> (2) The health advisee learns how to analyze meals by comparing the advisee&apos;s own analysis of means with the dietician&apos;s analysis of the same meals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> (3) The server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> automatically checks vital data stored by the health advisee and the results of analysis of electronic images of the health advisee&apos;s meals stored by the dietician, and communicates these data to the health advisee and the doctor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (4) The doctor sets determination rules and criteria for the automatic health check for each health advisee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> (5) A reservation schedule is coordinated between the doctor and the dietician and the health advisee so that on the basis of this schedule, a health consultation can be carried out using the video telephone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> (6) If the health advisee is determined to be abnormal as a result of the process in (4) and if it is determined as a result of the video conference that advice should be transmitted to the health advisee, then the medical staff transmits the appropriate advice to the health advisee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Thus, the health advisee can receive the appropriate health advice, and the doctor needs to transmit advice to the health advisee only when required, and thus has an increased amount of time available for treatment operations in the hospital. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in this embodiment, the health advisee can request meals to be delivered to the advisee&apos;s home. This is very convenient to those health advisees who cannot go out. Further, the health advisee can receive meals or ingredients ordered directly with the delivery service provider by the dietician to maintain and improve the advisee&apos;s health state according to the expert&apos;s guidance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention can implement the following embodiments: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> 1) In the above embodiment, the dietician or doctor consulted by the health advisee is notified of the health advisee&apos;s name by a system administrator by phone or electronic mail. However, by providing the server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with a table containing the correspondences between health advisees&apos; user IDs and dieticians&apos; and doctors&apos; user IDs, the information communication between the dietician&apos;s client and the doctor&apos;s client can be automated, thereby simplifying operations that must be performed by each person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> For example, when the dietician is to display images of meals transmitted by the health advisee, on the dietician&apos;s client, the dietician must specify this health advisee&apos;s name using the list of health advisees. However, with the above mentioned correspondence table, the dietician can cause an automatic transmission of only the images transmitted from those health advisees who are assigned to the dietician and is thus released from operations required to read out the images. Further, since the images transmitted from those health advisees who are not assigned to the dietician are not displayed, the privacy of the health advisees is guarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> 2) In the above described embodiment, the direct communication between the health advisee and the doctor is carried out over the video telephone. However, of course, voice mails or normal telephones may be used for communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> 3) The above described display screens are only examples for description, and the arrangements or shapes of the buttons and the arrangements or sizes of the display areas are not limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> 4) In the above described embodiment, a notice of or advice on the results of analysis of meals from the dietician to the doctor or health advisee is displayed on the home page. However, such a notice can be given by electronic mail or displayed directly on the client or the health advisee&apos;s communication equipment using a well-known communication method. For example, a telephone, facsimile terminal equipment, or an electronic mail may be used. Further, a direct notice from the server may be given by phone, facsimile, or electronic mail. Furthermore, the doctor may give advice directly to the health advisee, and this communication may be carried out using a method other than the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> 5) In the above described embodiment, a health consultation is reserved over the video telephone. However, it should be appreciated that a health consultation may be reserved by phone or any of the other remote communication methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> 6) The medical staff, as used herein, refers to those who are engaged in health care including a doctor, a nurse, a dietician, and a sports therapist (including a sports instructor). Further, the health advisee, as used herein, refers to the health advisee as well as his or her family members and other related people. The client, as used herein, may be any information processing equipment having communication functions, including, for example, a personal computer, a workstation, and a television with an Internet connection function. The network, as used herein, includes a LAN, a WAN, a VAN, a public telephone network, a CATV network, and any other networks. When the client is to be connected to the server, this connection may be established via a network connection company such as a provider. Further, the predetermined people involved in notices include not only the health advisee and doctor but also the health advisee&apos;s family members, doctors of emergency medical institutions, and other related people. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> 7) Readout of vital data, electronic images of meals, and the results of analysis thereof is limited to the health advisee and his or her family members, doctors of emergency medical institutions, and other related people. The readout may be limited using a normal method such as the user ID and password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Many variations other than the above described embodiments are possible. However, these variations fall within the technical scope of the present invention as long as they are based on the technical concepts described in the claims. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the dietician can give health advice online, thereby reducing a burden on the doctor. Further, the doctor can obtain the results of analysis of meals from the dietician and thus reference them when giving advice to the health advisee. Furthermore, the doctor can compare his or her own analysis of the meals with the dietician&apos;s analysis to improve his or her meal analysis ability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to the present invention, advice from the dietician is transferred to the health advisee online so that the health advisee can consult with the dietician on the advisee&apos;s health at home. Furthermore, since previously registered photographed images of meals are saved in the server, the health advisee can check the photographed images of the meals at any time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, since the server automatically executes health examinations on the basis of vital data, the burden on the doctor is reduced. The discriminates for abnormality are set for each health advisee by the doctor, thereby enabling appropriate health examinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the present invention, if the health advisee is determined to be abnormal, one of the plurality of communication methods can be selected which is suitable for the doctor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to the present invention, the doctor can transmit advice to the health advisee, and in this case, the doctor can reference the vital data saved in the server. Further, a schedule for a health consultation can be remotely coordinated between the health advisee and the doctor, thereby eliminating the need for the health advisee to visit the hospital until the advisee is instructed by the doctor to do so. </paragraph>
