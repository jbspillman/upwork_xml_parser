<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a shoe clip and, in particular, a shoe clip for attachment of articles to the laces, straps or other fastening devices of a shoe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is often desired to attach small components, such as coins, keys, identification race chips, computational devices and/or electronic devices to the laces, straps or like devices of boots, sandals, running-shoes and so forth. Hereinafter, the various types of shoes will be included in the term &ldquo;shoe&rdquo; and the various types of laces, straps and so forth will be included in the term &ldquo;laces.&rdquo; The attaching of the components to the shoe in this manner relieves the user from carrying the components in his or her hand or carrying the components in various pockets. For some components, such as, the race chip or certain computational devices or electronic devices, attachment to the shoe is required for the proper functioning of the component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Prior known shoe attachment mechanisms consist mainly of simple shoe lace tie-in devices that have lace holes built into them. To use the devices, the user unlaces the shoe lace from three or four eyelets, runs the lace through the lace holes of the attachment mechanism and then re-runs the lace through the eyelets. This method is particularly bothersome, however, because the shoe must be continuously unlaced and laced when the device is placed on or taken off of the shoe. Further, the fit of the shoe may be adversely affected if the laced sides of the shoe do not compensate for the extra bulk of the attached components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Other known attachment mechanisms, such as Velcro loops, do not provide a sufficiently rigid connection between the component and the laces. Accordingly, the component moves around on the laces when a user moves, and the movement of the component may thus distract the user or adversely affect the performance of the device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention is a shoe clip that includes two releasably and/or rotatably attached members that essentially grip the laces, to position the clip on the shoe. A first member is shaped and sized to slide under one or more laces of the shoe, without requiring unlacing thereof. A second member attaches at one end to the first member. After insertion of the first member underneath the laces, the second member is positioned over the first member, such that the laces are held between the two members. The members may then fasten to one another at or near their free ends, such that the members grip the laces relatively tightly between them. The second member supports or is integral with the component that is to be attached to the shoe. The clip thus holds component in position on the laces such that the movement of the component relative to the laces is minimized.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that laced or strapped footwear including, for example, boots, sandals and running shoes are collectively referred hereinafter as shoes. Further, the term laces as used hereinafter includes straps and other like devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the shoe clip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a second member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that are rotatably connected at first ends <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by a hinge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The hinge is disposed to permit the second member to rotate away from the first member, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and to a position that overlays the first member, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Co-acting sections <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of a fastening device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as, for example, a catch or a snap, are positioned on free ends <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the members. The fastening device releasably secures the second member in the position in which it overlays the first member. In this closed position, the members then grip the one or more laces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The second member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be formed integral with a component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such as a pouch, race clip or electronic device, as depicted in the drawing. Alternatively, the component may be supported by the second member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the free end <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> extends outwardly and is sized and shaped to receive the free end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the second member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The free end of the second member includes an outwardly extending tab <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> that is sized to catch against a lip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the shaped end of the first member when the clip is in the closed position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The lip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> prevents the second member from rotating away from the laces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The shoe clip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may instead be positioned on the shoe with the free ends facing the toe of the shoe. Further, the tab <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may extend outwardly from the free end of the first member and be received by the free end of the second member. Alternatively, the tab <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and shaped end may be fashioned as a snap, with the tab extending upwardly or downwardly, as appropriate. The hinge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be releasable, such that the members may be pulled apart as opposed to or in addition to rotating relative to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the receiving end of member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be further shaped to receive the tab <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in any one of a number of indents <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, each with a projecting lip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The second member may thus be held selectably closer to or further from the first member depending on the thickness of the laces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. With the first member in position over the second, the user pushes the first member toward the second member until the tab <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> rests in an appropriate indent <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, such that the members then grip the laces relatively tightly and hold the component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> securely and rigidly in position on the shoe. Alternatively, the clip may include multiple tabs <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and one or more receiving indents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> To facilitate sliding the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> beneath the laces, the laces may be loosened. The laces, however, need not and, indeed, should not be unlaced. When the laces are thereafter tightened and tied, the first member is rotated and fastened, to hold the component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rigidly in place. As discussed, the free end of the one of the members may include multiple indents <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> for receiving the free end of the other member such that the grip on the laces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be selectively tightened to accommodate the thickness of the laces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes at its free end <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> a cross bar <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> that has two shaped ends <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The shaped ends engage tabs <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight> that extend outwardly on either side of the second member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The shaped ends may include multiple slots <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> for receiving the tabs <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight>, such that the grip of the members can be adjusted around the laces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The hinge <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is shown as including two pivot points <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> that engage indents <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the end <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the second member. The second member then rotates relative to the first member about the pivot points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the two members may releasably attach at their ends <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, with points <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> being received in the indents <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>when the second member is positioned to overlay the first member. The ends <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may instead be held together magnetically with one or both of the points the indents being magnetized. Further the tabs may extend inwardly from the arms <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, with the indents <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> being located on the outside of the ends <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the crossbar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> depict the shoe clip <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> with a spring hinge <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> that rotatably connects the first and second members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The free ends of the members fasten together with the receiving end <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second member engaging a tab <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight> on the end of the first member. A lip <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> holds the receiving end of the second member against movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A user positions the clip <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> on the shoe by pressing the hinged ends <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> together such that the members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> separate, against the urging of the spring hinge <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. The user then slides the first member under the laces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while holding the hinged ends against further relative movement of the members. The user then releases the hinged ends and one or both of the members move in accordance with the urging of the spring hinge, until the second member overlies the first member. As appropriate, the user pushes the second member closer to the first member to engage the free ends <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the shoe clip of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be one-piece and U-shaped, with legs <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> that form the first and second members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a closed end <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> that acts as a spring-controlled hinge. The legs or members are mechanically stressed such that they apply pressure to one another in accordance with the urging of the spring-controlled end <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>. A user thus pulls the free ends <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the legs slightly apart and slides the clip onto the laces, with one leg beneath the laces and one leg above the laces. The user then releases the legs, and the legs move in accordance with the urging of the hinge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to clamp onto the laces. The members thus tightly grip the laces between them, to hold the component rigidly in place on the laces. The free ends of the legs may also fasten together with any of the catches, snaps and so forth discussed above. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, the shoe clip of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is depicted with an additional elasticized retainer band <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight>. The band attaches at one end <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> to the member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> adjacent to the hinge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As depicted in the drawing, the end <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> includes a first opening <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> that slides over the end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the first member. The band <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> includes a second, elongated opening <highlight><bold>954</bold></highlight> that essentially separates the band into two sections <highlight><bold>956</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>956</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>along much of the length of the band, leaving a tab <highlight><bold>955</bold></highlight> as the free end of the band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> When the shoe clip is in the closed position, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the user stretches the retainer band <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> over the component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such that the end <highlight><bold>953</bold></highlight> of the opening <highlight><bold>954</bold></highlight> fits over a shaped end <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The shaped end <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes an outwardly extending projection <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> that retains the end <highlight><bold>955</bold></highlight> of the band <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> in position over the component. With the clip in the closed position, a section <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> of the band essentially protects the component, should the user kick or trip over something. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The elasticized retainer band <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> may also aid in holding the component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in place relative to the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> particularly if the fastening device should fail. The shoe clip has several distinct advantages over the previously discussed shoe attachment devices. Two such advantages are: (i) the laces do not need to be unlaced when attaching or removing the device; and (ii) the attached device has a secure and rigid fit on the shoe because of the manner in which the members of the clip grip the laces between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Numerous modifications, variations and adaptations may be made to the particular embodiments of the invention described above without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims. As discussed, the free ends of the members may be closest to the tie ends of the laces or to the toe of the shoe, the hinge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be a catch, a pivot, a spring, releasable and/or rotational. Further the two members may be legs of a one-piece U-shaped clip or may be separate pieces that releasably and/or rotatably attach to one another at the hinged end. Further, the fastening device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the free ends of the members may be a tab and one or more indent combination, a catch, snap or velcro fastener and the like, that holds the free ends of the device in a position in which the members to grip the laces between them and hold the component against movement relative to the laces. </paragraph>
