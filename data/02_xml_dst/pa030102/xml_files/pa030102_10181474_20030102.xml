<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a circuit for splitting or joining radio-frequency powers as claimed in the precharacterizing clause of claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Circuits for splitting or joining radio-frequency powers are known, for example, as so-called bridge circuits or as Wilkinson couplers and are used in particular for connecting radio-frequency transmitters or antennas in parallel, in radio-frequency technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A circuit of this generic type for splitting and joining radio-frequency powers has been disclosed, for example, in the prospectus Kathrein-Werke KG &ldquo;Base Station Antennas for Mobile Communication, catalog 03.99&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The circuit is arranged, for example, in an elongated housing on one of whose end faces the so-called sum port (input) can be provided and on whose opposite end, for example, a first individual port can be provided, and the second individual port can be provided on a transverse face, adjacent to this end face, but at right angles to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The power is split by means of different resistances at the individual port (different individual port resistances connected in parallel). The first individual port in this case remains unchanged. The second individual port is in this case subjected, for example, to &lgr;/4 transformation. In other words, the power split according to the prior art is provided by means of a different impedance z (&ldquo;&lgr;/4 transformation&rdquo;). The power division in this case produces a reaction on the input, however. In particular, if the division ratios differ, they cannot be set such that they are variable, so that different types and appliances must be provided for the different power division ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A circuit for splitting or joining radio-frequency powers is known from U.S. Pat. No. 3,324,421, in which a main line is connected between an input port and first output port, and a branch line branches off from the main line at a branching point. An adjustable output element is provided in this circuit, which determines the magnitude of the power tapped off by varying the capacitance of a capacitor which is connected in the branch line. Depending on the measurement frequency, the output element can in this way be adapted over a narrow bandwidth, that is to say only the measurement branch is adapted. This output element causes reactions on the impedance of the main line, however, especially at relatively high frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is known from U.S. Pat No. 2,657,362 for, for example, the impedance of an antenna to be matched to a different impedance by means of a mechanically varied combination of inductances and capacitances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One object of the present invention is thus, against the background of the prior art of this generic type that has just been mentioned, to provide an improved circuit for power splitting, in particular an improved variable circuit for splitting or joining radio-frequency powers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the object is achieved in accordance with the features specified in claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are specified in the dependent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The circuit arrangement according to the invention is not only novel but, in terms of its overall structure and with regard to the advantages which can be achieved by it, is highly surprising. This is because one preferred embodiment of the circuit arrangement according to the invention makes it possible to achieve a variable power split without the input impedance varying in the process. According to the invention, this is achieved by a combination of variable coupling capacitances and a variable spur line, in which case both elements can be varied in a preferred manner by means of a common control element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The power split is in this case preferably implemented such that a further line, which is capacitively coupled, branches off from a continuous RF line at a defined point. In this case, a transformation is carried out for the resistance matching at the input port or sum port, without this having&mdash;as mentioned&mdash;any consequential effect on, or causing any change to, the input impedance. Frequency compensation or frequency predistortion is carried out on the output branch. According to the invention, the power split can now be varied by moving, without any problems, an adjustment or movement element which is provided, to be precise without any reaction on the input impedance. Now, according to the invention, not only different type appliances but only one type, which is adjustable differently, are required for different power division ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The circuit arrangement according to the invention can thus be installed for the most different forms of power branches in an RF broadband network, for example in the case of signal transmission in a building, for the various power branches in the individual storeys, building complexes, etc. In this case, the desired power split can be set without any problems just by rotating an adjustment element such that it corresponds to the power branch to be provided. If, furthermore, it is remembered that a large number of distribution panels are normally required for the wiring in a building, in order to split the signals that are fed in (for example in the cellar) between a large number of lines and in order, for example, possibly once again to carry out a power split between different branch lines, possibly all having different proportions of the power, in the individual storeys of a building, then the advantages according to the invention become even clearer. This is because, according to the invention, only a single circuit device is required for, in particular, continuously variable power splitting, which can in each case be set without any problems for the particular requirements, thus now making it possible, without any problems, to compensate for different cable lengths, cable attenuations, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The power split according to the invention is preferably carried out using a compensating element which is arranged in a variable position. Varying the position varies the output of power into the branching line and, in the process according to the invention, at the same time compensates for the resistance change caused by the output variation. The compensating element, whose position can be varied mechanically, may be electrically conductive, but need not be. For example, it is just as possible to use a dielectric compensating element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the adjustment element may in this case be arranged in an axial extension for the branching line, with the main line, which runs between the input port and the further output port (that is to say between the sum port and the further individual port) being arranged transversely with respect to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The desired varied output can preferably be achieved by means of a mechanically adjustable probe, whose axial position can be varied, for example, by radial twisting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> However, by way of example, the compensating element may also be adjusted differently by means of some other type of adjustment mechanism. For this purpose, a further preferred exemplary embodiment provides for the control element to have the capability to be moved linearly on the circuit housing. The adjustment movement is in this case preferably carried out in the axial longitudinal direction of the circuit housing. The adjustment movement, that is say preferably the linear adjustment movement of the compensating element, can be produced and implemented via this adjustment movement, preferably internally in the adjustment element, with the adjustment movement of the compensating element being at right angles to the adjustment movement of the control element. The overall arrangement has the further advantage that, for example, an easily visible scale can be fitted, in which case it is possible to read the current power split setting exactly, as a function of the movement position of the adjustment element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Finally, the step-up ratio between the control element and the compensating element may also be produced non-linearly, if this is desired. Otherwise, a linear step-up ratio can be achieved at any time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The bandwidth of the output unit may be very wide, for example 45%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The circuit arrangement according to the invention may be designed to be coaxial. However, it may also be implemented by means of discrete components, or using board technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It should be noted, merely for the sake of completeness, that the circuit according to the invention may also have a number of variable output elements in order to form an n-tuple distribution panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The circuit according to the invention for splitting or for joining radio-frequency powers, having a main line or main path (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) which is connected between an input port (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and a first output port (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), and having a branch line (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) which branches off from the main line at a branching point (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) and leads to a second output port (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is thus preferably distinguished in that a compensating element (<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>) is provided which is, in particular, adjustable, or can be installed and removed differently, and which can be varied by varying the capacitance of at least one capacitor (C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), which is connected in the branch line (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), and/or by varying the electrical length of a spur line (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) which is coupled to the branch line (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), such that the variable magnitude of the power being tapped off at the same time also makes it possible to compensate for the resistance change caused by the change in the power split.</paragraph>

A corresponding coaxial socket can thus be arranged at both the input port <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and at the first output port <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, on the opposite end faces, whose inner conductors are connected to the inner conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;, and whose outer conductors are connected to the outer conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&Prime;, of the circuit arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The second output port <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided in the vicinity of the first output port <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the side <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> adjacent to the opposite end face, and may likewise once again be in the form of an RF connection with an appropriate RF socket, as is also shown in greater detail in the schematic cross-sectional view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from the schematic cross-sectional view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that the main line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> comprises the coaxial tube <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which has been mentioned, with the outer conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&Prime; forming the housing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the circuit arrangement, and, in the interior, the inner conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;, which is DC-isolated from it, being passed through it as a metallically conductive rod. To this end, the electrically conductive metallic rod which is used as the inner conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; is mounted and held at least in the region of the input port <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and of the first output port <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the end of the main line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in corresponding insulating supports <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which are preferably composed of plastic, and is thus DC-isolated from the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> At the level of the second output port <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the electrically continuous inner conductor or rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the main line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has a thickened section <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> with a transverse hole <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, within which, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, an insulator <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is incorporated, which is in the form of a sleeve and is preferably composed of plastic. As can be seen from the detail cross-sectional illustration (rotated through 90&deg;) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, this means that there is no interruption in the conductivity of the inner conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The inner conductor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime;, which is in the form of a rod, on the coaxial connecting line or of the coaxial connection for the second output port <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided such that it is axially aligned with the transverse hole <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and has, adjacent to the transverse hole <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in the inner conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the main line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, an end section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which is in the form of a sleeve or pot and which, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, is likewise once again provided on the inside with a hollow cylindrical insulator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, preferably composed of plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Axially opposite on the other side of the outer conductor or housing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, there is a control element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, illustrated with a spindle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, in order to push a compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> increasingly further in or back in the axial direction by twisting as shown by the illustrated arrow <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The control element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> with the spindle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are in this case not electrically conductively coupled, at least not to the outer conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&Prime;. The compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, which is metallic in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, is thus moved axially differently via the spindle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, with the compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in this case passing through the hollow cylindrical thickened section <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the inner conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the main line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and engaging to a different extent in the hollow cylindrical inner conductor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime;, which is DC-isolated from the inner conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the main line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The capacitor C<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) which has been mentioned is formed by the hollow cylinder or body <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (which is in the form of a sleeve) which is part of the inner conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the main line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and by the cylindrical compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> which passes through this body <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> that is in the form of a sleeve. Since the compensating element also engages to a different extent in the further body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which is in the form of a sleeve or socket, and is aligned with the body <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> that is in the form of a sleeve, the further capacitor C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) is formed between the compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and this body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that is in the form of a sleeve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Finally, the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>), which has likewise already been mentioned, is formed by the two bodies <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (which is electrically conductively connected to the inner conductor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the main line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), which are in the form of sleeves and are DC-isolated from one another, and to the body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (which is electrically connected to the inner conductor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime; of the branch line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), which is in the form of a sleeve and is axially at a distance from the former. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, the compensating element can be adjusted axially by twisting the adjustment element, thus varying the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and, in particular, C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Since the axial distance between the two bodies <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which are in the form of sleeves does not vary, the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>which is formed between these components is not variable in this embodiment. The electrically effective layer of the open spur line <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is also varied as appropriate in this case by turning the compensating element in and out differently as appropriate, with the electrical length of the spur line <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> becoming shorter the further the compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> engages in the corresponding bodies <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which are in the form of sleeves, of the spur line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Instead of the electrically conductive compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a non-conductive compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> may also be used, which furthermore offers the advantage that it is then always possible to dispense with the insulators which have been mentioned in the interior of the adjustment elements <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which are in the form of sleeves or pots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A power splitter, which is explained in a corresponding manner, has a broadband design and can be adjusted variably as required can be used without any problems in a broadband RF range from, for example, 800 MHz to 2200 MHz. The difference in the power split &Dgr;P between the output port <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may in this case amount to values from 5 dB to 20 dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The exemplary embodiment has been explained with reference to an open spur line <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. However, a closed spur line <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is also possible, at least in certain situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A more specific exemplary embodiment will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which differs from the previous exemplary embodiments primarily in that the control element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is not in the form of a control element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>&prime; which can rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A corresponding appliance according to the invention for power splitting is shown in the form of a side view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, with the housing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, which has a square cross section and extends in the axial longitudinal direction between the input port <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the input and output port <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> At the level of the second output port <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is aligned transversely with respect to it, the linearly adjustable control element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is shown, which is cuboid in shape and in this case engages around the housing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, which extends axially. This cuboid control element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>&Prime; can be moved along the illustrated arrow <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction of the housing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and is in this case shown in its one end position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> in its other extreme or end position, which is opposite the other end position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The cuboid control element housing <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>&Prime; in this case has on its one control element face <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> a recess which is, for example, rectangular, or a corresponding viewing area, with this recess or this viewing area <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> having an associated adjustment or reading device <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment in the form of a projecting tab <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>&prime;. Underneath the viewing area <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, that is to say the recess <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, a scale <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is fitted externally on that housing wall <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime; of the housing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which is located underneath. Depending on the axial adjustment movement of the control element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>&prime;, it is now possible to read exactly on the scale <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> how the power distribution is being implemented on the basis of the setting of the control element <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>&prime;, at the two recesses <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> show the control mechanism, showing the corresponding appliance, partially in section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from the section illustrations in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> that an insulator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, which is in the form of a sleeve, is accommodated in the sleeve or in the end section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which is in the form of a pot, along which insulator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> the compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> can be moved axially, transversely with respect to the axial direction of the housing <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&mdash;as discussed with reference to the previous exemplary embodiments. The axial adjustment movement of the compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is produced via a transmission element <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> which is in the form of a connecting stub in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, is axially firmly connected to the compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and can be moved together with this compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> with respect to the end section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which is in the form of a sleeve or pot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the illustration in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, a slotted guide <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> in the form of a guide groove <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>&prime; is incorporated internally on a front and rear side wall section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the control element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>&Prime;, which can be moved in the direction of the arrow <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, in which guide groove <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>&prime; a guide pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> engages, which projects transversely with respect to the guide groove <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>&prime; and is formed on or is attached to the transmission element <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> An adjustment movement of the cuboid control element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>&prime; in the axial direction <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, that is to say in the axial longitudinal direction of the housing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, necessarily results in an adjustment movement at right angles to this, namely in the adjustment direction <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. This is because the guide pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, which is held via the transmission element <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, cannot cope with an axial longitudinal movement direction corresponding to the illustrated arrow <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and is held by the corresponding adjustment movement of the control element <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> such that it follows the respective position of the guide groove <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>&prime;, as a result of which the transmission element <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, and hence also the compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, necessarily carries out the desired adjustment movement in the direction of the illustrated arrow <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. The transmission element <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is thus guided in a sleeve <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the slotted guide <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> or the guide groove <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>&prime; may be designed to be linear. This results in a linear step-up ratio. The step-up ratio depends on the groove gradient and may, for example, be in the order of magnitude of approximately 1:2. The slotted guide or the guide groove may, however, also be designed to be curved, as is shown in the exemplary embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, as a result of which a corresponding axial adjustment movement in the direction of the arrow <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is changed to an entry movement or backward movement, of a different extent, of the compensating element <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in the hollow or in the pot-shaped end section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Said scale <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> must then be designed to match the stepup ratio and the capacitor effect in order in this way to clearly read what the power split setting is. </paragraph>
