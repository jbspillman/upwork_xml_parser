<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a monitoring apparatus that can record visual images from n monitoring cameras over a long time by switching the images. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, visual images from n units of cameras are switched on a picture by picture basis (in other words, a field by field basis or a frame by frame basis, because a picture is composed of a field or a frame) and recorded on magnetic tape or the like as a recording medium by a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus over a long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> If any event or accident happens, the magnetic tape is played back to analyze the event or accident. For this analysis, &ldquo;picture-by-picture reproduction&rdquo; is carried out to reproduce important scenes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus feeds the recording medium by only one picture when a picture feed button is operated once. Accordingly, if visual images from one particular fixed camera is to be reproduced on a picture by picture basis, the picture feed button must be depressed n times in order to update an arbitrary visual image from the fixed camera because a visual image desired to be reproduced (analyzed) is recorded every n-th picture on the magnetic tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention solves this problem. It is an object of the present invention to provide a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus which enables a recording medium to be automatically fed by n pictures through one picture feed operation and which is internally provided with visual image storage means for enabling an arbitrary camera visual image to be reproduced even during a picture feed shift. </paragraph>
</section>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a timing chart for visual image signals according to Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> visual image am (m&equals;1, 2, 3, . . . ) corresponds to a visual image signal from the camera a, a visual image bm (m&equals;1, 2, 3, . . . ) corresponds to a visual image signal from the camera b, . . . a visual image nm (m&equals;1, 2, 3, . . . ) corresponds to a visual image signal from the camera n. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> After a switching operation by the visual image switching apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, an input to and an output from the visual image input means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have a visual image signal containing visual images a<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, b<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , n<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, b<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, . . . , as shown in a visual image P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A magnetic tape A has a recording format in which the visual image P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is recorded by the magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Reference character P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a visual image reproduced during picture-by-picture reproduction. In this case, if an instruction for picture feed is given while a still image of the visual image al is being output by the visual image output means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, then after the still image of the visual image al, the visual image output means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> outputs a still image of the visual image a<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and then a still image of the visual image a<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A specific description will be given of the configuration of the tape feed controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a picture feed amount setting means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and operation button <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> used to feed the magnetic tape by n pictures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The amount of picture feed with which the magnetic tape A performs picture-by-picture reproduction is set in the picture feed amount setting means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this case, visual images from the n units of cameras have been sequentially recorded on the magnetic tape through switching operations. Accordingly, if only visual images from one particular camera, that is the camera a, are to be reproduced by sequentially feeding the magnetic tape by n pictures in like manner as the visual image P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> reproduced during the picture-by-picture reproduction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the value of n pictures is set in the picture feed amount setting means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> If the still image to be reproduced is the visual image al, when the operation button <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is depressed in order to subject the magnetic tape A to picture-by-picture reproduction, the tape feed controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> controls the capstan motor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to feed the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by n pictures, set by the picture feed amount setting means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Thus, the next still image is a visual image a<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Each time the operation button <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is depressed, the visual image recording/reproducing means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provides the reproduced visual image P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the order of the visual image al, visual image a<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and visual image a<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The visual image output means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> outputs this visual image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> That is, when the magnetic tape having visual images from the n units of cameras recorded by switching the visual images on a picture by picture basis performs picture-by-picture reproduction, the magnetic tape is automatically fed by n pictures through one button operation. Consequently, only fixed camera visual images can always be reproduced by sequentially feeding the magnetic tape by specified pictures. </paragraph>

At the same time, camera numbers are transmitted from the camera number recognizing means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the visual image recording/reproducing means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in synchronism with the visual images P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The visual images P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the camera numbers are recorded on the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The magnetic tape B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows how these visual images and camera numbers are recorded on the magnetic tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Then, a desired-camera number is set in the playback camera number setting means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Here, it is assumed that the camera b is selected. Then, even if the current still image is a visual image al, when the operation button <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is depressed in order to subject the magnetic tape B to picture-by-picture reproduction, the picture feed controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> controls the capstan motor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to feed the magnetic tape B until information on the visual image b set in the playback camera number setting means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is transmitted from the camera number recognizing means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Thus, the next still image is a visual image b<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The visual image recording/reproducing means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provides the reproduced visual image P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Each time the operation button <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is depressed, the visual image output means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provides reproduced visual images f from the camera b in the order of, for example, the visual image al, visual image.b<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and visual image b<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> That is, when the magnetic tape having visual images from the n units of cameras recorded by switching the visual images on a picture by picture basis performs picture-by-picture reproduction, the magnetic tape is automatically fed by n pictures through one button operation. Consequently, only fixed camera visual images can always be reproduced by sequentially feeding the magnetic tape by specified pictures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In this case, the picture feed controller performs a picture feed operation until an arbitrary camera number is recognized. A maximum-picture feed amount setting means may be provided which stops a picture feed operation if the camera number cannot be recognized even after the magnetic tape has been fed by a specified amount. Then, even if a camera number that has not been recorded is mistakenly set in the playback camera number setting means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the picture feed operation can be automatically stopped instead of being continued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, one camera visual image (a visual image composed of one field or one frame) recorded on the magnetic tape is represented by one track. However, similar effects are produced by recording one camera visual image in a plurality of tracks as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> or by synthesizing two camera visual images together and recording the synthesized visual image in a plurality of tracks as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
