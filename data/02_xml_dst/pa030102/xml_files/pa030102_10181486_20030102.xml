<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a control apparatus and a control method of a fuel cell system, in which fuel gas and oxidant gas are supplied to a fuel cell to generate electric power, the generated power is supplied to a load circuit to drive a load, and the generated power is also stored in a power storage unit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a fuel cell system used as a power source of a vehicle, a fuel cell stack is often used, which is obtained in such a manner that a fuel cell structure having an oxidant electrode and a fuel electrode provided as a pair interposing a solid polymer electrolyte film therebetween is sandwiched by separators, and a plurality of the fuel cell structures are laminated on each other. Electric power generated from the fuel cell stack is charged to a battery and then used to drive a motor in the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> With respect to a fuel cell system, a control performed in such a manner that a charge level of a battery (SOC) is set high at the time of low speed driving to secure driving force of a motor whereby to secure electric power capable of being outputted from the battery, is disclosed in the gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-92610. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Also, with respect to a conventional fuel cell system, for example, a method is disclosed in the gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10(1998)-271706. In this method, detected is a state where a main load such as a motor installed in a vehicle is almost zero, and as a result of the detection, when a judgment for the detected state tells that a battery is to be charged, the battery is charged. According to this method, in the conventional fuel cell system, it has been possible to supply sufficient electric power at all time even when the electric power required by the load changes largely. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in a fuel cell system disclosed in the gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-92610, a control is performed in such a manner that a vehicle speed is detected and a target charge level is set in accordance with the detected vehicle speed, thus securing outputable power of a battery. Therefore, it requires a certain amount of time for actually charging the battery and securing the output, resulting in occurrence of a problem that the fuel cell system cannot meet immediate needs in some cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Also, in a fuel cell system disclosed in the gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10(1998)-271706, a control is performed in such a manner that a state, in which a battery should be charged is considered as a state in which a main load becomes almost zero, is detected, then a battery is judged to be charged. Therefore, when a relatively intermediate load continues, that is, when a period of time when the main load is almost zero is short, the battery cannot be sufficiently charged. Consequently, in this fuel cell system, there has been a problem that supplied electric power to a change in used power required by the load becomes deficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention was made with taking the above-described problems into consideration, and an object thereof is to provide a control method and a control apparatus for a fuel cell system capable of achieving sufficient power supply at any time to a load whose used power changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above-described problems, a first aspect of the present invention is a control apparatus for a fuel cell system, in which fuel gas and oxidant gas are supplied to a fuel cell to generate electric power, a load is driven by supplying the generated power to a load circuit, and the generated power from the fuel cell is stored in a power storage unit. The control apparatus comprises: a margin load power setting section for setting a margin load power amount, which is an increased amount of the electric power supplied from the power storage unit and the fuel cell to the load circuit when the load of the load circuit is increased at a predetermined rate; an outputable power computing section for computing outputable power of the power storage unit; an inputable power computing section for computing electric power capable of being inputted and stored in the power storage unit; and a control section for comparing the margin load power set by the margin load power setting section and the outputable power computed by the outputable power computing section to generate an amount judgment result, comparing the inputable power and an electric power difference between the margin load power and the outputable power when the outputable power is smaller than the margin load power as a result of the amount judgment to generate an amount judgment result, generating electric power to set the inputable power to be charged power of the power storage unit when an electric power difference between the margin load power and the outputable power is larger than the inputable power as a result of the amount judgment, and controlling a flow rate or pressure of gas supplied to the fuel cell to make it possible to always generate electric power equivalent to a deficient amount of the electric power obtained by subtracting the inputable power and the outputable power from the margin load power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a second aspect of the present invention is a control method for a fuel cell system, in which fuel gas and oxidant gas are supplied to a fuel cell to generate electric power, a load is driven by supplying the generated power to a load circuit, and the generated power from the fuel cell is stored in a power storage unit. The control method comprises the steps of: setting in advance a margin load power amount, which is an increased amount of an electric power amount supplied from the power storage unit and the fuel cell to the load when the load of the load circuit is increased at a predetermined rate; computing electric power capable of being inputted and stored in the power storage unit, and computing outputable power of the power storage unit; generating an amount judgment result by comparing the inputable power and the electric power difference between the margin load power and the outputable power; and generating the electric power such that the inputable power becomes the charged power to the power storage unit, and controlling the flow rate or the pressure of the gas supplied to the fuel cell such that a deficient amount of the electric power obtained by subtracting the inputable power and the outputable power from the margin load power is always generated when the electric power difference between the margin load power and the outputable power is larger than the inputable power as a result of the amount judgment.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The required load computing section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> computes required load power required to drive the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, based on the accelerator operating amount information and the vehicle speed information. Then, the required load computing section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> outputs computed required load power information S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the target power generation amount computing section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The inputable/outputable power computing section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> computes inputable power information showing a value of the electric power capable of being stored in the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and outputable power information showing a value of the electric power capable of being outputted from the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, based on the battery temperature and the charging level information. Then, the inputable/outputable power computing section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> outputs inputable power information S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and outputable power information S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> computes a target charge amount serving as a target of electric power which is generated by the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and which is also stored in the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> based on margin load power information S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the inputable power information S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the outputable power information S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Then, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> determines the target charge amount within a range of the inputable power so as to allow the charged power to approach the margin load power and then outputs target charged power information S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the target power generation amount computing section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> computes based on the margin load power information S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the outputable power information S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the inputable power information S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Then, the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> obtains target FC margin power information S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> showing the target FC margin power capable of being taken out immediately and supplied to the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and outputs the same to the gas supply amount control section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The target power generation amount computing section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> computes based on auxiliary device consumption power information S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the target generated power information S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the required load power information S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, the target power generation amount computing section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> obtains target generated power information S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> showing a value of the electric power serving as a target of the electric power generated by the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputs the same to the gas supply amount control section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The gas supply amount control section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> controls the pressure control valve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the pressure control valve <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> based on the target generated power information S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the target FC margin power information S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to control the pressure and the flow rate of the fuel gas and the oxidant gas supplied to the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thus controlling the generated power of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows changes in electric power supplied from the fuel cell stack and the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the load so as to correspond to the changes in the electric power required by the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. As apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in the case where the curve A represents the electric power necessary for driving the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, if the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can only generate the electric power represented by the curve B, the power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is compensated by the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> supplying the electric power to the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the electric power represented by the curve C is for compensating the electric power represented by the shaded area in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Here, assuming the electric power represented by the curve C required at the time of the maximum acceleration of the vehicle, the value of the margin load power is set in advance and is stored in the margin load power memory section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a relation between output power of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and pressure values as well as flow rates of fuel gas and oxidant gas. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, solid lines represent the minimum necessary flow rate and the minimum necessary pressure for taking out the electric power from the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Here, the gas supply amount control section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> controls each component such that the control target flow rate and pressure are set as the flow rate value and the pressure value (shown by &Circlesolid; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) increased by the target FC margin power, and then, the electric power actually taken out from the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is set as the target power generation amount (shown by &compfn; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Consequently, a sum of the electric power of the target power generation amount and the target FC margin power can be taken out from the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is operated at the maximum load and the requirement for the required load power occurs, the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> controls such that the amount of the electric power equivalent to the target FC margin power is immediately taken out from the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is supplied to the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the target FC margin power is zero, the gas supply amount control section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> controls the motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to reduce a drive amount of the compressor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so as to obtain the minimum necessary flow rate and the minimum necessary pressure, and then, the electric power actually taken out from the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is set as the target power generation amount. In other words, when obtaining the output power represented by &compfn; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the gas supply amount control section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> sets the points, at which the dotted line extending from &compfn; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> crosses with the lines representing each of properties, as the control target flow rate and the control target pressure. </paragraph>

The outputable power and the inputable power change also with temperatures, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows each of the properties at a room temperature and at a low temperature. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, process steps of a power control process by the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the above-described constitution are shown. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, when driving the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> first detects a temperature of the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by the outputable power computing section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> based on a sensor signal from the battery sensor (not shown) in step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then the process proceeds to the next step ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> calculates the charge level based on a current value and a voltage value of the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and outputs the result to the inputable/outputable power computing section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Next, in step ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the inputable/outputable power computing section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> calculates the inputable power information S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the outputable power information S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> according to the battery temperature and the charge level obtained in steps ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Here, the inputable/outputable power computing section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> obtains the inputable power and the outputable power based on the properties of the inputable power and the outputable power with respect to the charge level as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the battery temperature and the charge level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reads out the margin load power information stored in the margin load power memory section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in step ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the next step ST<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the accelerator operating amount information and the vehicle speed information are inputted to the required load computing section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In the next step ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the required load computing section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> computes the required load power required by the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> based on the accelerator operating amount information and the vehicle speed information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the next step ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the auxiliary device consumption power computing section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> computes the auxiliary device consumption power information S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the next step ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> compares the amount of the margin load power stored in the margin load power memory section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the amount of the outputable power obtained in step ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to determine whether or not the margin load power is smaller than the outputable power. When the margin load power is smaller than the outputable power, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> described later when the margin load power is not smaller than the outputable power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the margin load power is smaller than the outputable power, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> recognizes that the outputable power can cover the margin load power as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A and that the margin load power can be secured without additional charging. Then, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> outputs the target charged power information S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a zero target charge amount to the target power generation amount computing section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and then proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the target power generation amount computing section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> takes the target power generation amount to be equal to the required load power obtained in step ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and outputs the target generated power information S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the gas supply amount control section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Then, the target FC margin power is set 0 in step ST<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Here, the target power generation computing section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> includes also the auxiliary device consumption power, obtained in step ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in the target power generation amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the margin load power is determined not smaller than the outputable power in step ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> computes an electric power difference of the outputable power with respect to the margin load power in step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this case, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> recognizes the electric power difference by subtracting outputable power from the margin load power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in step ST<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the electric power difference computed in step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is smaller than the inputable power. When it is determined that the power difference is smaller than the inputable power, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, but when determined that the electric power difference is not smaller than the inputable power, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> recognizes that the electric power difference can be covered by charging the electric power equivalent to the inputable power as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, and sets the electric power difference computed in step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as the target charge amount as it is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the next step ST<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the target power generation amount computing section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> receives the required load power obtained in step ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from the required load computing section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, receives the target charge amount obtained in step ST<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Then, the electric power amount obtained by adding the required load power and the target charge amount is set as the target power generation amount, and the target FC margin power is set 0 in step ST<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> If it is determined that the electric power difference is not smaller than the inputable power in step ST<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the target charge amount computing unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> recognizes in step ST<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that the electric power difference cannot be covered by the inputable power as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C and sets the inputable power as the target charge amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the next step ST <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the target power generation amount computing section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> adds the required load power from the required load computing section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the target charge amount to obtain the target power generation amount. Here, the target power generation amount computing section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> includes the auxiliary device consumption power, obtained in the above-described step ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in the target power generation amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the next step ST<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> obtains the electric power difference by subtracting the outputable power from the margin load power, and then, the target FC margin power (deficient amount of the electric power) is obtained by subtracting the inputable power from the obtained power difference. Thereafter, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the next step ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the gas supply amount control section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> outputs the control signal for controlling each component based on the target generated power information S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and then sets the flow rate and the pressure of the fuel gas and the oxidant gas so as to obtain the target generation amount and the target FC margin power as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Effect of the Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> According to the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> performing the process as described above, in the case where the outputable power is smaller than the margin load power as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, and also when the inputable power is larger than the electric power difference, the target power generation amount is set so as to compensate the electric power difference with the target charge amount. By doing so, the margin load power can be taken out at any time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> for example, the generated power output of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> exceeds the required load during the period T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> before the load of the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is changed, and the electric power is charged to the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. The sum total of the target charged power at this time and the outputable power becomes the margin load power. Note that the difference between the fuel cell output (Net) and the fuel cell output (Gross) is the electric power consumed by the auxiliary devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Here, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, the electric power equivalent to the target charge amount can be supplied since the target charge amount is set so as to secure the margin load power at all times even in the case where the required load is largely changed during the next period T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the change in the electric power output from the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> delays with respect to the changing speed of the required load, and furthermore, even in the case where the required load exceeds the sum total value of the electric power output from the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the outputable power of the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Therefore, according to the fuel cell system, even when the load of the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is drastically changed, it becomes possible to supply the margin load power to the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and to make the electric power supply to follow the change in the required load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Also, in this fuel cell system, the electric power supplied from the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be kept within the outputable power. Therefore, according to the fuel cell system, it becomes possible to inhibit the progression of deterioration of the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Moreover, during the period T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> after the load change, the fuel cell system continues to charge the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, thus making it possible to set the charge level high enough to cover the margin load power with the outputable power. Therefore, according to the fuel cell system, when the required load of the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is not changed, electric charge is performed to the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, thus making it possible to supply the margin load power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> performing the process as described above, in the case where the outputable power is smaller than the margin load power as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, even when the inputable power is smaller than the electric power difference therebetween, the margin load power can be secured by setting the target FC margin power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, during the period T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> before the load of the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> changes, the fuel cell output (Net) exceeds the required load, and the electric power is charged to the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the electric power smaller than the inputable power as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Here, it is assumed that, since the inputable power of the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is small during the period T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the margin load power cannot be covered only by the sum total of the charged electric power and the outputable power in the period T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Contrary to this, in the fuel cell system, it is assumed that the target FC margin power is set in step ST<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the surplus electric power can always be outputted. Then, when the required load of the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> becomes large, the electric power already taken out and the target FC margin power are taken out from the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, the charged power of the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is supplied to the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the fuel cell system, it is possible to immediately take out the target FC margin power and to shorten the period of time in which the output of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is insufficient with respect to the load, and it is also possible to reduce the insufficient amount of the output of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, the electric power can be supplied in response to the change in the required load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the fuel cell system, it is possible to cope with the load change rapidly by supplying the target FC margin power to the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> even when the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at a low temperature cannot output much electric power in comparison to that at the room temperature as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and even when electric power is not thus sufficiently supplied with respect to the load change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the fuel cell system, the electric power inputted to the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be kept within the outputable power, and the electric power outputted from the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be kept within the outputable power. Therefore, it is possible to inhibit the progression of deterioration of the power storage unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made for a notification process for a user at the time of supplying the target FC margin power to the load unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, first in step ST<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the target FC margin power is computed by the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> similarly to the above-described step ST<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for example, and the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> controls the pressure control valve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the pressure control valve <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and then judges whether or not the target FC margin power computed in step ST<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be obtained. When it is judged possible to obtain the target FC margin power, the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. When it is judged impossible to obtain the target FC margin power, the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> carries out a control so as to turn off a margin deficiency lamp, which notifies the vehicle driver that it is impossible to supply the target FC margin power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> carries out a control so as to turn on the margin deficiency lamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> By doing so, in the fuel cell system, it becomes possible to notify the vehicle driver that the acceleration performance is lowered. In addition, by notifying that there remains little power left for a demanding case such as rapid acceleration, it becomes possible to promote driving operations according to situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Here, means for notifying infeasibility of the target FC margin power to the vehicle driver is not limited to a lamp, and a display machinery and an audio machinery (not shown) may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Judgment Process Based on Temperature of Fuel Cell Stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made for an example with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, in which the judgment in step ST<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is carried out based on a temperature of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, in step ST<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> computes the target FC margin power similarly to the above-described process and starts the following process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the next step ST<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a temperature of a coolant supplied to the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is detected by a temperature sensor (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In the next step ST<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the maximum possible power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is computed based on the coolant temperature detected in step ST<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Here, the maximum possible power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is obtained based on the coolant temperature with reference to the relation between the coolant temperature (fuel cell temperature) from the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the maximum possible power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the next step ST<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a sum total amount of the target generated power and the target FC margin power is compared to the maximum possible power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When the sum total amount of the target generated power and the target FC margin power is smaller than the maximum possible power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. When the sum total amount of the target generated power and the target FC margin power is not smaller than the maximum possible power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the flow rate and the pressure of the fuel gas and the oxidant gas for generating the electric power are computed, where the electric power is the sum total of the target generated power and the target FC margin power at the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, it is judged that the target FC margin power is feasible, and then the process proceeds to step ST <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Then, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when it is judged that the sum total amount of the target generated power and the target FC margin power is larger than the maximum possible power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in step ST<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. In step ST<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, the gas supply amount control section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> computes the flow rate and the pressure of the fuel gas and the oxidant gas based on the maximum possible power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> computed in step ST<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Then, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, it is judged that the target FC margin power is infeasible. Then, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> According to the fuel cell system performing such process as described above, the maximum possible power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which changes with the temperature changes of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is obtained to judge whether or not the target FC margin power can be supplied in order to cover the margin load power. Therefore, it becomes possible to accurately determine that there remains little power left for an excessive load change based on the temperature state of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Judgment Process Based on Stoichiometric Ratio </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made for an example where the judgment of step ST<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is carried out based on the stoichiometric ratio of the fuel gas or the oxidant gas shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, in step ST<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the target FC margin power is computed by the target FC margin power computing section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> similarly to the above-described process. Then the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to start the following process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a limit stoichiometric ratio is computed based on the target power generation amount and the target FC margin power. Then the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Here, the stoichiometric ratio is a value obtained by dividing the gas supply amount to the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the gas supply amount consumed by fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the stoichiometric ratio changes depending on the generated power of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In this case, the limit stoichiometric ratio changes also depending on pure-water collection efficiency and humidification properties of the fuel cell system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a target FC margin power amount implementing stoichiometric ratio is computed by dividing the flow rates of the fuel gas and the oxidant gas necessary for implementing the power generation of the sum total of the target generated power and the target FC margin power by the flow rates of the fuel gas and the oxidant gas consumed when the power is generated. Then, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the limit stoichiometric ratio computed in step ST<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the target FC margin power amount implementing stoichiometric ratio computed in step ST<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are compared to each other. When it is judged that the target FC margin power amount implementing stoichiometric ratio is larger than the limit stoichiometric ratio, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. When it is judged that the target FC margin power amount implementing stoichiometric ratio is not larger than the limit stoichiometric ratio, the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, a target stoichiometric ratio is set as the target FC margin power amount implementing stoichiometric ratio, and then the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, it is judged that the target FC margin power is feasible, and then the process proceeds to step ST <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, a target stoichiometric ratio is set as the limit stoichiometric ratio shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, and then the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In step ST<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, it is judged that the target FC margin power is infeasible, and then the process proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> According to the fuel cell system performing such process as described above, the maximum possible power generation amount of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which changes depending on the consumption change of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is obtained, and it is then judged whether or not the target FC margin power for covering the margin load power can be supplied. Therefore, it becomes possible to accurately determine that there remains little power left for an excessive load change based on the consumption state of the fuel cell stack <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> According to the control apparatus of the fuel cell system of the present invention, when the outputable power is smaller than the margin load power, the power generation amount of the fuel cell is controlled such that the charged power becomes larger than the electric power difference between the margin load power and the outputable power. Therefore, even if the load of the load circuit is increased, the electric power is supplied from the power storage unit, and the electric power equivalent to the margin load power can be supplied. Thus, it is possible to realize sufficient power supply to the load whose used power changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the electric power difference between the margin load power and the outputable power is larger than the inputable power as a result of the amount judgment, the electric power is generated such that the inputable power becomes the charged power of the power storage unit, and the flow rate or the pressure of the gas supplied to the fuel cell is controlled such that the deficient amount of the electric power obtained by subtracting the inputable power and the outputable power from the margin load power is always generated. Therefore, even if the power storage unit cannot sufficiently supply the electric power with respect to the load change due to a low temperature and the like, it becomes possible to immediately supply the electric power to the load circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the control apparatus of the fuel cell system of the present invention, it is judged that the fuel cell cannot generate the electric power equivalent to the deficient power amount with respect to the required margin power based on at least one of the temperature of the fuel cell, the stoichiometric ratio, the flow rate, and the pressure of the oxidant gas, and the stoichiometric ratio, the flow rate, and the pressure of the fuel gas. Therefore, it becomes possible to notify that there remains little power left for the load change, depending on the state of the fuel cell. </paragraph>

Therefore, it becomes possible to inhibit the progression of deterioration of the power storage unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> According to the control method of the fuel cell system of the present invention, when the outputable power is smaller than the margin load power as a result of the amount judgment, the power generation amount of the fuel cell is controlled such that the charged power becomes larger than the electric power difference between the margin load power and the outputable power. Therefore, even if the load of the load circuit is increased, the electric power is supplied from the power storage unit, and the electric power equivalent to the margin load power can be supplied. Thus, it is possible to realize sufficient power supply to the load whose used power changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the electric power difference between the margin load power and the outputable power is larger than the inputable power as a result of the amount judgment, the electric power is generated such that the inputable power becomes the charged power of the power storage unit, and the flow rate or the pressure of the gas supplied to the fuel cell is controlled such that the deficient amount of the electric power obtained by subtracting the inputable power and the outputable power from the margin load power is always generated. Therefore, even if the power storage unit cannot sufficiently supply the electric power with respect to the load change due to a low temperature and the like, it becomes possible to immediately supply the electric power to the load circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the control method of the fuel cell system of the present invention, it is judged that the fuel cell cannot generate the electric power equivalent to the deficient power amount for the required margin power based on at least one of the temperature of the fuel cell, the stoichiometric ratio, the flow rate, and the pressure of the oxidant gas, and the stoichiometric ratio, the flow rate, and the pressure of the fuel gas. Therefore, it becomes possible to notify that there remains little power left for the load change in accordance with the state of the fuel cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the control method of the fuel cell system of the present invention, when the fuel cell cannot generate the electric power equivalent to the deficient power amount, the user is notified that the required margin power cannot be secured. Therefore, it becomes possible to accurately notify the user that there remains little power left for the load change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Still furthermore, in the control method of the fuel cell system of the present invention, the control means sets the electric power supplied from the power storage unit to the load circuit to be equal to the outputable power or smaller, and also sets the electric power inputted from the fuel cell to the power storage unit to be equal to inputable power of the power storage unit or smaller.
