<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns a method and a device for passively aligning at least one optic fibre and at least one component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The component may be, as will be more clearly seen hereafter, an auxiliary alignment support for optic fibres or an opto-electronic component and, in this latter case, may be a photo-detector or a photo-emitter (for example, a diode or laser type). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In particular, the invention makes it possible to assemble a standard optic fibre tape and an array of emitting or receiving optical circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention also concerns the connection of a matrix of optic fibres to a VCSEL matrix, in other words, vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, or a matrix of photo-detectors of this type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the invention relates to opto-electronic components that one wishes to assemble to high capacity optical links (for example, optic cables fitted with connectors) as well as the assembly of &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; optic fibres and juxtaposed opto-electronic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The invention also makes it possible to form direct optical connections between light emitters and other light emitters intended for the optical pumping of the former emitters. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">STATE OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The coupling of an optic fibre and a laser beam emitter requires a precise alignment of this component and the fibre, in general an alignment to an accuracy of around 10 &mgr;m, the required precision being even greater in the case of monomode optic fibres. For the coupling of an optic fibre and a detection component (for example a VCSEL used as a photo-detector) the same accuracy is needed as for the coupling between the fibre and the emitter component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> If one considers the example of the coupling of an optic fibre and a laser emitter, a widely used alignment technique is the active alignment of the fibre and this laser emitter, wherein a voltage is applied to this emitter in order to emit a laser beam. When the alignment is obtained, the fibre is fixed to the laser emitter by welding or bonding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This active alignment technique leads to high costs for the assembly obtained thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For this reason, a passive alignment technique has been sought. In this case, the relative positioning then the fixing of the fibre and the emitting or receiving element are carried out without voltage being applied (for the element) nor luminous flux. The fibre and the element are mechanically wedged against each other and then fixed in a precise manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For example, a passive assembly technique for an optical fibre and a laser rod, whose emission is lateral, has been described. This assembly uses a support comprising a V groove, which is provided for the positioning of the optic fibre. This optic fibre is stuck in this V groove and the laser rod is hybrided with precision onto the support, opposite the fibre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This technique enables an accuracy of around 1 &mgr;m to 5 &mgr;m to be obtained. It enables an optic fibre and a lateral emission laser to be assembled but it does not enable the assembly of a fibre and a VCSEL type laser, which emits light via one face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, this technique has been modified in order to allow this type of assembly. In this case, optical or mechanical means are used to place the VCSEL at 90&deg; to the optic fibre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, this modified passive alignment technique requires the use of complex means, in particular auxiliary alignment means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In fact, if one wants to assemble an array of VCSEL (emitters or detectors) to optic fibres, the prior art shows that it is necessary to use an auxiliary alignment means and a support for the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;direct&rdquo; assembly of a VCSEL emitting via the rear face and an optic fibre is however described in the following documents: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (1) A. Keating et al., 6 Gbit/s optically pumped 1.55 &mgr;m VCSEL operating up to 105 &deg; C., Revue Photonics, vol. 12, n&deg; 2, 2000, pp. 116-118. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (2) Y. Kobayashi et al., Improvement of coupling efficiency for passive alignment of stacked multifiber tapes to a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser array, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., vol. 36, Part I, n&deg; 3B, 1997, pp. 1872-1875. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> This known assembly is obtained by forming a guiding hole in the substrate of the VCSEL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the invention, as in the prior art, one seeks to resolve the problem of the direct and precise coupling between at least one optic fibre and at least one opto-electronic component (emitter or detector), such as, for example, a &ldquo;planar&rdquo; type, this coupling being passive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In order to be clearer, let us consider the specific problem posed by the direct and precise assembly of a VCSEL and an optic fibre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Document (1) describes how optic fibres and opto-electronic devices (VCSEL) may be passively aligned by boring guiding holes in the substrate that bears the devices and by sliding the optic fibres into these holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This known technique has however the disadvantage of requiring the formation of guiding holes directly in the substrate where the devices are built up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> However, it involves a substrate made out of GaAs and therefore fragile, which risks breaking during the manufacture of the devices if it is drilled beforehand, or which risks breaking during the final manufacturing operations of the assembly if this substrate is bored after the manufacture of the devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Moreover, this substrate in GaAs, rendered fragile by the holes, may break during the introduction of the optic fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In addition, the boring of precise dimensions in a material such as GaAs is a little known technique and therefore difficult to implement. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An aim of the present invention is to resolve the aforementioned disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The invention proposes forming at least one housing, comprising an alignment guide, directly on a component, in such a way that one is able to align an optic fibre and the component without a support or an auxiliary alignment wedge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In a specific embodiment of the invention, where one wishes to connect optic fibres to one or several opto-electronic chips, the invention proposes forming alignment guides in the substrate of each chip, after hybriding this chip (or chips) onto the control circuit of this (these) chip(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For the formation of the alignment guides and the positioning of the fibres, the chip&mdash;control circuit assembly is more resistant than the chips on their own. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> More precisely, an aim of the present invention is a method for passively aligning at least one component and at least one optic fibre, wherein the component comprises a substrate that has first and second faces opposite each other, this method being characterised in that: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> at least two slots are formed in the substrate, starting from the first face of this substrate, wherein these two slots form a cross and define, at their intersection, a housing that is provided to receive one end of the optic fibre, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> this end is placed in the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to a first embodiment of the method according to the invention, the component is an opto-electronic component comprising at least one active zone formed on the side of the second face of the substrate, where this active zone is intended to emit or capture light and must be optically coupled to the optic fibre, and the slots are formed in such a way that the housing is positioned opposite the active zone of the opto-electronic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> This opto-electronic component comprises, for example, at least one vertical cavity surface emitting laser, formed by the active zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to a second specific embodiment, the component is an auxiliary alignment support for optic fibre(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to a specific embodiment of the invention, this auxiliary alignment support is coupled to an opto-electronic component comprising at least one active zone, wherein the housing of the auxiliary alignment support is formed in such a way as to be positioned opposite this active zone when the auxiliary alignment support is coupled to the opto-electronic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this case, the end of the optic fibre may be placed in the housing before, or after, the coupling of the auxiliary alignment support to the opto-electronic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In an example of the invention, several copies of the component (in particular when it involves an auxiliary alignment support) are formed, on a same substrate, then slots for each of these copies are formed and these copies are then separated from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> According to a specific embodiment of the method according to the invention, in the case where the component is an opto-electronic component, several copies of this opto-electronic component are formed on a same substrate, then slots for each of these copies are formed, then these copies are separated from each other, they are hybrided, on the side of their second faces, to an electronic control circuit and the respective optic fibre ends are placed in the housings formed on the copies, wherein these housings are provided to receive these ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> However, according to a preferred embodiment, several copies of the opto-electronic component are formed on a same substrate, these copies are separated from each other, they are hybrided, on the side of their second faces, to an electronic control circuit and then slots are formed for all of the copies thus hybrided and the respective optic fibre ends are placed in the housings formed on the copies, wherein these housings are provided to receive these ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the invention, the substrate may be transparent to the light intended to be captured or emitted by the optic fibre or, on the contrary, may be opaque to this light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In this latter case, a hole, provided to open out the housing into the second face of the substrate, is in addition formed (before or after the slots). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> This hole may be formed using a laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the invention, the slots are, for their part, preferably formed using a cutting machine comprising a circular saw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Another aim of the present invention is a device for passively aligning at least one component and at least one optic fibre, the component comprising a substrate that has first and second opposite faces, wherein this device is characterised in that it comprises at least two slots formed in the substrate leading from the first face of the substrate, wherein these two slots form a cross and define, by their intersection, a housing that is provided to receive one end of the optic fibre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> According to a specific embodiment of the device according to the invention, the component is an opto-electronic component that is hybrided, on the side of the second face of the substrate, to an electronic control circuit.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILLED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The device according to the invention, which is schematically represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, comprises an opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This opto-electronic component comprises a substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as well as one or several active zones, such as the active zones <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which are formed in the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, from one face of this substrate, and are each intended to emit or detect light. The substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is transparent to this light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It should be pointed out that the active zones <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> emit light towards the face opposite to the one from which these active zones <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> have been formed, or detect light coming from this opposite face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> This latter face is called the &ldquo;rear face&rdquo; or the &ldquo;upper face&rdquo;, whereas the face from which are formed the active zones <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is called the &ldquo;forward face&rdquo; or the &ldquo;lower face&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is assembled, through its lower face, on a control circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, using solder balls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, then coated with resin (reference <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Such an assembly may be obtained, in several copies, by collectively hybriding then coating, using the resin, the opto-electronic components of the type of component <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, on a whole sheet of silicon comprising control circuits for all of these components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In this respect, the reader should refer to the following document: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> (3) U.S. Pat. No. 5,574,285 A (F. Marion, A. Guiga, M. Boitel and G. Gaude), &ldquo;Electromagnetic radiation detector and its production process&rdquo;, corresponding to French patent application n&deg; 94 00115 of the Jan. 7, 1994. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, one wishes to align the optic fibres or, more precisely, the cores of these fibres with the active zones <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that constitute, for example, VCSEL type planar light emitters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, housings for the fibres are formed on the upper face of the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (or each opto-electronic component if several components have been hybrided to the control circuit). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> To obtain these housings, slots or grooves are formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> To do this, one only has to use a simple cutting machine comprising a saw, the circular blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of which can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> More precisely, using this machine, crossed slots are formed in the substrate, from the upper face of this substrate, as may be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the example shown, a fist slot <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed, which passes above three active zones, and three other slots <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that pass respectively above these three active zones, are perpendicular to this slot <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and thus form three crosses with this slot <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Through their three intersections, the slots <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> define three housings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that stretch out along the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, perpendicular to the upper face of this substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and are respectively positioned opposite the active zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Each housing substantially forms a prism with a square base (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>). The axis X (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>) of this housing is perpendicular to the upper face of the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, contains the intersection of the diagonals of this square and meets the corresponding active zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> It should be pointed out that, when all of the opto-electronic components are hybrided onto the silicon sheet mentioned above, these components are positioned to an accuracy greater than 1 &mgr;m, as known to the prior art. All that needs to be done then is to form precise slots, aligned on the alignment marks formed beforehand on the surface of the control circuit, so that these slots are also aligned in relation to the active zones of the opto-electronic components hybrided onto this surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Each housing is intended to receive the end of an optic fibre in order to optically couple this fibre to the active zone corresponding to this housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the substrate of each opto-electronic component, slots are formed in a precise manner, with a pre-determined width L (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>), in such a way that the distance between two opposite corners, at each intersection of two slots, is very slightly greater than the diameter D of the optic fibre <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that one wishes to insert in the housing formed by this intersection, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, where the reference <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> represents the core of the fibre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> One therefore chooses a width L very slightly greater than D/{square root}2 with, preferably, D&minus;L{square root}2&lE;2 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference> shows optic fibres <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> whose ends are respectively introduced (or are being introduced) into the housings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, in order to be optically coupled to the active zones corresponding to these housings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The axis X of each housing then coincides substantially with the axis of the core <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the end of the corresponding fibre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A layer of adhesive <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, positioned at the periphery of each fibre, enables the end of this fibre to be maintained in the corresponding housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> We will now give, in a purely indicative and in nowise limitative manner, an example corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In this example, a 200 mm diameter silicon sheet is used to give control circuits of 5 mm&times;5 mm, where each of these circuits are intended to control a detection circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Around one thousand AsGa detection circuits are hybrided onto this sheet, which are then coated with resin according to the technique called &ldquo;underfill&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Each detection circuit comprises ten VCSEL separated from each other by 250 &mgr;m and constitutes, after hybriding, an opto-electronic circuit of 1 mm&times;3 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The surface of gallium arsenide, which overruns the resin to a depth of around 200 &mgr;m, is notched with a saw whose blade has a width L of 90 &mgr;m and in such a manner that the intersections of the slots formed (which are horizontal and vertical from the top view) are opposite the VCSEL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The alignment is made, as we have seen, on the marks formed on the silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The distance D between two opposite corners of each intersection is equal to 90{square root}2, in other words 127 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Each control circuit fitted with its hybrided opto-electronic circuit is then cut out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Then, the end of an optic fibre is inserted and stuck in each housing formed on this opto-electronic circuit, by the intersection of two slots, with an alignment precision better than 2 &mgr;m in relation to the underlying VCSEL. The diameter of the optic fibre is equal to 125 &mgr;m&plusmn;1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D, it should be pointed out that the housings formed have the same function as the guiding holes described in document (2): they are also used to guide the ends of the optic fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> However, these housings or alignment guides (without lateral walls) are very different to these holes and are also obtained in a very different manner, these holes generally resulting from etching of a substrate in gallium arsenide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> One can, obviously, form the housings of the opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> before hybriding this component onto the control circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and one again obtains a precise alignment in relation to the active zones <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> However, one then risks ending up with the disadvantages described above regarding the fragility of substrates in gallium arsenide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D schematically illustrate an embodiment of the invention, which is shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the case of component <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D, the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, on the lower face of which one has built up an epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which active zones <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> have been formed, is not transparent to the light intended to be emitted or detected by these active zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> One then forms a hole <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, opposite each active zone <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in such a way as to remove the residual substrate and thus prolong the housing corresponding to this active zone up to the lower face of the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, in other words up to the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The size of this hole is greater than the diameter of the core of the corresponding optic fibre but less than the size of the corresponding housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be formed before the slots. In this case, each hole is formed from the upper surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> up to the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the slots are formed first, enabling the housings to be obtained then, at the bottom of each housing, a hole <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed, up to the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> These holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be formed collectively, for example by engraving of the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, in a standard manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, it should be noted that the holes do not have to be formed with precision as regards their diameter because the alignment of each optic fibre on the four corners of the corresponding housing is always allowed by the slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, a</cross-reference> substrate forming an intermediate alignment support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, fitted with optic fibres, for example the three fibres <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, is intended to be aligned with an opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> hybrided onto a control circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, for example in silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> This opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> comprises active zones <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> forming, for example, VCSEL. It is hybrided to the control circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by micro solder balls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A resin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> surrounds the opto-electronic component as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and thus stretches out into the space between the lower face of the opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the control circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, around the micro solder balls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Moreover, this resin stretches beyond the upper surface of the opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and thus defines, with this upper face, a space intended to receive the intermediate alignment support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As regards such a structure (formed by the control circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the resin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>), one should refer to document (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In the example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D, the present invention is applied to the manufacture of the intermediate alignment support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> This intermediate alignment support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, before the insertion of the ends of the optic fibres into it, may be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> This support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is treated in the same way as the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, in order to form (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</cross-reference>) the slots <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and thus define the housings, or alignment guides, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for the ends of the fibres, prolonged by the holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (with a diameter less than the size of the housings but greater that the diameter of the cores of the fibres), these holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> opening into the upper face of the support so that the light can go from an active zone to the corresponding fibre core and/or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Preferably, one forms the holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from one face to the other face of this support, for example using a laser with sufficient power, with a precision that is not very restrictive, and one then forms the slots in a precise manner, on the alignment support, in order to obtain the housings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Then, the ends of the support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are cut in a precise and complete manner, so as to insert it in the space demarcated by the resin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> It should be pointed out that a large number of copies of the support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are generally formed, from a single sheet <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, for example in silicon (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</cross-reference>). One may then collectively form the holes and the slots on this sheet and then cut all of the copies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The method schematically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C requires great precision for the formation of the slots and for the cutting of the edges of the support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, in relation to the housings intended to receive the ends of the fibres, so that the core of each fibre end can be aligned in a precise manner with the corresponding active zone <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The operations of forming the slots and cutting the edges of the support are carried out in series on the same machine and thus easily meet this requirement for precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> When the intermediate alignment support is formed and thus comprises the housings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the ends of the optic fibres may be inserted into the housings and the optic fibres immobilised using an adhesive <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The intermediate alignment support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, fitted with optic fibres, may then be inserted into the space mentioned above and this support immobilised in relation to the opto-electronic component <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by means of an adhesive <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (stretching from the periphery of the support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the resin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the example shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, one begins by positioning the intermediate support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in this space, then it is immobilised in relation to the opto-electronic component by means of the adhesive <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, then the ends of the optic fibres are inserted into the corresponding housings and the fibres are immobilised by means of the adhesive <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> By way of indication and in nowise limitative, 1000 auxiliary alignment supports are formed from one silicon sheet; the holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are formed by boring of the sheet using a laser; the slots are formed using rough alignments in relation to the borings obtained by laser; every eleventh slot, the sheet is completely cut in order to demarcate the edges of the auxiliary support; the auxiliary supports are transferred into the spaces, or imprints, provided on the control circuit on which 1000 opto-electronic components comprising respectively these spaces or imprints have been hybrided; the ends of the optic fibres are inserted and fixed in the housings of the auxiliary alignment supports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be formed with only the slots and thus without the holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> when it is transparent to the light issued from the fibres and/or the active zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> We will now return to one of the applications of the invention, which was mentioned at the beginning of the present description. In order to optically pump the lasers, formed by the active zones of a first opto-electronic component, by other lasers, formed by the active zones of a second opto-electronic component, the second component just has to be coupled to the respective ends of the optic fibres, in the manner described and referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, and coupling in the same manner, the first component to the other ends of the fibres, this first component not then being hybrided to any control circuit in order to be able to emit light by its forward face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The present invention has various advantages concerning the solidity, the ease of formation of the slots with the required precision (generally &plusmn;1 &mgr;m) and the manufacturing cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As regards the solidity, the opto-electronic component is preferably hybrided onto the control circuit before the formation of the slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The assembly formed in this manner enables the component to have high solidity during this slot formation stage and to avoid any problem of breaking, which occurs with standard built up substrates, for example in gallium arsenide or indium phosphide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> As regards the facility of forming the slots, the cutting of accurate sides in the gallium arsenide may be controlled perfectly, unlike the manufacture of fibre guiding holes in such a material, by chemical engraving or plasma engraving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As regards the cost, the known techniques for manufacturing fibre guides all use photolithographic methods, which are extremely costly in terms of machines and time. They require, in fact, three successive operations, in particular a very long deep engraving operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The present invention allows, on the other hand, rapid manufacture of optic fibre guides, with a simple cutting machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the formation of holes in the substrate does not need precision and may be carried out by laser, which is not expensive. </paragraph>
