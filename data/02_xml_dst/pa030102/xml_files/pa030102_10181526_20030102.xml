<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a gas and steam turbine installation, having a waste-heat steam generator, which is connected downstream of a gas turbine on the combustion-gas side and whose heating surfaces are connected into the water/steam circuit of a steam turbine, and having a fuel system, which is connected upstream of the combustion chamber of the gas turbine and has a gasification device for fossil fuel and a gas line, which branches off from the gasification device and opens into the combustion chamber of the gas turbine. In this arrangement, the components provided for gas cleaning are usually connected into the gas line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such an installation is known, for example, from GB-A 2 234 984 or DE 198 32 294 C1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce the pollutant emission during the combustion of the gasified fossil fuel or synthesis gas, a saturator, in which the synthesis gas is charged with steam during operation of the installation, can be connected into the gas line. For this purpose, the synthesis gas flows through the saturator in counterflow to a flow of water, which is guided in a water circuit designated as a saturator circuit. In this arrangement, an input of heat from the water/steam circuit into the saturator circuit is provided for particularly high efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Due to the contact in the saturator with the heated flow of water guided in the saturation circuit, the gasified fuel is saturated with steam and experiences heating to a limited extent. For thermal technology reasons, and also for operational reasons, a further heating of the fuel by means of a heat exchanger can be necessary before its supply to the combustion chamber of the gas turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure particularly safe operation of the gas and steam turbine installation, it should be possible to stop a supply of the synthesis gas to the combustion chamber of the gas turbine at any time. For this purpose, a quick-action valve is usually connected into the gas line before the combustion chamber. If required, the quick-action valve blocks the gas line in a particularly short time so that no synthesis gas can reach the combustion chamber associated with the gas turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Because of the relevant technical safety regulations, the fuel system usually comprises a gas lock. A gas lock comprises two valves, for example ball cocks, which have to be opened or closed for a through-flow of gas. An intermediate relief system or a pressure line is connected between these two valves. The intermediate relief system can be connected to a flare by means of which the surface gas can be burned off. As an alternative to the intermediate relief system, it is possible to connect the pressure line, which ensures that no gas can flow in via the gas lock valves. The gas lock therefore separates, in a gas-tight manner, the fuel system into a first region, or the gasification system, upstream of the gas lock and into a second region, or the so-called gas turbine fuel system, downstream of the gas lock. Such a gas lock is known, for example, from Huth, M. et al.: &ldquo;Combustion of synthesis gas in gas turbines&rdquo;; BWK Brennstoff Warme Kraft, DE, VDI Verlag GmbH, D&uuml;sseldorf, Vol. 50, No. 9, 09.01.1998, pp. 35-39, XP 000777542 ISSN: 0006-9612. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A gas and steam turbine installation with a gasification device can be operated both with the synthesis gas, which is for example generated from coal or residual oil, and with a second fuel, such as natural gas. In the case of a change from synthesis gas to the second fuel, or vice versa, it is necessary for safety technology reasons to flush the region between the gas lock and the combustion chamber, i.e. the gas turbine fuel system, with an inert medium such as nitrogen or steam. Because of the large volume of the region to be flushed, which in the appropriate case also comprises the heat exchanger, flushing of this region is then required in both the forward and the rearward direction in order to achieve an almost complete displacement of the synthesis gas or of the second fuel and entering combustion gas, if necessary, out of the gas turbine fuel system. Flushing with pure nitrogen, however, is found to be uneconomic because of the magnitude of the volume to be flushed. Flushing with steam, on the other hand, presupposes the provision of steam so that the flushing procedure is, as a rule, dependent on the operation of the waste-heat steam generator of the steam turbine installation. In this arrangement, furthermore, either cooling of the steam extracted from the waste-heat steam generator or protection of the components from particularly high steam temperatures is necessary, so that the preparation for the flushing procedure is associated with a high level of complexity. In addition, complicated dewatering systems are necessary and the systems exposed to steam have to be protected from corrosion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The flushing concept, which comprises forward and rearward flushing, leads to a complex control concept during the flushing operation and to particularly complicated control modes for the operation of the installation. Such a flushing concept also leads to relatively long installation run-up and run-down times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on the object of specifying a gas and steam turbine installation of the type mentioned above in which, in the case of a change in the gas supplied to the combustion chamber of the gas turbine, the fuel system can be flushed in a particularly simple manner. A method is also to be specified which permits flushing of the fuel system of the gas and steam turbine installation in a particularly short time and in a particularly simple manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The object directed toward the gas and steam turbine installation is achieved, according to the invention, by a gas lock being connected into the gas line, the gas lock being arranged upstream of the combustion chamber and comprising a quick-action lock valve, a flushing line for steam-free flushing opening into the gas line downstream of the gas lock valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on the consideration that, in the case of a change to the gas to be supplied to the combustion chamber of the gas turbine, a displacement of the synthesis gas or of the second fuel, and combustion gas if necessary, from the fuel system can then be ensured in a particularly reliable manner if the volume to be flushed is small. In the case of a volume to be flushed which is small, furthermore, flushing in only one direction is found to be sufficient so that it is possible to dispense with complex control mechanisms for the flushing procedure. The flushing then takes place in the forward direction only, i.e. into the combustion chamber of the gas turbine. The flushing procedure can now be alternatively carried out with steam or nitrogen, for example pure nitrogen. Flushing with nitrogen is economic because of the small volume to be flushed. In addition, it is not then necessary to extract steam from the steam turbine installation for the flushing procedure, so that the overall efficiency of the gas and steam turbine installation is found to be particularly high. In addition, the system dispenses with the use of highly alloyed steels because no corrosion phenomena, or only slight corrosion phenomena, can appear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A small volume to be flushed can be achieved by a compact arrangement of the components. If the gas lock and the quick-action valve are arranged adjacent to one another, the quick-action valve can take over the function of one of the valves provided in the gas lock, so that this valve can be dispensed with and the volume of the gas turbine fuel system to be flushed is found to be particularly small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Ball cocks or ball valves, which exhibit a high level of gas-tightness, are usually employed as the valves for the gas lock. The quick-action valve is usually embodied as a quick-action flap. Depending on the size of the valve, however, any other rapidly closing fitting, such as a suitable valve, can be employed for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, a heat exchanger (which, if appropriate, is connected into the gas line) is connected upstream of the gas lock. This also reduces the volume to be flushed in the gas turbine fuel system. The primary side of the heat exchanger can, for example, be connected into the gas line between the gasification device and a saturator, which is likewise arranged upstream of the gas lock. With this arrangement, the heat exchanger transfers heat from the synthesis gas flowing to the saturator into the synthesis gas flowing from the saturator. Such a heat exchanger, which is also designated as a synthesis gas heat exchanger, therefore effects an at least partial thermal bypass of the saturator, so that the thermodynamic losses of the overall process are kept particularly small due to the heating of the synthesis gas by the synthesis gas. A particularly favorable heat exchange can be achieved by such an arrangement because&mdash;under the boundary condition of constant final temperature&mdash;a comparatively large quantity of heat can be transferred to the synthesis gas flowing out of the saturator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments are, of course, also conceivable as alternatives for the connection of the heat exchanger, such as the admission of hot feed water or steam in order to preheat the synthesis gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In order to mix the synthesis gas with nitrogen, a mixing appliance can be connected into the gas line upstream of the saturator provided for admitting steam to the synthesis gas. The addition of nitrogen to the synthesis gas is carried out to maintain particularly low NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>limiting values during the combustion of the synthesis gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A flushing line advantageously opens into the gas line immediately downstream of the gas lock valve. This ensures reliable flushing of the fuel system between the gas lock valve and the combustion chamber. Due to the compact construction of the fuel system, the flushing quantities necessary are found to be particularly small so that the operation of the installation is particularly economic. The employment of nitrogen or another inert medium for flushing the fuel system is particularly advantageous in comparison with flushing with steam because no dewatering of the line system, such as in the case of flushing with steam, is necessary. In addition, nitrogen or another inert medium can be made available independently of the operation of the water/steam system. In addition, nitrogen or the inert medium has a low temperature compared with steam extracted from the installation, so that it is possible to dispense with protection of the components from impermissibly high steam temperatures. Furthermore, there is no susceptibility to corrosion, or only slight susceptibility to corrosion, so that it is not necessary to employ highly alloyed steel. In principle, however, it is also possible to flush with steam, if available. In the case of nitrogen flushing, or flushing with some other inert medium apart from steam, an intermediate reservoir is advantageous. The intermediate reservoir ensures flushing even in the case of the failure of the system for providing the inert medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For almost complete conversion of the fossil fuel in the gasification device at high temperatures, a supply of oxygen from the air separation installation is usually provided. Nitrogen is then obtained. This nitrogen, in particular the pure nitrogen obtained, can now be used for flushing. For this purpose, the intermediate reservoir is advantageously connected via a supply line to the air separation installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A reserve line, which is connected at the inlet end to an emergency filling system for nitrogen, in particular pure nitrogen, advantageously opens into the supply line leading away from the air separation installation. This ensures, in a particularly reliable manner, flushing of the fuel system with nitrogen, in particular pure nitrogen, even in the case of the failure of the air separation installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The flushing system with intermediate reservoir, which is connected to an air separation installation if appropriate, can furthermore be employed even without the specific embodiment, presented above, of the gas lock in a gas and steam turbine installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With respect to the method for flushing the fuel system of a gas and steam turbine installation, the object is achieved, according to the invention, by the fuel system being flushed in the forward direction between the gas lock and the combustion chamber, i.e. in the direction of the combustion chamber. With only a forward flushing operation, the times for flushing are found to be particularly low, so that the change from synthesis gas to second fuel takes place in a particularly economic manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> If nitrogen is provided for flushing, this is advantageously extracted from the air separation installation. For this purpose, the nitrogen generated in the air separation installation, in particular as pure nitrogen, is supplied to the intermediate reservoir via the supply line. The pure nitrogen can then be fed, as required, from the intermediate reservoir into the gas line for flushing the fuel system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The fuel system is advantageously flushed between the combustion chamber and the gas lock in the forward direction using an inert flushing medium, which is supplied between the gas lock valve and the control valve. As in the case of the gas turbine fuel system, the gasification system must be flushed, because of the safety technology regulations, with an inert medium between the gasification device and the gas lock. For this purpose nitrogen, in particular pure nitrogen, or steam at the necessary pressure level, is usually employed as the inert medium. The concept and the boundary conditions for the flushing procedure depend on the gasification method employed.</paragraph>

The low-pressure stage <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises a low-pressure drum <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, which is connected to a heating surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, which is arranged in the waste-heat steam generator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and is configured as a low-pressure evaporator, in order to form a water/steam circulation <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. In order to remove low-pressure live steam F&Prime;, the low-pressure drum <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is connected to the transfer line <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> via a steam line <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, into which is connected a low-pressure superheater <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The water/steam circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the gas and steam turbine installation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> therefore comprises, in the embodiment example, three pressure stages <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As an alternative, however, fewer, in particular two, pressure stages can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The gas turbine installation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is designed for operation with a gasified raw gas or synthesis gas SG, which is generated by the gasification of a fossil fuel B. As the synthesis gas, gasified coal or gasified oil can, for example, be provided. For this purpose, the gas turbine installation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comprises a fuel system <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>, by means of which synthesis gas can be supplied to the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the gas turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>.

Coal, natural gas or oil can be supplied as the fossil fuel B to the gasification device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> via a charging system <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The gasification system <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> comprises, furthermore, components which are connected into the gas line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> between the gasification device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the gas turbine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In order to provide the oxygen O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>necessary for the gasification of the fossil fuel B, an air separation installation <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> associated with the gasification system <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> is connected upstream of the gasification device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> by means of an oxygen line <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. An airflow L, which is composed of a first partial flow T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a second partial flow T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, can be admitted at the inlet end to the air separation installation <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The first partial flow T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be extracted from the air compressed in the air compressor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, the air separation installation <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is connected at the inlet end to an extraction air line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which branches off from the compressed air line <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at a branch station <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. In addition, a further air line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> opens into the extraction air line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, into which further air line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> an additional air compressor <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is connected and via which further air line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> the second partial flow T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be supplied to the air separation installation <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment example, therefore, the total airflow L flowing to the air separation installation <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is composed of the partial flow T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> branched off from the compressed air line <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the airflow T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> supplied from the additional air compressor <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Such a connection concept is also designated a partially integrated installation concept. In an alternative embodiment, the so-called fully-integrated installation concept, it is possible to dispense with the further air line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> together with the additional air compressor <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, so that the air feed to the air separation installation <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> takes place completely by means of the partial flow T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> extracted from the compressed air line <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The synthesis gas SG flowing away from the gasification device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> initially passes, via the gas line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, into a synthesis gas waste-heat steam generator <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, in which a cooling of the synthesis gas SG takes place by heat exchange with a flow medium. High-pressure steam generated during this heat exchange is supplied, in a manner not shown in any futher detail, to the high-pressure stage <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the water/steam circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> After the synthesis gas waste-heat steam generator <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> and before a mixing appliance <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, viewed in the flow direction of the synthesis gas SG, a dust removal device <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> for the synthesis gas SG and a desulfurization installation <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> are connected into the gas line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, a soot washing appliance can also be provided instead of the dust removal device <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, in particular in the case of gasification of oil as the fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Charging of the gasified fuel with steam before entry into the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided for particularly low pollutant emission during the combustion of the gasified fuel in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In a particularly advantageous manner from the point of view of heat technology, this can take place in a saturator system. For this purpose, a saturator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, in which the gasified fuel is guided in counterflow to the heated saturator water, is connected into the gas line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In this arrangement, the saturator water circulates in a saturator circuit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the saturator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and into which are connected a circulating pump <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and for preheating the saturator water, a heat exchanger <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. In this arrangement, preheated feed water from the medium-pressure stage <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the water/steam circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is admitted to the primary side of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>.

In this arrangement, the primary side of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> is likewise connected into the gas line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> at a position before the dust removal installation <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, so that the synthesis gas SG flowing to the dust removal installation <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> transfers a part of its heat to the synthesis gas SG flowing away from the saturator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. In this arrangement, it is also possible to provide guidance of synthesis gas SG via the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> before its inlet into the desulfurization installation <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> even in the case of a connection concept which is modified with respect to the other components. In the case of the connection of a soot washing device, in particular, the synthesis gas side of the heat exchanger can be preferably arranged downstream of the soot washing device. </paragraph>

As an alternative, however, the water/steam drum <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> can also be connected in another appropriate manner, it being possible to supply the steam extracted from the water/steam drum <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to an auxiliary consumption unit as processed steam and/or as heating steam. In a further alternative embodiment, the secondary side of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> can also be directly connected to the low-pressure drum <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A flushing operation is necessary when running down the fuel system <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. This takes place in such a way that, in one or more steps, a first and a second region of the fuel gasification system <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> are separately flushed with nitrogen. The gasification system or the first region and the gas turbine fuel system&mdash;or the second region are then separated from one another by a gas lock <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the region <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. In this arrangement, the gasification system comprises the gasification device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> as far as the gas lock <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the gas turbine fuel system comprises the gas lock <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the components connected downstream, as far as the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the gas turbine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The gas lock <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is represented in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (an enlarged representation of the region <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>) and is arranged in the gas line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which may be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. The gas lock <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is arranged in the gas line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> after the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>.

Residual gas from the flushing operation, after the switching off of the gasification device or after the flushing of the saturator and the downstream heat exchanger, is led away via the exhaust gas line <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> upstream of the gas lock valve <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to a flare. The exhaust gas line <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, with associated valve, is used as a pressure relief system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> for the gas lock. The gas line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be shut off in a gas-tight manner by means of the gas lock <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and, if required, can be closed in a particularly short time by means of the quick-action valve <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Because the nitrogen reservoir <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is connected both to the air separation installation <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and to the emergency filling system <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, it can be charged both with pure nitrogen R&mdash;N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>from the air separation installation <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and with pure nitrogen R&mdash;N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>from the emergency filling system <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. Flushing of the gasification system <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> is therefore ensured particularly reliably even in the case of a failure of the air separation installation <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. In this arrangement, the nitrogen reservoir <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is dimensioned in such a way that it covers the pure nitrogen R&mdash;N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>requirement for the flushing procedure, including a sufficiently high reserve capacity.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The fuel system between the gas lock <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the gas turbine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is flushed in the forward direction with pure nitrogen R&mdash;N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. For this purpose, the pure nitrogen R&mdash;N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>generated in the air separation installation <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is supplied to the gas line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via the nitrogen line <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. Because of the small volume of this system, forward flushing with pure nitrogen R&mdash;N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is sufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Due to the compact embodiment of the gas lock <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, comprising a quick-action valve <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a pressure relief system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, connected to a flare, and a gas lock valve <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, together with the arrangement of the gas lock <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> downstream of the synthesis gas SG after the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, the flushing of the fuel system <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> necessary after the change of charge to the gas turbine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from synthesis gas SG to second fuel is particularly simple and can be carried out in a particularly short time. This is achieved by a comparatively small number, and a particularly favorable arrangement, of the components, so that the volume to be flushed is found to be particularly small. The flushing is also necessary when running down the gas and steam turbine installation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, it is found to be particularly favorable for nitrogen to be provided for flushing because the latter can be made available independently of the condition of the waste-heat steam generator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The gas and steam turbine installation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can, in consequence, be operated in a particularly reliable manner. </paragraph>
