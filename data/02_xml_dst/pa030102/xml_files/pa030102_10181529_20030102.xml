<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention concerns transparent, flame retardant, thermoformable, UV-stabilized, single layered or multilayered films, containing a cristallizable thermoplastic material, preferably polyethyleneterephthalate, at least one flame retarding agent and a UV stabilizer as main components. Said films are characterized by good stretchability, thermoformability and good optical and mechanical properties, which makes them and the shaped bodies made from said films suitable for both inner and outer applications. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Transparent, flame-retardant, thermoformable, UV-resistant film made from crystallizable thermoplastic, its use, and process for its production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a transparent, flame-retardant, thermoformable, UV-resistant, oriented film made from crystallizable thermoplastics, the thickness of which is preferably from 10 to 350 &mgr;m. The film comprises at least one flame retardant and one UV absorber and has good orientability and thermoformability, and has very good optical and mechanical properties, and can be produced cost-effectively. The invention further relates to the use of the film and to a process for its production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Transparent, oriented films made from crystallizable thermoplastics with thickness from 10 to 350 um are well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In these films, there is no UV absorber present as light stabilizer and there is no flame retardant, and the Films have insufficient thermoformability, the result being that neither the films nor the items and, respectively, moldings produced from them are suitable for indoor and/or outdoor applications where fire protection or, respectively, flame retardancy and thermoformability is demanded. The films do not meet the requirements for the fire tests to DIN 4102 Part 2 and Part 1 or the UL-94 test. Even after a short period in outdoor applications, these films exhibit yellowing and impairment of mechanical properties due to photooxidative degradation by sunlight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> EP-A-0 620 245 describes films whose thermal stability has been improved. These films comprise antioxidants suitable for scavenging free radicals formed within the film and degrading any peroxide formed. That specification does not propose how the UV resistance of these films might be improved. Nor does that specification state whether these films are suitable for thermoforming processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> DE-A 2346 787 describes-a flame-retardant polymer which has been phospholane-modified. Besides the polymer, its use for producing films and fibers is also claimed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The following shortcomings become apparent when this phospholane-modified polymer is used for film production: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The polymer is very susceptible to hydrolysis and has to be very effectively predried. When the polymer is dried using dryers of the prior art it cakes, and production of a film is therefore possible only under very difficult conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The films thus produced under uneconomic conditions embrittle when exposed to heat, i.e. their mechanical properties are severely impaired by the embrittlement, making the film unusable. This embrittlement occurs after as little as 48 hours of exposure to heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a transparent, flame-retardant, UV-resistant, thermoformable, oriented film with thickness preferably from 10 to 350 &mgr;m which is not only produced cost-effectively and has good orientability and good mechanical and optical properties but also in particular is flame-retardant, does not embrittle on exposure to heat, has good thermoformability, and has high UV resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Flame retardancy means that in what is known as a fire test the transparent film meets the conditions of DIN 4102. Part 2 and in particular the conditions of DIN 4102 Part 1 and can be allocated to construction materials class B2 and in particular B1 for low-flammability materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is also intended that the film pass the UL-94 test (Vertical Burning Test for Flammability of Plastic Material), permitting its grading in class 94 VTM-0. This means that 10 seconds after removal of the Bunsen burner the film has ceased to burn, after 30 seconds no smouldering is observed, and also no burning drops occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> High UV resistance means that sunlight or other UV radiation causes no, or only extremely little, damage to the films, and that the films or molding produced from them are therefore suitable for outdoor applications and/or critical indoor applications. In particular, after a number of years in outdoor applications the films are intended not to yellow nor to exhibit any embrittlement or surface cracking, nor to have any impairment of total mechanical properties. High UV resistance therefore means that the film absorbs UV light and does not transmit light until the visible region has been reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thermoformability means that the film can be thermoformed to give complex and large-surface-area moldings on commercially available thermoforming machinery without uneconomic predrying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Good optical properties include high light transmittance (&gt;80%), high surface gloss (&gt;100), extremely low haze (&lt;20%), and also low yellowness index (YI&lt;10). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Good mechanical properties include high modulus of elasticity (E<highlight><subscript>MD</subscript></highlight>&gt;3200 N/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>; E<highlight><subscript>TD</subscript></highlight>&gt;3500 N/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), and also good values for tensile stress at break (in MD&gt;100 N/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>; in TD&gt;130 N/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Good orientability includes the capability of the film to give excellent longitudinal and transverse orientation during its production, without break-offs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Cost-effective production includes the capability of the raw materials or raw material components needed to produce the flame-retardant film to be dried using familiar industrial dryers of the prior art. It is important that the raw materials do not cake and do not become thermally degraded. These industrial dryers of the prior art include vacuum dryers, fluidized-bed dryers; fixed-bed dryers (tower dryers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> These dryers operate at temperatures of from 100 to 170&deg; C., at which the flame-retardant polymers mentioned cake, making-film production impossible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the vacuum dryer which provides the mildest drying conditions, the raw material traverses a range of temperatures from about 30 to 130&deg; C. under a vacuum of 50 mbar. After this, what is known as post-drying is required, in a hopper at temperatures of from 100 to 130&deg; C., with a residence time of from 3 to 6 hours. Even here; the polymer mentioned cakes to an extreme degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> No embrittlement on exposure to heat means that after 100 hours of heat-conditioning at 100&deg; C. in a circulating-air oven, the film has not embrittled and does not have disadvantageous mechanical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is achieved by means of a transparent film with a preferred thickness in the range from 10 to 350 &mgr;m, which comprises a crystallizable thermoplastic as principal constituent, wherein the film comprises at least one UV absorber and at least one flame retardant. This is a mono or biaxially oriented film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The transparent film comprises a crystallizable thermoplastic as principal constituent. According to the invention, crystallizable thermoplastics are crystallizable homopolymers; crystallizable copolymers; crystallizable compounded materials; crystallizable recycled materials, and other types of crystallizable thermoplastics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Preferred suitable crystallizable or semicrystalline thermoplastics are polyesters, e.g. polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, and polyethylene naphthalate, preference being given to polyethylene terephthalate (PET). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is important for the invention that the crystallizable thermoplastic has a diethylene glycol content (DEG content) of &gE;1.0% by weight, preferably &gE;1.2% by weight, in particular &gE;1.3% by weight, and/or a polyethylene glycol content (PEG content) of &gE;1.0% by weight, preferably &gE;1.2% by weight, in particular &gE;1.3% by weight, and/or an isophthalic acid content (IPA)-of from 3 to 10% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It was more than surprising that by virtue of a higher diethylene glycol content and/or polyethylene glycol content and/or IPA content than in standard thermoplastics films can be thermoformed cost-effectively on commercially available thermoforming plants and provide excellent reproduction of detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to use mixtures of crystallizable thermoplastics. The crystallinities of the crystallizable thermoplastics are preferably in the range from 5 to 65%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The transparent film may be either single-layer or multilayer. The film may also have a coating of various copolyesters or adhesion promoters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the transparent film comprises at least one UV absorber and at least one flame retardant. The UV absorber is advantageously fed directly during film production by way of what is known as masterbatch technology, the concentration of the UV stabilizer preferably being from 0.01 to 5% by weight, in particular from 0.1 to 4% by weight, based on the weight of the layer of the crystallizable thermoplastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the flame retardant is fed directly during film production by way of what is known as masterbatch technology, the concentration being from 0.5 to 30% by weight, preferably from 1 to 20% by weight, based on the weight of the layer of the crystallizable thermoplastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Light, in particular the ultraviolet content of solar radiation, i.e. the wavelength region from 280 to 400 nm, induces degradation in thermoplastics, as a result of which their appearance changes due to color change or yellowing, and there is also an adverse effect on mechanical/physical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Inhibition of this photooxidative degradation is of considerable industrial and economic importance, since otherwise there are drastic limitations on the applications of many thermoplastics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The absorption of UV light by polyethylene terephthalates, for example, starts at below 360 nm, increases markedly below 320 nm and is very pronounced at below 300 nm. Maximum absorption occurs at between 280 and 300 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the presence of oxygen it is mainly chain cleavage which occurs, but there is no crosslinking. The predominant photooxidation products in quantity terms are carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and carboxylic acids. Besides the direct photolysis of the ester groups, consideration has to be given to oxidation reactions which likewise form carbon dioxide, via peroxide radicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the photooxidation of polyethylene terephthalate there can also be cleavage of hydrogen at the position &agr; to the ester groups, giving hydroperoxides and decomposition products of these, and this may be accompanied by chain cleavage (H. Day, D. M. Wiles: J. Appl. Polym. Sci 16, 1972, p. 203). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> UV stabilizers, i.e. light stabilizers which are LTV absorbers, are chemical compounds which can intervene in the physical and chemical processes of light-induced degradation. Carbon black and other pigments can give some protection from light. However, these substances are unsuitable for transparent films, since they cause discoloration or color change. The only compounds suitable for transparent matt films are those organic or organometallic compounds which produce no, or only extremely slight, color or color change in the thermoplastic to be stabilized, that is to say they are soluble in the thermoplastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of the present invention, UV stabilizers suitable as light stabilizers are those which absorb at least 70%, preferably 80%, particularly preferably 90%, of the UV light in the wavelength region from 180 to 380 nm, preferably from 280 to 350 nm. These are particularly suitable if they are thermally stable in the temperature range from 260 to 300&deg; C., that is to say they do not decompose and do not cause release of gases. Examples of UV stabilizers suitable as light stabilizers are 2-hydroxybenzophenones, 2-hydroxybenzotriazoles, organonickel compounds, salicylic esters, cinnamic ester derivatives, resorcinol monobenzoates, oxanilides, hydroxybenzoic esters, and sterically hindered amines and triazines, and among these preference is given to the 2-hydroxybenzotriazoles and the triazines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The UV stabilizer(s) is (are) preferably present in the outer layer(s). The core layer may also have UV stabilizer, if required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It was highly surprising that the use of the abovementioned UV stabilizers in films gave the desired result. The skilled worker would probably first have attempted to achieve a certain degree of UV resistance by way of an antioxidant, but would have found that the film rapidly yellows on weathering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the knowledge that UV stabilizers absorb UV light and therefore provide protection, the skilled worker would be likely to have used commercially available stabilizers. He would then have observed that </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> the UV stabilizer has unsatisfactory thermal stability and at temperatures of from 200 to 240&deg; C. decomposes and releases gases, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> large amounts (from about 10 to 15% by weight) of the UV stabilizer have to be incorporated so that the UV light is absorbed and the film therefore not damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> At these high concentrations it would have been observed that the film is already yellow just after it has been produced, with Yellowness Index deviations (YI) around 25. It would also have been observed that its mechanical properties are adversely affected. Orientation would have produced exceptional problems, such as </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> break-offs due to unsatisfactory strength, i.e. modulus of elasticity too low, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> die deposits, causing profile variations, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> roller deposits from the UV stabilizer, causing impairment of optical properties (defective adhesion, nonuniform surface), and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> deposits in stretching frames or heat-setting frames, dropping onto the film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It was therefore more than surprising that even low concentrations of the UV stabilizer achieve excellent UV protection. It was very surprising that, together with this excellent UV protection: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> within the accuracy of measurement, the Yellowness Index of the film is unchanged from that of an unstabilized film; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> there are no releases of gases, no die deposits and no frame condensation, and the film therefore has excellent optical properties and excellent profile and layflat, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> the UV-stabilized film has excellent stretchability, and can therefore be produced in a reliable and stable manner on high-speed film lines at speeds of up to 420 m/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The film of the invention comprises at least one flame retardant, which is fed by way of what is known as masterbatch technology directly during production of the film, and the amount of flame retardant here is from 0.5 to 30.0% by weight, preferably from 1.0 to 20.0% by weight, based on the weight of the layer of the crystallizable thermoplastic. The ratio of flame retardant to thermoplastic is generally kept at from 60:40 to 10:90% by weight during preparation of the masterbatch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Typical flame retardants include bromine compounds, chloroparaffins and other chlorine compounds, antimony trioxide, and aluminum trihydrates, but the use of the halogen compounds here is disadvantageous due to the occurrence of, halogen-containing byproducts. The low light resistance of films provided with these materials is moreover a great disadvantage, as is the evolution of hydrogen halides in the event of a fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Examples of suitable flame retardants used according to the invention are organophosphorus compounds, such as carboxyphosphinic acids, anhydrides of these and dimethyl methylphosphonate. A substantive factor according to the invention is that the organophosphorus compound is soluble in the thermoplastic, since otherwise the optical properties required are not complied with. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Since, the flame retardants generally have some susceptibility to hydrolysis, the additional use of a hydrolysis stabilizer may be desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The hydrolysis stabilizers used are generally amounts of from 0.01 to 1.0% by weight of phenolic stabilizers, the alkali metal/alkaline earth metal stearates and/or the alkali metal/alkaline earth metal carbonates. The amounts of phenolic stabilizers used are preferably from 0.05 to 0.6% by weight, in particular from 0.15 to 0.3% by weight, and their molar mass is preferably above 500 g/mol. Particularly advantageous compounds are pentaerythrityl tetrakis-3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate and 1,3,5-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)benzene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It was more than surprising, therefore, that by using masterbatch technology a suitable predrying and/or precrystallization procedure and, if desired, using small amounts of a hydrolysis stabilizer, it is possible to produce a flame-retardant, thermoformable film with the required property profile in a cost-effective manner and without any caking in the dryer, and that on exposure to high temperature the film does not become brittle, and does not break when folded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Within the accuracy of measurement, there is no adverse effect on the Yellowness Index of the film, compared with that of an unmodified film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> With this, the film of the invention is also cost effective. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment it is also possible for mixtures of the two UV stabilizers mentioned or mixtures of at least one of the two UV stabilizers with other UV stabilizers to be used, where the total concentration of light stabilizer is preferably from 0.01 to 50% by weight, based on the weight of crystallizable polyethylene terephthalate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> These data for flame retardant, UV stabilizer, and hydrolysis stabilizer are also valid for other thermoplastics to be used according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The surface gloss, measured to DIN 67530 (measurement angle: 20&deg;), is above 100, preferably above 120, the light transmittance L, measured to ASTM D 1003, is above 80%, preferably above 84%, and the haze of the film, measured to ASTM S 1003, is below 20%, preferably below 15%. These are surprisingly good properties for the UV resistance achieved in combination with the low flammability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The standard viscosity SV (DCA) of the polyethylene terephthalate, measured in dichloroacetic acid to DIN 53728, is from 600 to 1000, preferably from 700 to 900. The crystalline melting point measured by DSC with a heating rate of 10&deg; C./min is preferably in the range from 220 to 280&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The polyethylene terephthalate (PET) preferably has a diethylene glycol content (DEG content) and/or polyethylene glycol content (PEG content) greater than 1.3% by weight, in particular greater than 1.5% by weight. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the DEG content and/or PEG content is from 1.6 to 5% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It is surprising here that oriented PET films can be thermoformed by virtue of higher diethylene glycol content and/or polyethylene glycol content than that of standard polyester. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The thermoforming process generally encompasses the steps of predrying, heating, molding, cooling, demolding, and heat-conditioning. Surprisingly, during the thermoforming process it was found that the films of the invention can be thermoformed without predrying. This advantage drastically reduces the costs of the thermoforming process when comparison is made with thermoformed polycarbonate films or thermoformed polymethacrylate films, for which predrying times of from 10 to 15 hours at temperatures of from 100 to 120&deg; C. are required, depending on thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The film of the invention, preferably a PET film, which comprises at least one UV stabilizer and one flame retardant and is thermoformable, may be either a single-layer film or else a multilayer film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the multilayer embodiment, the film is composed of at least one core layer and of at least one outer layer, preference being given in particular to a three-layer, A-B-A or A-B-C structure. The thicknesses of the outer layers are preferably from 0.5 to 2 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> For this embodiment it is important that the standard viscosity and the DEG content and/or PEG content of the crystallizable thermoplastic, e.g. the polyethylene tereplithalate, of the core layer are similar to those of the polyethylene terephthalate or the thermoplastic of the outer layer(s) which is/are adjacent to the core layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In one particular embodiment, the outer layers, too, may be composed of a polyethylene naphthalate homopolymer or of a polyethylene terephthalate-polyethylene naphthalate copolymer, or of a compounded material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the standard viscosity of the thermoplastics of the outer layers is likewise similar to that of, for example, the polyethylene terephthalate of the core layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the multilayer embodiment, the UV absorber is preferably present in the outer layers. If required, UV absorber may also be provided in the core layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the multilayer embodiment, the flame retardant is preferably present in the core layer. If required, flame retardant may also be provided in the outer layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, flame retardant and UV absorber may also be present in the outer layers. If required and if fire protection requirements are stringent, the core layer may also have what is known as a base level of flame retardant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Unlike in the single-layer embodiment, the concentration of the flame retardant and of the UV stabilizer here is based on the weight in the modified layer. The concentration ranges are identical with those in the base layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Very surprisingly, weathering tests to the ISO 4892 test specification using the Atlas CI65 Weather-Ometer have shown that in order to improve the UV resistance of a three-layer film it is entirely sufficient for the outer layers of preferred thickness from 0.5 to 2 &mgr;m to be provided with UV stabilizers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Again surprisingly, fire tests to DIN 4102 Part 1 and Part 2, and also the UL-94 test, have shown that the films of the invention comply with these requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The flame-retardant, UV-resistant, thermoformable, multilayer films, produced by known coextrusion technology, are therefore of greater economic interest than monofilms provided with UV stabilizer and flame retardant throughout, since less additives are needed for comparable flame retardancy and UV resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> At least one side of the film may also have been provided with a scratch-resistant coating, with a copolyester, or with an adhesion promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Weathering tests have shown that even after from 5 to 7 years (extrapolated from the weathering tests) in outdoor applications the films of the invention generally have no increased yellowing, no embrittlement, no loss of surface gloss, no surface cracking, and no impairment of mechanical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> During production of the film of the invention it was moreover found that the film can be oriented longitudinally and transversely without break-offs. Furthermore, no evolution of gas from the UV stabilizer or flame retardant were found during the production process, and this is very advantageous, since most UV stabilizers and flame retardants exhibit problematic evolution of gases at extrusion temperatures above 260&deg; C., as a result of which they cannot be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly, compliance of the films of the invention with construction materials class B1 to DIN 4102 Part 1 and with the UL-94 test extends as far as thicknesses in the range from 5 to 350 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the production of the film of the invention it was moreover found that the flame retardant can be incorporated by way of masterbatch technology with suitable predrying or precrystallization of the flame retardant masterbatch, without caking in the dryer permitting cost-effective film production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> It was more than surprising that a low concentration of an added hydrolysis stabilizer in the flame retardant masterbatch further facilitates incorporation, so that throughputs and therefore production rates can be increased without difficulty. In one very specific embodiment, the film also comprises small amounts of a hydrolysis stabilizer in the layers provided with flame retardant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Measurements have moreover shown that the film of the invention does not embrittle on exposure to heat at 100&deg; C. over a prolonged period. This result is attributed to the synergistic action of appropriate precrystallization, predrying, masterbatch technology, and provision of UV stabilizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The film may moreover be thermoformed without predrying, and can therefore be used to produce complex moldings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Examples of process parameters found for the thermoforming process were as follows:

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The film or, respectively, the molding of the invention can moreover be recycled without difficulty, without pollution of the environment, and without loss of mechanical properties, and is therefore suitable for use as short-lived advertising placards, for example, in the construction of exhibition stands, and for other promotional items, where fire protection and thermoformability is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> An example of a method of producing the film of the invention is the extrusion process on an extrusion line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the flame retardant is added here, where appropriate with the hydrolysis stabilizer, by way of masterbatch technology. The flame retardant is dispersed in a carrier material. Carrier materials which may be used are the thermoplastic itself, e.g. the polyethylene terephthalate, or else other polymers compatible with the thermoplastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The light stabilizer may advantageously be fed before the material leaves the thermoplastic polymer producer, or may be metered into the extruder during film production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> It is particularly preferable to add the light stabilizer by way of masterbatch technology. The light stabilizer is dispersed in a solid carrier material. Carrier materials which may be used are certain resins, the thermoplastic itself, e.g. the polyethylene terephthalate, or else other polymers sufficiently compatible with the thermoplastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The DEG content and/or PEG content of the polyethylene terephthalate are advantageously set at the premises of the polymer producer during the polycondensation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In masterbatch technology it is important that the grain size and the bulk density of the masterbatch is similar to the grain size and the bulk density of the thermoplastic, permitting uniform distribution and therefore also uniform UV resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The films of the invention may be produced by known processes, e.g. from a polyester with, where appropriate, other raw materials, e.g. the TV absorber and/or other conventional additives in conventional amounts of from 1.0 to a maximum of 30% by weight, either in the form of a monofilm or else in the form of multilayer, where appropriate coextruded films with identical or differently constructed surfaces, where one surface may, for example, have been pigmented but no pigment is present at the other surface. Known processes may also have been used to provide one or both surfaces of the film with a conventional functional coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> A substantive factor for the invention is that the masterbatch which comprises the flame retardant and, if used, the hydrolysis stabilizer, is precrystallized or predried. This predrying includes gradual heating of the masterbatch at reduced pressure (from 20 to from 40 to 50 mbar), with agitation, and, if desired, post-drying at a constant, elevated temperature, again at reduced pressure. It is preferable for the masterbatch to be charged at room temperature from a metering vessel in the desired blend together with the polymers of the base and/or outer layers and, if desired, with other raw material components batchwise into a vacuum dryer in which the temperature profile moves from 10 to 160&deg; C., preferably from 20 to 150&deg; C., in particular from 30 to 130&deg; C., during the course of the drying time or residence time. During the residence time of about 6 hours, preferably 5 hours, in particular 4 hours, the raw material mixture is stirred at from 10 to 70 rpm, preferably from 15 to 65 rpm, in particular from 20 to 60 rpm. The resultant precrystallized or predried raw material mixture is post-dried in a downstream vessel, likewise evacuated, at temperatures of from 90 to 180&deg; C., preferably from 100 to 170&deg; C., in particular from 110 to 160&deg; C., for from 2 to 8 hours, preferably from 3 to 7 hours, in particular from 4 to 6 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In the preferred extrusion process for producing a polyester film of the invention, the molten polyester material is extruded through a slot die and quenched on a chill roll, in the form of a substantially amorphous prefilm. This amorphous prefilm is then reheated and stretched longitudinally and transversely, or transversely and longitudinally, or longitudinally, transversely and again longitudinally and/or transversely. In general, the stretching temperatures are from T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>&plus;10&deg; C. to T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>&plus;60&deg; C. (where Tg is the glass transition temperature, the longitudinal stretching ratio is usually from 2 to 6, in particular from 3 to 4.5, and the transverse stretching ratio is from 2 to 5, in particular from 3 to 4.5, and the ratio for any second longitudinal or transverse stretching carried out is from 1.1 to 5. The first longitudinal stretching may, if desired, be carried out simultaneously with the transverse stretching (simultaneous stretching). This is followed by the heat-setting of the film at oven temperatures of from 180 to 260&deg; C., in particular from 220 to 250&deg; C. The film is then cooled and wound up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The surprising combination of excellent properties makes the film of the invention and moldings produced therefrom highly suitable for a variety of different applications, such as interior decoration, for constructing exhibition stands, for exhibition requisites, for displays, for placards, for protective glazing of machines or vehicles, in the lighting sector, in fitting out shops or stores, or as a promotional requisite,, laminating material, for greenhouses, roofing systems, exterior cladding, protective coverings, applications in the construction sector, illuminated advertizing profiles, blinds, or electrical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The thermoformability of the film of the invention makes it suitable for thermoforming any desired moldings for indoor or outdoor applications. The examples, below illustrate the invention in more detail. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> To obtain homogeneous distribution, 0.2% by weight of Sylobloc is incorporated directly into the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) when the polymer is prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The polyethylene terephthalate from which the transparent film is produced has a standard viscosity SV (DCA) of 810, corresponding to an intrinsic viscosity TV (DCA) of 0.658 dl/g. Both DEG content and PEG content are 1.6% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> &reg;Tinuvin 1577. has a melting point of 149&deg; C. and is thermally stable up to about 330&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The UV stabilizer &reg;Tinuvin 1577 is fed in the form of a masterbatch. The masterbatch is composed of 5% by weight of &reg;Tinuvin 1577 as active ingredient and 95% by weight of PET having a standard viscosity SC (DCA)&equals;810, corresponding to an intrinsic viscosity IV (DCA) of 0.658 dl/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The flame retardant is the organophosphorus compound dimethyl methylphosphonate, &reg;Amgard P 1045 from Albright &amp; Wilson, which is soluble in PET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The flame retardant is likewise fed in the form of a masterbatch. The masterbatch is composed of 20% by weight of flame retardant and 80% by weight of PET having a standard viscosity SV (DCA) of 810. </paragraph>
