<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a dispenser for foamable liquids which has been improved with regard to the aspects of hygiene and reliability. According to the method, in addition to the pneumatic and hydraulic parts of the dispenser having a configuration which is to a great extent isolated from the external atmosphere, said dispenser has an air chamber (<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>) which subjects a nozzle/expansion body (<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>) first to an excess pressure and then to a negative pressure during the return stroke (H<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) of an air piston (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) via a lateral bore (<highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>). As a result, the outlet (<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) is first cleared and any remaining foam in the nozzle/expansion body (<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>) is subsequently removed by suction and coagulated into soap solution. During the next working stroke, this minimal quantity of soap-solution is foamed again and expelled. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method of dispensing foam and to an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 and claim 4, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Foam dispensers of that kind are frequently used in washrooms and toilets, especially of public facilities, restaurants, etc.. They are also found in areas having high hygiene requirements, such as the food industry, healthcare etc., where they are often operated with soap solutions that contain disinfectants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> WO 90/14037, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, discloses a concentrically constructed foam dispenser that sucks in air from the dispenser housing via a non-return valve, compresses it and, at the same, feeds soap solution out of an intermediate vessel. The two media are combined in a mixing chamber; the coarse-bubbled foam formed therein is subsequently homogenised by means of a foamer and expelled for hand washing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The known apparatus is relatively bulky and consists of numerous individual parts which in time become soiled and clog and/or contaminate the dispenser. In addition, it has a tendency to drip since, in the mixing chamber and in the dispenser, the residual foam collapses to some extent and, especially during prolonged breaks in operation, agglutinates to some extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is therefore to provide a method for controlled foam production and delivery and to construct a foam dispenser that does not have the disadvantages of the prior art and, in particular, does not have a tendency to drip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The dispenser to be provided is to be reliable in operation and provide improved hygiene conditions. It is intended to have a large intermediate vessel with an easily visible filling level indicator so that sufficient time is available in every case to replace the empty supply bottle with a new, filled supply bottle. In addition, the dispenser is to be economic to manufacture and is to require a minimum of maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the object is achieved by the features of claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the method, in the first phase, after the formation and dispensing of the foam, the dispensing nozzle is blown clear; in the second phase, a slight negative pressure is produced there, which destroys the remaining foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The liquid lamellae forming the foam undergo expansion as a result of the back-suction (negative pressure) and, owing to their thermodynamic instability, are broken up at the inner surface of a nozzle/expansion body, that is to say, a minimum amount of soap solution is produced there which, with the next positive stroke of the piston, is foamed again and expelled (with the foam portion). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As a result of that measure, the nozzle space always remains clean; it does not become encrusted and therefore the dispenser is capable of operating even after long breaks in operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Developments of the subject-matter of the invention are characterised in dependent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The method according to claim 2 can be integrated very easily into existing constructions of air cylinders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The development according to claim 3 is a solution that is especially interesting from an economic viewpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Residual foam present in the foam delivery bore is successfully destroyed by an expansion upstream, with the result that no dripping occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The apparatus according to claim 5 has the advantage of a very hygienic and operationally reliable construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Passing over a single air passage, which is mentioned in claim 6, is especially efficient and replaces the valves, air directing means, air guides, stepped piston rods for temporary air supply etc. which are required in other conceivable constructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The embodiment according to claim 7 is especially effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The construction according to claim 8 prevents the ingress of germs etc. into the dispenser and ensures a decisive improvement in hygiene conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The embodiment according to claim 9 serves to prevent the supply vessels from being confused with one another; it increases operating reliability and serves to ensure that suitable soap solutions are used, especially in critical areas (food production and distribution, healthcare etc.). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The float <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown in its entirety in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The lug <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; projects from a float body <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, while sectional guide members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having grooves are arranged on both sides of the body <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Further details of the dispenser shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> can be seen from the view in section given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In that Figure, the lower part of the supply vessel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shown in its entirety. A bottle neck <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> placed on it in a liquid-tight manner, which part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> identifies and keys the bottle. In the interior of the bottle neck <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a pierced diaphragm <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be seen, which serves as the bottle closure. Piercing is effected, upon insertion of the vessel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, by the piercing sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the adapter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is matched in shape to the keying part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Upon insertion of the supply vessel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a projection provided on the bottle neck <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is thrust onto a hemispherical closure plug <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, moves the latter away from the valve seat <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and opens the passage for the soap solution, with the result that the level illustrated is obtained, which is kept constant by a topped-up air space L. The closure plug <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is integrally provided, via a spring plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, with two mounting pins <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> lying opposite each other and is inserted in the closure lid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It will also be seen that the float <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> slides upward along a guide ledge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> as soon as there is soap solution in the intermediate vessel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The soap solution is able to pass via a soap passage <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and a passage pin <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to a floating non-return valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is arranged at the top of the soap-metering cylinder <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. At the opposite end, there is a further non-return valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; which is pressed against its upper valve seat by a valve spring <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Below that, a foamer <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> can be seen, which is terminated by a nozzle/expansion body <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and is provided with an oblique-angled delivery bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the air cylinder <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, an axially displaceable air piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be seen, which is formed integrally with the piston rod <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and a soap solution piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> arranged at the front. Two bores can also be seen in the air cylinder <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the radial bore being an air passage <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> to the nozzle/expansion body <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the axial bore being an air passage <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> to the foamer <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The rear end of the piston rod <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is inserted between two lateral guides <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and has a bearing pin <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> which is engaged laterally in a pressing cam <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. By means of that non-positive coupling, the piston rod <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is guided horizontally by the operating lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the &plus; and &minus; direction (cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>); the forward end position of the lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is indicated by a dot-dash line. Also to be seen is the spring <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that is towards the front as viewed by the observer and which, in the manner of a plate spring, causes the lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be returned to its rear end position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The individual parts of the foamer and the construction of the nozzle/expansion body <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be seen on a larger scale in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In addition to that which has been shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> valve ball <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a plug <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> having a central passage, and a pipe piece <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which serves to guide the spring <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> can be seen. In the lower portion of the foamer <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, but still arranged therein, a foam divider <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can be seen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Further individual parts of the foamer <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> can be seen from the enlarged views shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A pre-foaming chamber <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> formed as three-dimensional surface will be seen, which can be supplied with compressed air through the channels <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which serve to guide the air; the metered soap solution is supplied, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, from the top to an outer casing space <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The foaming principle is well known as such, as are the diaphragm screen <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> at the lower end of the foamer <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, which serves for refining and homogenisation, and the foam divider <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The plan view of the foamer <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> shows, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, well-known foam nozzles through which the compressed air forces the foam formed in the pre-foaming chamber <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> from above through the air guides <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The air cylinder <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> shown diagrammatically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>makes it possible to see its mode of operation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A forward stroke H<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>which serves to foam the soap solution is effective from when the air piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> passes over the radial air passage <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>; over the stroke path H, the pressure curve p shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is produced, up to a maximum value of the effective pressure P<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>That effective pressure P<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>is delivered to the attached foamer via the axial air passage <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> On the backward stroke H<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, the pressure curve shown by a dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is produced, up to a maximum value P<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>which is reached before the air passage <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is crossed. Thereafter, the pressure p falls and changes its sign after the piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> passes over the air passage <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. That part of the backward stroke is designated H<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight>and assumes a relatively small maximum negative pressure &minus;P<highlight><subscript>S</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It can thus be seen from the two Figures that the nozzle/expansion body <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which is in communication with the air passage <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is first blown out via the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and that, subsequently, a back-suction occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A preferred construction of an air cylinder <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> with foamer <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and nozzle/expansion body <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is shown in half in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the construction according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>only a single air passage <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is provided.&mdash;In addition to a radial passage <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, the variant according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> has channels <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> that are also connected to the nozzle/expansion body <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the single air passage <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is constructed analogously to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>; the backward stroke H<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>and the further backward stroke H<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight>are also shown. In keeping with the end position of the air piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the back-suction direction characterised by arrows is designated &minus;p. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The physical effect of the back-suction can be seen by reference to the nozzle/expansion body <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As soon as a negative pressure occurs in the air cylinder <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the soap foam that remains in the slot-shaped space formed between the lower end of the foamer <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the nozzle/expansion body <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is sucked back through that space, meets the baffle projection <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and, owing to the subsequent increase in surface area, condenses in the form of small soap droplets on a drainage surface <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and drains into the annular valve/drop chamber <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When a subsequent positive stroke occurs, the air stream passes through the air passage <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, via the upper expansion chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, onto the impact head <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, and produces foam in the drop chamber <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> once more; because of the longer distance and the lower pressure, this is then expelled through the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> approximately simultaneously with the foam generated by the working stroke H<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The filling of the air cylinder which is necessary for the working stroke H<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>is effected to a very great extent via the air inlet valve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, since the latter offers significantly lower flow resistance than the labyrinthine configuration of the by-pass at and in the nozzle/expansion body <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The same applies also upon delivery of the foam; no premature sucking-back of the metered foam is perceptible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The subject-matter according to the invention represents a considerable improvement in terms of its reliability, cleanliness and hygiene in comparison with the prior art mentioned at the beginning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the freely selectable and more constant stroke rates which are obtained in electromechanically driven dispensers, the subject-matter of the invention can be further optimised and in that case exhibits additional action during back-suction. </paragraph>
