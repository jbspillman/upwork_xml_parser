<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention is devised to provide an XSR cable connector with satisfactory extraneous emission performance. An outer conductor (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of a cable (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) extends from the inside to the outside of a chuck (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) through the space between an outer jacket (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of the cable and the rear end portion (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) of the chuck (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) so as to be interposed between the outer peripheral surface of the chuck (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) and the inner peripheral surface of a housing (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). Hence, the outer conductor (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the cable is in contact with the inner peripheral surface of the housing (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) not at a point but on a surface for conduction, allowing the housing to be at the same potential as that of the outer conductor in terms of high frequency waves, remarkably improving extraneous emission of high frequency harmonics nose from the side of the housing as compared with the prior art. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an XSR cable connector generally used in the field of audio products for professional use. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A typical XSR cable connector is configured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. Here, a male XSR cable connector will be described as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a twist pair cable formed of wires <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R and an outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that shields the same wires, and the outside of the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is protected by an outer jacket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The XSR cable connector is assembled as follows: the wires <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>L and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R are soldered to male contacts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of an insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is soldered to a male contact <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a leaf spring terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inserted from the rear of a housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> made of conductive metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> At this point, a chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> made of insulating resin covers the rear of the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A slit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed on the side of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and a tapered part <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed on the rear end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, an internal thread <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a bushing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is inserted to the rear of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and is made of insulating resin, is screwed onto an external thread <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Hence, a leading end of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the tapered part <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the rear end of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is pressed by an inner peripheral surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the bushing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and a rear end portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> catches and holds the outer jacket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the above conventional configuration, as shown in the state of assembling in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected to the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the leaf spring terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, which is in contact with a part of the inner periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the rear of the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is surrounded by the rear of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is connected to the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the leaf spring terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, since a handled signal has increased in frequency as audio video systems have recently improved in quality, improvement in high frequency characteristics has been demanded for XSR cable connectors under the present circumstances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a specific example, the following example will be discussed: a baseband signal receives a digital signal of 6 MHz (6 Mbps) via an XSR cable connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Considering the state of assembling in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> at the above handled frequency, the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at the rear of the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has insufficient shielding effect, and an undesired signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be leaked from this part to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when frequency components of the undesired signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are examined, it is found that the leakage of high frequency harmonics nose is noticeable. This is because a contact point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the leaf spring terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is only one secure contact point of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a rear A of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in terms of high frequency harmonics nose is equivalent to an antenna grounded at the contact point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the undesired signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also emitted from the side of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be discussed in accordance with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Here, the members having the same functions as those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, which illustrate the prior art, will be indicated by the same reference numerals in the following explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate Embodiment 1 of the-present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In Embodiment 1, as in the prior art, a cable having an outer conductor composed of a single braided wire is used as a cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> First, explanation will be made in accordance with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), in the assembling process, after the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is soldered to an insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as in the prior art, a braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> being separate from the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed over the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> And then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), an end of the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is soldered to an outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At this point, soldering is carried out after tying is. performed by using a tinned wire <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> And then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is mounted on the rear of the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> passes through the space between an outer jacket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a rear end portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and is drawn from the inside to the outside of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the drawn braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is folded on the outer peripheral surface of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the folded braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted into a housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> together with the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so as to be interposed between the outer peripheral surface of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and a bushing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is screwed onto the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so that the assembling is completed. Here, an interval is small between the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed in the interval therebetween, the interposed braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed between the outer peripheral surface of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is pressed over the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. With this configuration, conduction is produced on the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to surround the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Hence, the rear of the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is shielded more surely than the prior art by the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> soldered to an outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Here, as to a reduction in extraneous emission of high frequency harmonics nose, an important point is that the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> not only at a contact point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a leaf spring terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>but also is in contact with the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to be brought into conduction. Thus, it is possible to allow the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to be at the same potential as that of the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in terms of high frequency waves, thereby remarkably improving extraneous emission of high frequency harmonics nose from the side of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as compared with the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to obtain workability when the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and to further reduce extraneous emission, when the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), a conductive tape <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having an adhesive layer on one surface is wound around the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is folded on the outer peripheral surface of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, while a conducting surface is disposed outside. The conducting surface on an end of the wound conductive tape <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are brought into conduction via solder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and so on, and the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in a state in which the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is temporarily fixed so as not to be rolled up when the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this case, the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is brought into conduction on the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the conductive tape <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, thereby obtaining the same high frequency performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the example of the conductive tape <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the above embodiment, the conducting surface of the conductive tape and the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are in contact with each other via the adhesive layer of the conductive tape <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so that conduction is not performed. Hence, the conducting surface on the end of the wound conductive tape <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are brought into conduction via the solder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and so on. Here, when a conductive tape is used which has conductive particles mixed in an adhesive layer, it is possible to eliminate the necessity for the solder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and it can be expected that the high frequency performance will further improve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> show Embodiment 2 of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 2 is different from Embodiment 1 only in that a cable having an outer conductor composed of a double braided wire is used as a cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> To be specific, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is composed of an outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the inside and an outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the outside. The outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is soldered to a male contact <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a leaf spring terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of an insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is folded to the rear so as to overlap an outer jacket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> And then, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is mounted on the rear of the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is folded on the outer peripheral surface of the chuck as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Besides, the folded outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> together with the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so as to be interposed between the outer peripheral surface of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and a bushing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is screwed onto the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so that assembling is completed. Here, an interval is small between the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is disposed in the interval therebetween, the interposed outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is disposed between the outer peripheral surface of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is pressed over the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, conduction is produced on the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so as to surround the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Hence, the rear of the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is shielded more surely than the prior art by the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Here, as to a reduction in extraneous emission of high frequency harmonics nose, an important point is that the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> not only at a contact point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the leaf spring terminal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>but also is brought into conduction on the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Thus, it is possible to allow the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to be at the same potential as that of the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in terms of high frequency waves, thereby remarkably improving extraneous emission of high frequency harmonics nose from the side of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as compared with the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to obtain workability when the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and to further reduce extraneous emission, when the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), a conductive tape <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having an adhesive layer on one surface is wound around the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which is folded on the outer peripheral surface of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, while a conducting surface is disposed outside. The conducting surface on an end of the wound conductive tape and the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are brought into conduction via solder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and so on, and the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in a state in which the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is temporarily fixed so as not to be rolled up when the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In this case, the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is brought into conduction on the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via the. outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the conductive tape <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, thereby obtaining the same high frequency performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the example of the conductive tape <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the above embodiment, the conducting surface of the conductive tape and the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are in contact with each other via the adhesive layer of the conductive tape <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so that conduction is not obtained. Hence, the conducting surface on the end of the wound conductive tape and the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are brought into conduction via the solder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and so on. Here, when a conductive tape is used which has conductive particles mixed in an adhesive layer, it is possible to eliminate the necessity for the solder and further improve the high frequency performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 3 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows Embodiment 3 of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Although the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 2 is made of insulating resin as the prior art, a chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 3. is made of a conductive material, and an outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>drawn from the inside to the outside of the chunk <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is simply interposed between an outer jacket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of a cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a rear end portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and is not folded on the outer periphery of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is somewhat larger in diameter than that of Embodiment 2, and the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is pressed over the inner periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in a state in which the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> together with the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Further, a bushing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted on the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so that the rear end portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> catches and holds an outer jacket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Thus, the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> made of a conductive material and the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are more surely brought into conduction, and an outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is brought into conduction on the inner periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, thereby obtaining the same high frequency performance as Embodiment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is entirely made of a conductive material in Embodiment 3. The same high frequency performance as Embodiment 2 can also be obtained in the following configuration: the outer peripheral surface of Embodiment 2 that is made of insulating resin is formed, a conductive plated film is continuously formed from the inner surface of the rear end portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to the outer peripheral surface of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is brought into conduction on the inner periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the conductive plated film formed on the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the examples of Embodiment 3, the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is somewhat larger in diameter than that of Embodiment 2, and the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is pressed over the inner periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in a state in which the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> together with the insert <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The following configuration is also applicable: the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is equal in diameter to that of Embodiment 2, the conductive tape used in Embodiment 2 is wound around the outer periphery of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the outer periphery of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is pressed over the inner periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via the conductive tape. Moreover, in the case where the conductive tape is wound thus around the outer periphery of the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the same effect can be expected by winding the conductive tape around the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>folded on the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Also, the same effect can be expected by winding the conductive tape around the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> instead of folding the outer conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the chuck <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Besides, in Embodiment 3, a cable having an outer conductor composed of a double braided wire is used as the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Like Embodiment 1, the combination of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which has an outer conductor composed of a single braided wire, and the braided wire <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is also applicable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in the above described embodiments, a male XSR cable connector was described as an example, and the above description also holds for a female XSR cable connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the XSR cable connector of the present invention, the outer conductor of the cable or the conductor connected to the outer conductor extends from the inside to the outside of the chuck through the space between the outer jacket of the cable and the rear end portion of the chuck so as to be interposed between the outer peripheral surface of the chuck and the inner peripheral surface of the housing and so as to be in contact with the housing. Thus, the outer conductor of the cable is in contact with the inner peripheral surface of the housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> not at point but on a surface for conduction, allowing the housing to be at the same potential as that of the outer conductor in terms of high frequency waves, remarkably improving extraneous emission of high frequency harmonics nose from the side of the housing as compared with the prior art. </paragraph>
