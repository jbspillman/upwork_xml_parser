<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an advertisement-attached information providing apparatus and method for providing information, including images, text and voice, attached with an advertisement. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recent years have witnessed the emergence of paid information providing services in which information in the form of, e.g., images, voice and text, is transmitted via the Internet or information kiosks (information vending machines) to devices such as, e.g., mobile phones, mobile terminals and personal computers for an information or services fee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is known from Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) 9-114755 that a discount in the fee is provided by outputting an advertisement when the information is utilized, so that the fee for the use of the information providing services as mentioned above can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the advertisement-attached information providing services according to the prior art, however, though the system or mechanism concerning the discount of the fee charged to the user is indicated, the system concerning the setting of the fee charged to the advertiser who provides the advertisement is not. Thus, for example, when an advertisement fee is determined in accordance with the period in which the advertisement-attached information is provided, the advertiser had to pay a set advertisement fee even when the quantity of the advertisement-attached information that was provided was less than what the advertiser had hoped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, when the server providing advertisement-attached information stores the quantity of the advertisement-attached information that has been provided, and the advertiser is charged an advertisement fee proportional to that quantity at certain intervals (e.g., every month), the advertiser may have to pay an advertisement fee which far exceeds what he had expected if the quantity of the information provided far exceeds expectations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In addition, since there is no indication of the association between the advertisement provided by the advertiser and the user who views the advertisement, it is difficult for the advertiser to target his advertisement to certain users. In view of these problems of the prior art, it is a major objective of the present invention to provide an advertisement-attached information providing apparatus which enables the advertiser to provide certain users with a quantity of advertising commensurate with the advertisement fee the advertiser paid, and which enables the user to obtain a discount in the fee. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome the problems of the prior art, the present invention provides an advertisement-attached information providing apparatus for providing information attached with an advertisement, wherein the advertisement attached to the information is determined based on at least two pieces of information selected from the group consisting of advertisement desired information included in the information, user taste information included in the advertisement, and user information about a user who purchases the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, at least two pieces of information selected from the group consisting of each item of the advertisement desired information about the type of advertisement a provider of information wishes to be attached to the information, each item of the user taste information indicating the characteristics of a user by whom the one providing an advertisement wants the advertisement to be viewed, and the user information about the user who purchases the information, are compared, and then an advertisement with the most corresponding items is selected. Accordingly, an appropriate advertisement in accordance with the content of the information can be attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides an advertisement-attached information providing apparatus, wherein the advertisement carries an advertisement unit price which, corresponding to an advertisement fee, is incurred every time the advertisement is attached to the information, and the information is provided for a fee which is the price of the information minus the advertisement unit price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, since the advertisement data to be attached to the information comprises advertisement unit price data, the advertiser can set an advertisement fee commensurate with the quantity of advertisement attached to the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention provides an advertisement-attached information providing apparatus, wherein the advertisement further comprises data indicating an upper-limit price for the advertisement fee, and the attachment of the advertisement is halted when the total of the advertisement unit price, which is incurred every time the advertisement is attached to the information, exceeds the upper-limit price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the advertisement data to be attached to the information comprises upper-limit price data for the advertisement fee to be paid by the advertiser, and the attachment of the advertisement is halted when the total of the advertisement unit fee, which is incurred every time the advertisement is attached to the information, exceeds the upper-limit price. Accordingly, the advertiser is spared from being charged with a fee exceeding a preset advertisement fee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention provides an advertisement-attached information providing apparatus, wherein the advertisement further comprises data indicating an advertisement period, and the attachment of the advertisement is halted when the time or date of attaching the advertisement to the information has passed the advertisement period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, since the advertisement data to be attached to the information comprises data indicating an advertisement distribution period, an advertisement with a certain effective period can be effectively distributed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides an advertisement-attached information providing method for providing information attached with an advertisement, the method comprising the steps of: extracting advertisement desired information included in the information; extracting user taste information included in the advertisement; and determining an advertisement to be attached to the information based on the extracted advertisement desired information and the extracted user taste information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, each item of the advertisement desired information indicating the type of advertisement which the one providing information wishes to be attached to the information, is compared with each item of the user taste information indicating the characteristics of the user by whom the one providing an advertisement wants the advertisement to be viewed, so that an advertisement with the most corresponding items can be selected. Thus, an appropriate advertisement in accordance with the content of the information can be attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides an advertisement-attached information providing method, wherein in the case where user information about a user who purchases the information is provided, the content of each item of the advertisement desired information corresponding to each item of the provided user information is temporarily changed to the content of the user information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, when the user information such as, e.g., age and place of residence is provided, the user information is given priority over the advertisement desired information indicating the type of advertisement which the one providing the information wishes to be attached to the information. Accordingly; the advertiser can provide an advertisement matching the characteristics of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a program for providing information attached with an advertisement, comprising the steps of: extracting advertisement desired information included in the information; extracting user taste information included in the advertisement; and determining an advertisement to be attached to the information based on the extracted advertisement desired information and the extracted user taste information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a computer-readable recording medium recorded with a program for providing information attached with an advertisement, the program being designed to execute the steps of extracting advertisement desired information included in the information; extracting user taste information included in the advertisement; determining an advertisement to be attached to the information based on the extracted advertisement desired information and the extracted user taste information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to these inventions, each item of the advertisement desired information indicating the type of advertisement which the one providing information wishes to be attached to the information is compared with each item of the user taste information indicating the characteristics of the user by whom the advertisement provider wishes the advertisement to be viewed, so that the advertisement with the most corresponding items can be selected. Thus, an appropriate advertisement in accordance with the content of the information can be attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides an advertisement-attached information providing method for providing information attached with an advertisement, comprising the steps of: extracting an advertisement to be attached to the information; extracting an advertisement unit price corresponding to the extracted advertisement; calculating a fee for the advertisement-attached information by subtracting the advertisement unit price from the price of the information; and the advertisement-attached information is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to these inventions, since the advertisement data to be attached to the information comprises the advertisement unit price data, the advertiser can set an advertisement fee commensurate with the quantity of the advertisement attached to the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a program for providing information attached with an advertisement, the program being designed to execute the steps of: extracting an advertisement to be attached to information; extracting an advertisement unit price corresponding to the extracted advertisement; calculating a fee for the advertisement-attached information by subtracting the advertisement unit price from the price of the information; and providing the advertisement-attached information. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the advertisement additional information <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> comprises an advertisement unit price <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, an advertisement size <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> indicating the data size of the advertisement, user taste information <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> indicating the taste of the user targeted by the advertisement, an advertisement period <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> indicating the effective period of the advertisement, an advertisement fee upper-limit <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> indicating the upper limit of the advertisement fee to be paid by the advertiser, and an accumulated advertisement fee <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> indicating the total accumulated amount of the advertisement unit price <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is as it is incurred each time the advertisement main body <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is selected and attached to the information main body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The advertisement unit price <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> incurred every time the advertisement main body <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> corresponding to the advertisement additional information <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is selected according to a selection method which will be described later and added to the information main body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The advertisement unit price <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> corresponds to the advertisement fee to be paid by the advertiser. The advertisement unit price <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> also corresponds to the amount of discount in the fee to be paid by the user as he purchases the information. When the amount of the accumulated advertisement fee <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> exceeds the advertisement fee upper-limit <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, the advertisement is not attached thereafter. The advertisement period <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> indicates the period in which the information main body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may be sold as attached with the advertisement main body <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. After this period, the attachment of the advertisement main body <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is halted. The user taste information <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> includes target age, sex, hobbies, location and other data, and sets a content corresponding to the user to which the advertiser wishes to provide the advertisement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> stores the provided advertisement data <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> in the advertisement information storage unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> under the control of the central processing unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. As a plurality of advertisers provide the advertisement data <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> in a repeated manner, a plurality of pieces of advertisement data <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> are stored in the advertisement information storage unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Hereafter, the process of the user purchasing advertisement-attached information from the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Initially, the user views the content of the information stored in the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by using the information purchasing apparatus <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and selects the information he wishes to purchase. Next, the user transmits his personal information and stores it in the user information storage unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an example of the data structure of the user&apos;s personal information. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the user information <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> comprises data such as age, sex, hobbies, and area of residence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> then selects the advertisement to be attached to the selected information and calculates the fee after a discount in the case of attaching an advertisement. Hereafter, this process will be described by referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a flowchart of the process starting from the selection of the advertisement to be attached to the user-selected information to the provision of the information. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, first the most appropriate advertisement corresponding to the selected information is extracted based on the advertisement desired information <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, user taste information <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, and user information <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>). The extraction method will be described in detail later by referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Next, the advertisement unit price <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the extracted advertisement is extracted from the advertisement additional information <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, the fee for the advertisement to be attached to the information (advertisement unit price <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>) is subtracted from the price of the selected information (information price <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>) to calculate a fee which is the fee for the advertisement-attached information (S<highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>). Then, the advertisement-attached information is provided to the user via the communication line <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a flowchart of the detailed process of the selection of the advertisement to be attached to the information selected by the user and the calculation of the fee in the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Initially, the additional information <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> corresponding to the selected information is extracted from the information storage unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the number of pieces of the advertisement information <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> set in the extracted additional information <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is substituted in N (S<highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>), and the value of a variable I is set at 0 (S<highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>). The variable I is used in a counter when an N number of pieces of advertisement information are attached to the information main body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, one of the remaining pieces of advertisement information <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> from the N number of items of advertisement information <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> that have not been selected yet is selected (S<highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Next, it is determined whether or not there is an input in any of the items of the user information <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. If there is an input item, the content of a corresponding item in the advertisement desired information <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is temporarily changed to the content of the user information <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> (to be hereafter referred to as temporary advertisement desired information) (S<highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>). Namely, when there is personal information provided by the user, that information is adopted in preference to the advertisement desired information <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Thus, when deciding on the content of the advertisement to be attached to the information, it becomes possible to take into consideration not only the desired information from the advertiser and the information provider, but also the user&apos;s personal information. In the case where the user provided not all but only some of the items in the user information <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> for privacy protection reasons, the temporary change may be made by using only the available items. If the user did not provide any user information <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> for privacy protection reasons, the temporary advertisement desired information is not created, and the decision is made based on the result of comparison between the advertisement desired information <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and the user taste information <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. The decision method is such, for example, that each item of the advertisement desired information <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and each item of the user taste information <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> are compared with each other, and an advertisement with the most corresponding items is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Next, the advertisement size <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> of each advertisement additional information <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> stored in the advertisement information storage unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is compared with the region size <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> of the selected information data <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Based on the result of the comparison, the advertisement data <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is selected (S<highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>). The method of comparison is such, for example, that an advertisement size smaller than the region size is selected. Further, each item of the user taste information <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of each selected advertisement additional information <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is compared with each item of the above-mentioned temporary advertisement desired information. Based on the result of this comparison, a further optimal advertisement data <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is selected from the advertisement data <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> that was selected in S<highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. The method of comparison is such, for example, that each item of the user taste information <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is compared with each item of the temporary advertisement desired information, and the advertisement data with the most corresponding items is selected. It should be noted, however, that the advertisement data whose accumulated advertisement fee <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> exceeds the advertisement fee upper-limit <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is excluded from the selection so as to prevent the advertisement from being attached any more. Similarly, the advertisement data whose time or date of selection exceeds the advertisement period <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is also excluded from the selection so as to prevent the advertisement from being attached any more. The advertisement period is useful when an advertisement is to be only effective during a limited period of time and its period of distribution should be limited. Such an advertisement may read, for example, &ldquo;Product A is discounted by 50% at a shop XXX only during May 1-31, 2000.&rdquo; When a plurality of pieces of advertisement data <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> are selected, one of the selected pieces of advertisement additional information <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> that has the highest advertisement unit price <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Then, the selected advertisement additional information <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is stored temporarily as advertisement additional information Ki (S<highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>), and the advertisement main body <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> corresponding to the advertisement additional information <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is extracted. The extracted advertisement main body <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is embedded in an advertisement region <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> within the information main body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the advertisement region ID <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> existing in the advertisement information <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> selected in S<highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Then, the variable I is incremented by one (S<highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>), and the variable I is compared with the number N of advertisement information pieces (S<highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>). If I is smaller than N, the process returns to S<highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, and if I is larger than N, the process goes on to S<highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, a charge processing is performed. First, the advertisement unit fee <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> corresponding to each advertisement additional information <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> selected in S<highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is added to a corresponding accumulated advertisement fee <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the advertisement unit price <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> present in each advertisement additional information Ki stored in S<highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> is taken as Yi, and Yi is added to the accumulated advertisement fee <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> in Ki. Next, the advertisement unit price <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of each advertisement information selected in S<highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is summed up to calculate a total advertisement fee Ya, such that the total advertisement fee Ya&equals;&Sgr;Yi(i&equals;0 to N). Next, if the total advertisement fee Ya exceeds the information price <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> described in the additional information <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> corresponding to the selected information, that is if X&lt;Ya where X is the information price, the amount by which the total advertisement fee exceeds the information fee is returned to the advertisement fee. Namely, with respect to each advertisement i, an amount calculated by (Ya&minus;X)Yi/Ya is subtracted from the accumulated advertisement fee <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> in each advertisement-attached information Ki. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>, the information fee to be ultimately paid by the user is calculated and charged to the user. Specifically, if X&lt;Ya in S<highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, the information fee is free, and in other cases, the user is notified of X&minus;Ya as the information fee via the communication line <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and information purchase apparatus <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and the fee is collected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, after acknowledging the payment of the information fee by the user as notified in S<highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>, the information main body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> embedded with the advertisement is provided to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>, a counter-value for the information, i.e., the information price X, is paid via the communication line <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the corresponding information provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Hardware in the present embodiment including the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the advertisement providing apparatus <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and the information purchase apparatus <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is configured from a general-purpose computer, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, numeral <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> designates a computer main unit comprising a CPU (central processing unit) <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>, a memory <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, a hard disc <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>, an input apparatus <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, a display apparatus <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight>, a media drive <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, and a communications interface <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight> which are all connected via a bus line <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> CPU <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>, which is comprised of a microprocessor, for example, controls the computer as a whole by executing a program in the memory <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> or on the hard disc <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>. The memory <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> is comprised of a RAM (random access memory) and a ROM (read-only memory) and used for the storage of the program or various data. The hard disc <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> is used for the storage of the information to be provided, advertisements to be attached to the information, personal information of the users, etc., in the case of the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The input apparatus <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, which is an interface for operating the present apparatus, is comprised, e.g., of a keyboard, a mouse, a touch panel, button or the like. The display apparatus <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight> is a device for displaying various information for, e.g., acknowledging purposes. The display apparatus may be comprised of a CRT (cathode-ray tube) or an LCD (liquid crystal display), for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The media drive <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> is used for reading and writing information on a recording medium <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and comprised of an FD (floppy disc), MO (magneto-optical disc), MD (mini disc), or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The communications interface <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight> is used for interfacing with a communications line <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> such as the Internet, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> While in the present embodiment, the processes illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> have been described to be performed by the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the processes may be partly or entirely recorded on a computer-readable recording medium such as a floppy disc or CD-ROM, or loaded onto the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via the communications line, before they are executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Further, in the present embodiment, it is possible to simplify the process of transmitting the user information every time the user purchases the information. For example, the user information <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is transmitted when the user utilizes the service for the first time, and the transmitted user information <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is registered in the user information storage unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As the user information is registered, the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> issues a user ID number which is then provided to the user. When the user comes to input the user information for the second time and later, he only needs to input his ID number to the information purchasing apparatus <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can associate the user ID number with user information that is already registered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the maintenance of the advertisement information storage unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be performed as follows. Namely, the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> extracts, at predetermined intervals, those pieces of advertisement information in the advertisement information storage unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> whose advertisement periods have already been passed by the current time or date or in which the difference between the advertisement fee upper-limit <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and the accumulated advertisement fee <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is smaller than the advertisement unit fee <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Then, the individual advertisers who provided those pieces of extracted advertisement information are notified, via the communications line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and advertisement providing apparatus <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, of the fact that further attachment of advertisements is not possible, while paying back the amount of money equivalent to the upper-limit advertisement fee minus the accumulated advertisement fee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, when the advertiser wishes to know the current accumulated advertisement fee <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>, he can request, via the communications line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the advertisement providing apparatus <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the advertisement-attached information providing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to notify him of that information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> While the present embodiment is arranged such that the user always transmits the user information, and the type of the advertisement is determined based on that information, it is possible to determine the advertisement based on the advertisement desired information <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and user taste information <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> without the transmission of the user information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present embodiment, it is possible to determine the advertisement attached to the information based on at least two pieces of information selected from the group consisting of the advertisement desired information indicating the type of advertisement which the information provider wishes to be attached to the information, the user taste information indicating the characteristics of the users by whom the advertisement provider wishes the advertisement to be viewed, and the user information of the user who purchase the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since a unit price is provided for the advertisement to be attached to the information in the present invention, it is possible to properly control the fee to be paid by the user for each piece of provided information and the advertisement fee to be paid by the advertiser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Since an upper limit in the advertisement fee is provided, the advertiser can provide a quantity of advertising to the user which is commensurate with the advertisement fee he paid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Since an association can be established between the advertisement provided by the advertiser and the user who views the advertisement, the advertiser can provide the advertisement to certain users. </paragraph>
