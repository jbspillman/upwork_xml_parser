<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a technique of identifying a printer recording material receptacle in a printing apparatus, and more particularly to a technique of identifying whether a printer recording material receptacle has been installed when replacing a printer recording material receptacle. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In color printers comprising ink cartridges (printer recording material receptacles) of a multiplicity of colors, there have been proposed techniques to prevent erroneous installation of ink cartridges, i.e. installation of an ink cartridge of a different ink color than the one to be replaced, during ink cartridge replacement. For example, there is known the technique of varying the contour shape of ink cartridges for each ink color to physically prevent installation of an incorrect ink cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Where ink cartridges of identical contour shape are used, there is also known the technique of providing on the printer a cover having an opening through which only a single ink cartridge can be attached/detached, and moving the ink cartridge to be replaced to the opening to permit attachment/detachment of only the ink cartridge to be replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, where ink cartridges of different contour shape for each color are used, when ink cartridges are reused, ink cartridges can only be reused on a per-ink color basis, so there was the problem of bad recycling efficiency. Also, even if erroneous installation of ink cartridges could be prevented, it was not possible to prevent the problem of mistakenly uninstalling an ink cartridge not requiring replacement. Also, it was necessary to fabricate a different ink cartridge-use mold on a per-ink color basis, so there was the problem of high cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With the technique of moving ink cartridges to a predetermined replacement location, even if mistaken uninstallation of an ink cartridge not intended to be replaced could be prevented, it could not be detected whether an installed ink cartridge was the correct ink cartridge, so there was the problem of inability to prevent erroneous installation. </paragraph>

When accessing memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> requests the reset signal generating circuit to generate a reset signal. Thus, a reset signal will be generated also in the event of a power outage, or if the power plug is unplugged. CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> controls the backup power circuit to supply power for a predetermined time interval (0.3 s, for example) even if the power supply should be interrupted. As a result, even if the power should be interrupted while data is being written due to a power outage or the power plug being unplugged, during the aforementioned time interval it will be possible to complete writing of data assigned priority of writing. The backup power circuit may consist of a capacitor, for example. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The internal arrangement of memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the internal circuit arrangement of memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As the internal arrangement of each individual memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is similar, apart from the identifying information (identifying data) and unique data stored therein, the following description will focus on the internal arrangement of memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as representative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, address counter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, ID comparator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, operation code decoder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, I/O controller <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and factory setting unit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has a memory area of predetermined capacity, for example, 256 bits. Identifying data is stored in the head 3 bits of the memory area, and the memory area of the fourth bit from the head is a null area. As noted above, the head 3 bits of a data sequence sent from CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> store identifying data, and the fourth bit from the head stores a write/read command. Therefore, data cannot be written unless it is to the memory area of the fifth and subsequent bits from the head, and by providing this arrangement to the memory area of memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the head four bits constitute a read-only memory area. Memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has an area starting at the fifth bit from the head where information to be given priority of writing, for example, information relating to ink consumption or remaining ink, is written. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Address counter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is a circuit that increments the counter value in sync with a clock signal SCK supplied via factory setting unit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and is connected to memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Counter values and memory locations (addresses) of memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are associated, and a write location or read location in memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be indicated by a counter value in address counter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Address counter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is also connected with reset signal terminal RT, and when a reset signal RST is input the counter value is reset to the initial value. Here, the initial value may be any value provided it is associated with the head location of memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>; typically 0 is used as the initial value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> ID comparator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is connected to clock signal terminal CT, data signal terminal DT and reset signal terminal RT, and determines whether identifying data included in a data sequence input via data signal terminal DT and identifying data stored in memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> match. To describe in more detail, ID comparator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> acquires 3 bits of data, i.e. identifying data, after a reset signal RST has been input. ID comparator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> has a 3-bit register (not shown) that stores identifying data included in the data sequence and a 3-bit register (not shown) that stores identifying data acquired from memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> via I/O controller <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and determines whether identifying data matches depending on whether the values in the two registers match. ID comparator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, in the case that the two identifying data match, transmits an access enable signal EN to operation code decoder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. ID comparator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> clears the values in the registers when a reset signal RST is input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Operation code decoder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is connected to I/O controller <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, clock signal terminal CT, and data signal terminal DT, and acquires the data of the fourth bit after input of a reset signal RST, that is, a write/read command. Operation code decoder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, when an access enable signal EN is input, analyzes the acquired write/read command and transmits a write operation request or read operation request to I/O controller <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Operation code decoder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is also connected to factory setting unit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and in test mode upon completing analysis of a write/read command transmits an analysis completed notification to factory setting unit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> I/O controller <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is connected to data signal terminal DT and memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and in accordance with a request from operation code decoder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> performs switching control of data transfer direction vis-&agrave;-vis memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and data transfer direction vis-&agrave;-vis data signal terminal DT (the signal line connected to data signal terminal DT). I/O controller <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is also connected to reset terminal RT, and receives reset signals RST. I/O controller <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> has a first buffer memory (not shown) that temporarily stores data read from memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and data to be written to memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and a second buffer memory (not shown) that temporarily stores data from data bus DB and data going to data bus DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> I/O controller <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is initialized by input of a reset signal RST, and during initialization sets the data transfer direction vis-&agrave;-vis memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to the read direction, and brings the signal line connected to data signal terminal DT to high impedance, disabling data transfer vis-&agrave;-vis data signal terminal DT. The state at the time of initialization is maintained until a write operation request or read operation request is input from operation code decoder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, data of the head 4 bits of a data sequence input via data signal terminal DT after reset signal input is not written in memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, whereas data stored in the head 4 bits of memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (of which the 4th bit is null data) is transmitted to ID comparator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. As a result, the head 4 bits of memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are read-only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Factory setting unit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is connected to a test signal terminal TT, clock signal terminal CT, and data signal terminal DT, and when a test signal is input executes a test mode process. Factory setting unit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in the absence of input of a test signal transfers the received clock signal SCK as-is to the address counter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and in the presence of a test signal does not transfer the clock signal SCK to the address counter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> until receiving an analysis completion notification from operation code decoder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Factory setting unit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> transmits test mode commands to operation code decoder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Test signal terminal TT is connected to pull-down resistance, and is a normally non-active terminal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Operation of an ink cartridge identifying device pertaining to Embodiment 1 is described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>-<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing a typical processing routine executed by a personal computer PC when accessing memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a timing chart showing temporal relationships of the reset signal RST, clock signal SCK, data signal CDA, and address counter value when reading data. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a timing chart showing temporal relationships of the reset signal RST, clock signal SCK, data signal CDA, and address counter value when writing data. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing a processing routine of an ink cartridge identifying process performed during initial ink cartridge installation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>-<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> are explanatory diagrams showing movement of ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> during ink cartridge replacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC waits until the input value CO of cartridge out signal line COL goes to 0 (Step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>: No). That is, if all of the ink cartridges are properly seated in the ink cartridge holder, since the cartridge out detection line CDL is cascade connected and grounded via the cartridge out detection terminals COT, the input value CO of cartridge out signal line COL will indicate ground voltage (about 0 V, for example). If, on the other hand, even a single ink cartridge is not properly seated in the ink cartridge holder, the cartridge out detection line CDL is not cascade connected and therefore not grounded, so a value corresponding to the circuit voltage of the control circuit appears on the cartridge out signal line COL. In this embodiment, the effects of noise etc. are eliminated through binarization on the basis of a predetermined threshold value. Thus, the input value of the cartridge out signal line COL will assume the value 0 or 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Once the input value CO of cartridge out signal line COL goes to 0 (Step S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>: Yes), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> personal computer PC supplies power supply voltage to the positive power terminals VDDM of memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> via power supply line VDL (VDD&equals;1), and causes the reset signal generating circuit to generate a reset signal (set RST&equals;0) which is transmitted to the reset bus RB via the reset signal line RL (Step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). In other words, power supply voltage is not supplied to memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> unless the ink cartridges are properly seated in the ink cartridge holder. It should be noted that since the reset signal RST is active low, the expression &ldquo;generate, input a reset signal RST&rdquo; herein refers to a reset low signal unless indicated otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, personal computer PC then sets the reset signal generating circuit to RST&equals;1 and sets the reset signal RST to High (Step S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). Personal computer PC then issues identifying data (ID data) for the ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) to which access is desired (Step S<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>). The issued ID data is transmitted to data bus DB over data signal line DL, in sync with the rising edge of the clock signal SCK, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC issues either a read command (Read) or a write command (Write) to the first data signal line DL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>). The issued command is transmitted to the data bus DB via data signal line DL. CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, in the case that the issued command is a Write command, slows down the clock signal speed, and in the case that the issued command is a Read command, maintains the clock signal speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC issues clock signal pulses corresponding in number to the address (location) of memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> at which reading or writing is desired (Step S<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>). That is, since memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is a sequential access type of memory device, it is necessary to issue clock signal pulses corresponding in number to the address at which reading or writing is desired, and to increment the count value in the address counter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> until the count value corresponds to the selected address. Finally, personal computer PC causes the reset signal generating circuit to generate a reset low signal (set RST&equals;0) that is transmitted to the reset bus RB via reset signal line RL, terminating access of memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Since access is terminated by transmitting a reset signal RST (reset low signal) in this way, and since a reset signal RST is transmitted also in the event of a power interruption during data writing, the data write operation is able to terminate normally, at least for data that has finished writing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Next, an ink cartridge identifying process performed at initial installation of ink cartridges is described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>-<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. When the power is turned on, personal computer PC receives an ink exchange request (Step S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>). An ink exchange request is generated automatically in the case that the power is turned on with ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> not installed, or in the case that initial loading of an ink cartridge CA has been indicated via the user interface of a driver application shown on a display connected to personal computer PC. It is also generated in the case that an ink cartridge exchange switch SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on control panel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has been operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC moves the n-th ink cartridge to the exchange location via control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). Personal computer PC is assumed to use &ldquo;1&rdquo; as the initial value of n, and in the following explanation is explained as n&equals;1. Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, first, the first ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is moved to a location corresponding to exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Here, the location at which the exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed and the movement distance of each ink cartridge CA are each set to the travel distance of carriage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from the home position. Therefore, when an ink cartridge CA is moved to a predetermined location, carriage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> should be moved a distance set with reference to each ink cartridge CA. The movement distance of carriage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be measured (detected) accurately using a linear encoder or the like. As for ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, CA<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as well, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, they are moved serially to the location corresponding to exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. To facilitate the explanation, only the cases of ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, CA<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are shown., </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC waits until ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is installed on the basis of cartridge out signal COO as described earlier (Step S<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>: No). When ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is installed (Step S<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>: Yes), identifying data corresponding to identifying data held by memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transmitted over data bus DB (Step S<highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC determines whether or not there is a response to the transmitted identifying data (Step S<highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>). That is, when the ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be installed is installed, the memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> holding the identifying data corresponding to the transmitted identifying data responds, and if an incorrect ink cartridge CA has been installed, none of the memory devices can respond to identifying data corresponding to memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Personal computer PC, in the event that there is no response (Step S<highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>: No), notifies to the effect that an incorrect ink cartridge CA has been installed (Step S<highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>), returns to Step S<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and again detects installation of the correct ink cartridge CA. Regarding notification of installation of an incorrect ink cartridge CA, a lamp LM arranged on control panel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be flashed, for example. Alternatively, a warning may be displayed via the driver application user interface screen shown on a display of a personal computer connected via control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC, in the event that there is a response (Step S<highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>: Yes), determines whether installation of all ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has been completed, that is, whether n&equals;m (Step S<highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>). As will be understood from the preceding explanation, in this embodiment m&equals;4. In the case that personal computer PC determines that that n does not equal m, (Step S<highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>: No), it increments n (n&equals;n&plus;1) (Step S<highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>). That is, it identifies (monitors) whether installation of the next ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has been done correctly. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are moved serially to a location corresponding to exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In the case that personal computer PC determines that n&equals;m (Step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>: Yes), it determines that installation of all ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has been completed correctly, and terminates the processing routine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the ink cartridge identifying device pertaining to Embodiment 1, at the time of installation of ink cartridges CA, identifying data stored in the memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of each ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is utilized allowing it to be detected whether the correct ink cartridge CA has been installed. Using the result of detection, it is possible to notify to the effect that an incorrect ink cartridge CA has been installed, and to prompt installation of the correct ink cartridge CA. Further, in the event that an incorrect ink cartridge CA has been installed, the ink cartridge CA identifying process is continued until the correct ink cartridge CA is installed, so the correspondence relationships of ink eject heads PN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PN<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be properly maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, incorrect installation of ink cartridges CA can be detected without imparting unique features to contour shapes of ink cartridges, so it is possible to use ink cartridges CA having the same shape, and the cost needed in the case of changing to a different contour for each contained ink type can be reduced. Also, the ink cartridge identifying device of this embodiment is provided with an exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and can limit the installation location of ink cartridges CA, so the correct ink cartridge Ca can be installed at the correct location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> D. Ink Cartridge Identifying Process Pertaining to Embodiment 2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> An identifying process of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 2 is described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing a processing routine performed during an ink cartridge identifying process pertaining to Embodiment 2. The ink cartridge identifying process pertaining to Embodiment 2 can be executed on the identifying device of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> This processing routine is executed after completing initial installation ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, when an ink cartridge CA is empty, etc. Accordingly, personal computer PC waits until an ink exchange request is generated (Step S<highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>: No). An ink exchange request is issued (generated), for example, in the case of the control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of color printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> monitoring the remaining ink amount in each ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the remaining ink amount in each ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> falls below a predetermined value. Or, it is issued in the case the exchange of a desired ink cartridge is indicated deliberately by the user via the user interface of a driver application displayed on the display connected to personal computer PC. Or, it is generated by the user operating ink cartridge exchange switch SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC, in the event of determining that an ink exchange request has been generated (Step S<highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>: Yes) identifies the ink cartridge CA whose exchange was requested (Step S<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). In the case that the ink exchange request was generated by control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the ink cartridge CA targeted for exchange is already known (has been identified) to personal computer PC. In the event that the ink exchange request was generated deliberately by the user via the user interface of a driver application, it is identified by acquiring indication information input via the user interface. In the following explanation, for convenience in explanation, it is assumed that an exchange request of ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC moves the ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose exchange was requested to exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>). It waits for installation of a new ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>: No). That is, it waits until detecting CO&equals;0 after detecting CO&equals;1. When personal computer PC detects that CO&equals;0 (Step S<highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>: Yes) it transmits over data bus DB identifying data corresponding to the previously identified ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In the event that personal computer PC detects a response from memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided to ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>: Yes), it determines that a new ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been correctly installed, and terminates this processing routine. On the other hand, the event that personal computer PC did not detect a response from memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided to ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>: No), it determines that a new ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has not been correctly installed, and notifies to the effect that an incorrect ink cartridge CA was installed (Step S<highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>), and again checks installation of the correct ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>-Step S<highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>). Notification of an incorrect ink cartridge CA is performed on the basis of the mode described in Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the identifying device of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 2, during exchange of ink cartridges CA, identifying data stored in the memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of each ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is utilized allowing it to be detected whether the correct ink cartridge CA has been installed. Using the result of detection, it is possible to notify to the effect that an incorrect ink cartridge CA has been installed, and to prompt installation of the correct ink cartridge CA. Further, in the event that an incorrect ink cartridge CA has been installed, the ink cartridge CA identifying process is continued until the correct ink cartridge CA is installed, and the aspiration process of ink in ink cartridge CA is not performed, so that soiling of ink eject heads PN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PN<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> due to aspiration of the incorrect ink can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, incorrect installation of ink cartridges CA can be detected without imparting unique features to contour shapes of ink cartridges, so it is possible to use ink cartridges CA having the same shape, there is no need to change to a different contour for each contained ink type, and the cost associated with changing contours can be reduced. Also, the ink cartridge identifying device of this embodiment is provided with an exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and can restrict the installation location of ink cartridges CA as well as restricting the installation location of ink cartridges CA, so the ink cartridge CA to be exchanged can be corrected detached/attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> E. Ink Cartridge Identifying Process Pertaining to Embodiment 3 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> An identifying process of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 3 is described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing a processing routine performed during an ink cartridge identifying process pertaining to Embodiment 3. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing a processing routine performed during an ink cartridge identifying process in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. Here, the identifying process of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 3 is suitable for a printer not furnished with an exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and permitting the user to arbitrarily detach/attach ink cartridges CA. The identifying process of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 3, while not requiring an exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and movement of ink cartridges CA whose exchange is targeted, is implementable with respect to the identifying device of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 1, so in the following explanation symbols that are the same as symbols used in the identifying device of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 1 are used. However, moving of ink cartridges CA whose exchange is targeted is not performed, and it is assumed that ink cartridges CA are arbitrarily detachable/attachable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The identifying process of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 3 is executed after completing initial installation ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, when an ink cartridge CA is empty, etc. Accordingly, personal computer PC waits until an ink exchange request is generated (Step S<highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>: No). An ink exchange request is generated, for example, by the control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which monitors the remaining ink amount in each ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, in the case that the remaining ink amount in each ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> falls below a predetermined value, or in the case the exchange of a desired ink cartridge CA is indicated deliberately by the user via the user interface of a driver application displayed on the display connected to personal computer PC. Or, it is generated by operation of an ink cartridge exchange switch SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided on color printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC, in the event of determining that an ink exchange request has been generated (Step S<highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>: Yes) performs an ink cartridge identifying process (Step S<highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). In this embodiment, since the user can detach/attach arbitrary ink cartridges CA, there is required an ink cartridge identifying process that identifies whether an uninstalled ink cartridge CA is the same as the ink cartridge CA whose exchange was requested. This ink cartridge identifying process is described in detail referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC first identifies the ink cartridge CA whose exchange was requested (Step S<highlight><bold>4100</bold></highlight>). In the case that the ink exchange request was generated by control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the personal computer PC has already identified the ink cartridge CA targeted for exchange. In the event that the ink exchange request was generated deliberately by the user, the personal computer PC identifies the ink cartridge CA to be exchanged by acquiring indication information of the ink cartridge CA indicated by the user on the user interface. In the following explanation, for convenience in explanation, it is assumed that an exchange request of ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC waits until the input value CO of cartridge out signal COO becomes 1, that is, until ink cartridge CA is uninstalled (Step S<highlight><bold>4110</bold></highlight>: No). In this case, personal computer PC cannot identify which ink cartridge CA has been uninstalled, and waits for uninstallation of any ink cartridge CA. When personal computer PC detects that the input value CO of cartridge out signal COO equals 1 (Step S<highlight><bold>4110</bold></highlight>: Yes), it transmits over data bus DB identifying data corresponding to the previously identified ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>4120</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC determines whether there is a response to identifying data transmitted over the data bus DB (Step S<highlight><bold>4130</bold></highlight>). As mentioned earlier, the memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> do not respond as long as they do not receive identifying data matching the identifying data held by themselves, and so by transmitting identifying data over the data bus DB it can be detected whether the ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose exchange was requested has been correctly uninstalled. In the event that personal computer PC does not detect a response from memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided to ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>4130</bold></highlight>: No), it determines that ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose exchange was requested has been correctly uninstalled, and returns to the processing routine of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. That is, by means of the aforementioned process, it is identified that the ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose exchange was requested and the uninstalled ink cartridge CA are the same type of ink cartridge. Then, in the processing routine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, it is determined whether the installed ink cartridge CA and ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are the same type of ink cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the event that personal computer PC does detect a response from memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided to ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>4130</bold></highlight>: Yes), it serially transmits over data bus DB identifying data corresponding to identifying data held by all of the memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>4140</bold></highlight>). In this case, it is because an ink cartridge CA other than ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been uninstalled, and it is necessary to identify which ink cartridge CA has been uninstalled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC, of the identifying data serially transmitted over data bus DB, identifies the ink cartridge CA equipped with the memory device corresponding to the identifying data to which there was no response, and temporarily stores it in RAM, not shown, as information of the actually uninstalled ink cartridge CA (Step S<highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight>). Personal computer PC notifies to the effect that an incorrect ink cartridge CA has been uninstalled (Step S<highlight><bold>4160</bold></highlight>), and returns to the processing routine of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. By means of the above process, the ink cartridge CA actually uninstalled instead of the ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose exchange was requested can be identified. By performing this ink cartridge identifying process, it can be determined whether an uninstalled ink cartridge CA and an installed ink cartridge CA are the same type of ink cartridge. This is because where there is a possibility that an ink cartridge CA other than the ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose exchange was requested could be uninstalled, if the ink cartridge identifying process described above is not performed, it cannot be verified whether an ink cartridge CA whose exchange was requested and an uninstalled ink cartridge CA are the same type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> to continue the explanation, personal computer PC waits until detecting installation of a new ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is, until detecting CO&equals;0 (Step S<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>: No). When personal computer PC detects that CO&equals;0 (Step S<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>: Yes) it transmits over data bus DB identifying data corresponding to the ink cartridge CA identified in the ink cartridge identifying process (Step S<highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In the event that personal computer PC detects a response from the memory device (or memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) provided to the identified ink cartridge CA (or ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), (Step S<highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>: Yes), it determines that a new ink cartridge CA has been correctly installed, and terminates this processing routine. On the other hand, the event that personal computer PC did not detect a response from the memory device provided to the identified ink cartridge CA (Step S<highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>: No), it determines that an ink cartridge CA of the same type as the previously uninstalled ink cartridge CA has not been installed, notifies to the effect that an incorrect ink cartridge CA was installed (Step S<highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>), and again checks installation of the correct ink cartridge CA (Step S<highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>-Step S<highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>). Notification of an incorrect ink cartridge CA is performed on the basis of the mode described in Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the identifying device of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 3, during exchange of ink cartridges CA, identifying data stored in the memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of each ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is utilized, allowing it to be detected whether the correct ink cartridge CA has been installed. Also, in this embodiment, it can be identified whether an uninstalled ink cartridge CA is the ink cartridge CA that should have been uninstalled, so even in cases where the printer lacks a physically restricting structure, for example, being provided with an exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, wherein the ink cartridge CA to be exchanged is moved to the exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it can be identified accurately whether an uninstalled ink cartridge CA and an installed ink cartridge CA match. The identifying process of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 3 is of course applicable to printers provided with a physically restricting structure such as an exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this case, even if an ink cartridge CA has been uninstalled without going through the normal procedure, it can be identified more reliably whether an uninstalled ink cartridge CA is the ink cartridge CA that should have been uninstalled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Using the result of detection, it is possible to notify to the effect that an incorrect ink cartridge CA has been installed, and to prompt installation of the correct ink cartridge CA, via the user interface on the display screen of the personal computer PC, or via an indicator lamp LM on color printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, in the event that an incorrect ink cartridge CA has been installed, the ink cartridge CA identifying process is continued until the correct ink cartridge CA is installed, and the aspiration process of ink in ink cartridge CA is not performed, so that soiling of ink eject heads PN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-PN<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> due to aspiration of the incorrect ink can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, incorrect installation of ink cartridges CA can be detected without imparting unique features to contour shapes of ink cartridges, so it is possible to use ink cartridges CA of the same shape, there is no need to change to a different contour for each contained ink type, and the cost associated with changing contours can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> F. Ink Cartridge Identifying Device Pertaining to Embodiment 4 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The ink cartridge identifying device pertaining to Embodiment 4 is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing interconnects of the control circuit and memory devices used in the ink cartridge identifying device pertaining to Embodiment 4. The ink cartridge identifying device pertaining to Embodiment 4, apart from some differences in interconnections of memory devices and the control circuit, basically has the same arrangement as the ink cartridge identifying device pertaining to Embodiment 1, and so the same symbols are assigned to the same constituent elements, and description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The data signal terminals DT, clock signal terminals CT and reset signal terminals RT of the memory devices <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in this embodiment are respectively connected via a data bus DB, clock bus CB and reset bus RB. Personal computer PC and data bus DB, clock bus CB, and reset bus RB are connected via a data signal line DL, clock signal line CL, and reset signal line RL. These signal lines are realized as flexible feed cable (FFC), for example. The positive power terminal VDDH of CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the positive power terminals VDDM of memory devices <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are connected via a power supply line VDL. The negative power terminals VSS of memory devices <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are connected in cascade to a negative power line VSL on carriage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. A first end of negative power line VSL is grounded, while the other end is connected via a cartridge out signal line COL to the cartridge out detection terminal COT of personal computer PC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In the ink cartridge identifying device pertaining to Embodiment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, since the negative power line VSL is used also as a cartridge out detection line, arrangement of signal lines with respect to memory devices <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> can be made easy. Also, apart from during initial installation of ink cartridges, it can be reliably identified whether the correct ink cartridge CA has been installed, without devising any other special means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> G. Ink Cartridge Identification Replacement Process Pertaining to Embodiment 5 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Next, the ink cartridge identification exchange process pertaining to Embodiment 5 is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing a processing routine performed during an ink cartridge identification exchange process pertaining to Embodiment 5. The ink cartridge identification exchange process pertaining to Embodiment 5 may be implemented on the ink cartridge identifying device pertaining to Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> This processing routine is executed after completing initial installation ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, when ink contained in an ink cartridge CA is empty, etc. Accordingly, personal computer PC waits until an ink exchange request is generated (Step S<highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>: No). An ink exchange request is issued (generated), for example, in the case that the control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of color printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> monitors the remaining ink amount in each ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the remaining ink amount in each ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> falls below a predetermined value. Alternatively, it is issued in the case the exchange of a desired ink cartridge is indicated deliberately by the user via the user interface of a driver application displayed on the display connected to personal computer PC. Or, it is generated by the user operating ink cartridge exchange switch SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC, in the event of determining that an ink exchange request has been generated (Step S<highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>: Yes) identifies the ink cartridge CA whose exchange was requested (Step S<highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>). In the case that the ink exchange request was generated by control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the ink cartridge CA targeted for exchange is already known (has been identified) to personal computer PC. In the event that the ink exchange request was generated deliberately by the user via the user interface of a driver application, it is identified by acquiring indication information input via the user interface. In the following explanation, for convenience in explanation, it is assumed that an exchange request of ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC moves the ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose exchange was requested to exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>), and waits for installation of a new ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>: No). That is, it waits until detecting CO&equals;0 after detecting CO&equals;1. When personal computer PC detects that CO&equals;0 (Step S<highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>: Yes) it transmits over data bus DB identifying data (identifier symbol) corresponding to the previously identified ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In the event that personal computer PC detects a response from memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided to ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>: Yes), it determines that a new ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been correctly installed, and terminates this processing routine. On the other hand, the event that personal computer PC did not detect a response from memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided to ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>: No), it determines whether there exists an ink cartridge CA* interchangeable with ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is, whether there is exists an identifier symbol whose use is permitted in place of identifying data corresponding to ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> This determination is a determination required to permit changing ink type, for example, in the case of installing an ink cartridge CA* containing dark yellow ink in place of ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> containing black ink, installing light magenta and light cyan instead of magenta and cyan, respectively. Permitted identifier symbols are stored in ROM (not shown) in personal computer PC or in PROM <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In the event that personal computer PC determines that a permitted identifier symbol exists (Step S<highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>: Yes), it sends the permitted identifier symbol over data bus DB (Step S<highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight>). Personal computer PC, in the event of detecting a response from the memory device provided to ink cartridge CA* installed in place of ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>: Yes), determines that a new ink cartridge CA* has been correctly installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Personal computer PC performs a cleaning process of ink eject head PN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight>), and terminates this routine. Since the ink type (ink color) contained differs between ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and ink cartridge CA*, ink drops of ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> remaining in ink eject head PN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are expelled (cleaned) to prevent ink of ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from mixing with ink of ink cartridge CA*. Cleaning is performed, for example, by means of performing forcible expulsion of ink drops typically performed prior to aspiration of ink from the new ink cartridge CA*, and then performing aspiration of the ink of the new ink cartridge CA* and forcible expulsion again, to replace ink drops in the ink eject head PN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with ink of the new ink cartridge CA*. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> If on the other hand personal computer PC did not detect a response from memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided to ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>: No), it again determines whether there exists another ink cartridge CA* interchangeable with ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>). That is, in response to cases where there exist a multiplicity of ink cartridges CA* interchangeable with ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is sequentially uses identifier symbols for candidate ink cartridges CA*. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In the event that personal computer PC determines that a permissible identifier symbol exists (Step S<highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>: Yes), it executes Step S<highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight>- Step S<highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> described previously. On the other hand, in the event that personal computer PC determines that a permissible identifier symbol does not exist (Step S<highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>: No), it determines that a new ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or ink cartridge CA* was not correctly installed, notifies to the effect that an incorrect ink cartridge CA was installed (Step S<highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight>), waits until installation of the correct ink cartridge CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, CA* is completed (Step S<highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>-Step S<highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>). Notification of an incorrect ink cartridge CA is performed on the basis of the mode described in Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the identifying device of ink cartridges pertaining to Embodiment 5, even if there exists an ink cartridge CA* interchangeable with a certain ink cartridge CA, it can be detected whether the correct ink cartridge CA has been installed. Where an ink cartridge CA is exchanged with an ink cartridge CA containing the ink type (ink color) prior to exchange, a cleaning process of ink eject head PN is performed, so mixing of ink prior to exchange with ink after exchange can be prevented. Thus, even if ink color is exchanged, the correct ink can be ejected and correct image output can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Additionally, since exchange of ink cartridges CA is permitted, when, for example, printing text, by using a multiplicity of ink cartridges CA of black ink, or when printing images, by using image printing-use light ink, printing may be accomplished by an ink cartridge arrangement suitable to the printing purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> According to Embodiment 5, additionally, various advantages obtainable by means of Embodiment 2 can be obtained analogously. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, color printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with an ink cartridge exchange-use exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that permits detachment/attachment of only one ink cartridge CA, and there is provided an arrangement whereby the ink cartridge CA to be replaced is indicated, and the ink cartridge CA to be replaced is correctly uninstalled. In contrast to this, it is acceptable to not provide an exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to use a typical opening portion that permits detachment/attachment of a multiplicity of ink cartridges CA, and to indicate the ink cartridge CA to be replaced, in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is an explanatory diagram showing the maintenance opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of a color printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a Y indicating the ink cartridge CA to be replaced. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is an explanatory diagram showing a carriage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>&prime; comprising an LED that indicates the ink cartridge CA to be replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, by driving carriage motor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and moving the ink cartridge CA to be replaced to the position of arrow Y provided to maintenance opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, indicates to the user the ink cartridge CA to be replaced. Thus, without providing a special exchange opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the ink cartridge CA to be replaced can be pointed out the use by means of arrow Y, so that exchange of the correct ink cartridge CA can be achieved. In the event that a multiplicity of ink cartridges CA are to be replaced, it can be achieved by repeating multiple times the process of moving the ink cartridge to be exchanged to the location of arrow Y. Also, an arrow Y may be provided at the ink exchange location <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, to point out at the ink exchange location the ink cartridge to be exchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, LEDs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are provided on carriage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in a number corresponding to the ink cartridges CA mounted thereon. During ink cartridge CA exchange, control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, after moving carriage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the ink exchange location <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, lights or extinguishes the LED <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> corresponding to the ink cartridge to be exchanged, to point out to the user the ink cartridge to be exchanged. Where there exists a multiplicity of ink cartridges to be exchanged, multiple LEDs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are lit simultaneously. Ink exchange location <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is a typical opening allowing a multiplicity of ink cartridges CA to be detached/attached. Accordingly, when exchanging an ink cartridge CA, the ink cartridge CA to be exchanged can be identified (pointed out) without moving the carriage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> multiple times, and without any need for the user to memorize the ink cartridge CA to be exchanged, the correct ink cartridge CA can be exchanged more easily. Also, LEDs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be provided to the opening of ink exchange location <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, rather than on carriage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Of course it is not limited to LEDs, it being possible to use various lights including incandescent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Hereinabove, there were explained on the basis of several embodiments identifying devices of printer recording material receptacles (ink cartridges) pertaining to the present invention, but the embodiments of the invention described above are intended to facilitate understanding of the invention and do not limit the invention. The invention can be modified or improved without departing from the scope and spirit thereof as set forth in the claims, and these equivalents are of course included in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In the preceding embodiments, there were described ink cartridge identifying devices that without using a chip select signal, identify desired ink cartridges CA using only identifying data stored in memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> provided to the ink cartridges CA, but the invention is applicable also in the case of selection of ink cartridges CA using a chip select signal. In this case, to identify each memory device, a chip select signal line is arranged between the control circuit and the memory devices. It is possible that the control circuit identify by means of a chip select signal the memory device to which access is desired, and prior to access transmit the chip select signal to the desired memory device. Since the chip select signal line and installation locations of the ink cartridges CA are associated, the control circuit possesses in advance location information of the ink cartridges (memory devices), and using this location information can identify whether or not correct ink cartridges have been installed at the individual ink cartridge installation locations, even when a multiplicity of ink cartridges are detached/attached all at once. It should be noted that, in this case as well, identifying data stored in each memory device would be used to determine which ink type is contained in the ink cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In the preceding embodiments, the ink cartridge CA identifying process is executed by means of a personal computer PC, but this series of processes could instated by performed by control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of color printer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this case, the ink cartridge CA identifying process can be performed by color printer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> alone. Where the ink cartridge CA identifying process is performed by color printer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> only, notification made during installation of an incorrect ink cartridge CA etc. is achieved via a lamp LM or display provided to color printer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In the preceding embodiments, the use of EEPROM as memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is described, but memory devices are not limited to EEPROM, provided that they can hold data in nonvolatile fashion, and allow rewriting of stored data. For example, ferroelectric memory, battery backup type memory, etc. is acceptable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In the preceding embodiments, identifying data is stored on the leading 3 bits of memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, but the volume of identifying data can be modified as appropriate to the number of storage devices needing to be identified. Memory array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> capacity is not limited to 256 bits, and may be modified as appropriate to the amount of data needing to be stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In the preceding embodiments, the four memory devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are described as being provided on independent ink cartridges of four colors (four), but instead the memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> pertaining to the embodiments could be implemented in ink cartridges of 2 to 3 colors, or 5 or more colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> In the preceding embodiments, the print recording material receptacle identifying device pertaining to the invention is described using ink jet printer-use ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, but it goes without saying that besides ink cartridges CA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, toner cartridges etc. could be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In the preceding embodiments, during notification of installation of an incorrect ink cartridge CA, there is given the example of the user interface of a driver application or an indicator lamp LM, but notification by sound via personal computer PC, or notification via a display provided to color printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are possible as well. Also, the body of color printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be provided with a sound synthesis circuit and a speaker, and installation of an incorrect ink cartridge CA notified by sound by color printer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> independently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In the preceding embodiments, there was described using ink cartridges CA of the same shape, but it is also effective with ink cartridges CA of different shapes. For example, when using an ink cartridge containing black ink and an integrated ink cartridge containing a multiplicity of color inks, the installation portion of a typical color ink cartridge is larger than the installation portion of the black cartridge, and in some cases has a structure that permits installation of a black cartridge. However, if a black cartridge is installed in the installation portion of a color ink cartridge, correct printing processes will no longer be able to be performed. Therefore, even if, for example, ink cartridges have different size or shape, by implementing the present invention, incorrect installation of ink cartridges can be prevented more appropriately. </paragraph>
