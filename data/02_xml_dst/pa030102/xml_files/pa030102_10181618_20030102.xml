<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An additive atomizing device and further means and a method for the atomization of a liquid additive in a gaseous pressure medium, more particularly compressed air, flowing through a pressure medium flow duct (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>).

A detecting means (<highlight><bold>17 </bold></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) detects at least one physical characteristic in the pressure medium flow duct (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) and signalizes same by way of a signalizing means (<highlight><bold>19 </bold></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) to a control means (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>).

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an additive atomizing device for the atomization of a liquid additive, and more particularly of a lubricant, in a gaseous pressure medium, more particularly compressed air, comprising at least one injection head, which has at least one additive passage duct, which has an inlet for the supply of the additive from an additive supply means and whose outlet opens into a pressure medium flow duct, through which the pressure medium flows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention furthermore relates to a fluid technology means, for instance in the form of a valve or a drive, a material preparing means, as for instance an oiler, a cartridge-like additive supply means for an additive atomizing device and furthermore a method for the, atomization of a liquid additive, and more especially a lubricant in a gaseous pressure medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a pneumatic system, which is operated by compressed air, the pneumatic elements of the system are supplied by one or more so-called compressed air oilers with lubricant. These lubricants must serve to provide for a low wear rate of the moving parts, to keep frictional forces in the elements at a low level and to protect the equipment against corrosion. Compressed air oilers normally use the venturi principle. In this case the compressed air is caused to pass through a constriction in the compressed air duct. At such constriction there is an outlet from a thin tube, which dips into a container for oil or some other additive. Owing to the pressure difference between the pressure upstream from the constriction and the pressure at the smallest cross section of the constriction the oil is drawn from the container mixed with air. Such a compressed air oiler is described in the book &ldquo;Pneumatische Steuerungen&rdquo; by Werner Depert and Kurt Stoll, 10th edition 1994, ISDN 3-8023-1549-9, pages 43 and 44. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A problem in connection with such compressed air oilers is that the compressed air oiler only starts to operate when a sufficiently large flow is present. In the case of an excessively small removal of air the flow velocity at the nozzle is nolonger sufficient to produce a sufficient vacuum and accordingly to draw oil from the container. Furthermore, the designer is bound to the oil pumping characteristic, that is to say to the oil pumping rate as dependent on the air flow rate, of the device, which cannot be changed. Oil metering adaptable to the different pneumatic elements is therefore hardly possible. A further disadvantage of such compressed air oilers is the great temperature dependence of the oiling action owing to the changes in viscosity in the oil in a manner dependent on the respective temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly one object of the invention is to distribute an additive and more especially a lubricant, in a gaseous pressure medium, more particularly compressed air with an optimum possibility of adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved in accordance with the invention because the pressure medium passage duct is provided with a detecting means for determining at least one physical characteristic, which can be passed by the detecting means by way of a signalizing means to a control means and a pressure producing device is provided in the at least one additive passage duct, it being possible for a pressure pulse to be exerted on the additive by the pressure producing device so that a drop of additive is expelled at the outlet, such pressure producing device being arranged to be controlled by way of a control connection by the control means in a manner dependent on the at least one physical characteristic as found by the detecting means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The object is furthermore to be achieved by a fluid technology means in accordance with the technical teaching of claim 15, by a material preparing unit in accordance with the technical teaching of claim 17, by a cartridge-like additive supply means in accordance with the technical teaching of claim 18 and by a method in accordance with the technical teaching of 19. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore in accordance with the invention an additive is not atomized by an entraining effect of compressed air but by injection using a pressure producing device. This pressure producing device is able to be controlled by a control means, which controls the pressure producing device in a fashion dependent on the physical characteristic, as for instance the instantaneous flow rate of the pressure medium in the pressure medium flow duct or on the concentration of the additive in the pressure medium. In this case only a small amount of technical complexity is required to obtain a constant additive concentration in the pressure medium, as is required and in a reproducible manner, or&mdash;for a short time&mdash;a greater or weaker concentration. Furthermore, by parametric synthesis of the control means or by some other, externally provided preset of control means it is possible for the shoot rate and/or the additive drop size to be set extremely accurately. When there is no flow of the pressure medium in the pressure medium flow duct during in interval in operation, accordingly no additive is injected into the pressure medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Devices designed and operating in accordance with the invention have only a small number of mechanical components liable to failure. Owing to the &ldquo;active&rdquo; injection of the additive using pressure atomization devices immediately and exactly metered out additive is supplied to the pressure medium and the additive is not just supplied, as in the prior art, by &ldquo;entrainment&rdquo;. The devices in accordance with the invention therefore respond rapidly and mean that there are no flow losses of the pressure medium or only very small ones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further convenient developments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For the pressure producing device it is possible for instance to employ piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, or memory-metallic element. Same may for example be in the form of a diaphragm or blade and subject the additive to a pressure pulse in the additive passage duct. Combinations of the above mentioned materials are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred form of the invention the pressure producing device comprises a blade selected from the above mentioned materials. Such a blade is then for example designed in the form of a flexural transducer, which pumps the additive toward the outlet. The flexural transducer may be so designed that it closes the outlet in the neutral position. The flexural transducer is biassed accordingly or is moved into the a position closing the outlet by an electrical neutral voltage, a magnetic field or a constant temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The pressure producing device may however also operate in accordance with an evaporation principle, in the case of which either a vapor bubble is formed in the additive or in a working liquid, as for instance water, by a heating element subject to a pulse. The vapor bubble then thrusts the additive toward the outlet. To the extent that a working liquid is utilized, same is separated by a diaphragm from the additive in the additive passage duct. It is then not necessary to take into the chemical and physical quality of the additive as regards the formation of vapor bubbles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An other preferred feature is such that the additive is so conditioned by heating&mdash;or cooling&mdash;that it possesses an optimum consistency in the additive passage ducts or in the case of injection into the pressure medium as well. It is convenient for the additive then to be heated at the respective additive passage duct so that the pressure producing device develops an optimum action. For sensing and then controlling the temperature it is possible in addition for a sensor to be arranged in the respective additive passage duct. It is however possible also for the entire additive atomizing device as a whole to be heated or cooled. The additive atomizing device is then preferably insulated from the surroundings by an insulating casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The additive is preferably supplied from cartridge-like, replaceable containers. In this case several such containers may be connected with a common supply line. It is however also possible for such a container to have an injection head, which together with the container is mounted on the respective additive atomizing device. Thus it is possible for the injection head as well, which is subject to a certain amount of corrosion or wear by the additive or may be at least partly blocked by the additive, to be replaced together with the container in an extremely simple fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In order to move the additive in the additive passage duct the additive supply device is, in accordance with preferred form of the invention, supplied with the pressure medium from the pressure medium flow duct at the inlet. It is however also possible to feed the additive into the additive passage duct simply by the pressure of the surroundings, acting on the additive supply means, from the supply means. Moreover, the additive passage duct can also be so designed, at least in part thereof, as a capillary so that owing to the capillary action additive is drawn from the additive supply means into the additive passage duct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Since the additive atomizing device may be made extremely compact, it is also possible to incorporate it directly in a fluid technology means, for example in the form of a valve or a drive. It may however also be incorporated in a material preparing unit, as for instance in an oiler for a pneumatic system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> More particularly in cases in which the control means only comprises a few components, as for instance a small microcontroller or a few analog electrical regulator components, the control means may directly integrated in the additive atomizing device or in a component group comprising the additive atomizing device. It is for instance possible as well, however, for the control means to be formed centrally, for instance in the form of a microprocessor control system, which controls several additive atomizing devices. It is also possible for a small microprocessor, controlling same, to be provided for each additive atomizing device, such microprocessor being under the control of a higher order control, for instance by way of a field bus. Using this high order control it is then for example possible to accurately set, for example, the additive concentration in the pressure medium and to check any additive concentration already present, for example using a display.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an additive atomizing device having a pressure medium flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is delimited by a wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The pressure medium flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> carries gaseous pressure medium, more particularly compressed air, flowing in the direction of the arrow <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The pressure medium flow duct is for example a component of a servicing device for pneumatic systems, as for instance an oiler, or is part of a fluid technology means, as for example in the form of a valve or a drive. The pressure medium then flows in the direction <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the arrow to one or more such valves or drives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The pressure medium flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> possesses a constriction <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is formed by a baffle-like bay <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which is located in the wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Owing to the constriction <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> there is a pressure gradient in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is measured by a detecting means in the form of pressure sensors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The sensors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are respectively joined by a connection <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The connections <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and, respectively, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are signalizing means and may for example be in the form of line, radio link or infrared connections. The control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is for example a microprocessor or an analog regulating means. On the basis of the pressure difference, which is measured between the sensors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can find out how great the instantaneous flow rate of the pressure medium through the pressure medium flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is. In lieu of the pressure sensors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> an electric generator, driven by the pressure medium, or a heating filament element could be arranged in the pressure medium flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for measuring the flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is furthermore joined with an injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by way of a connection <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Like the connections <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> the connection <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can also be a line, a radio link or an infrared connection. In the present case the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> possesses three parallel additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. It is however also possible for the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to possess only one additive passage duct or a plurality of additive passage ducts. Toward the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively have an outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. At the inlet end the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are joined with a supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which leads to additive supply containers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The supply containers are preferably designed in the form of replaceable cartridges and may be plugged or screwed on the supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> using flanges, not illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Additive, as for example oil, passes from the supply containers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by way of the supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In lieu of the supply containers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> a central additive supply means could also be provided, which in addition to the additive atomizing devices illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> would supply other additive atomizing devices as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> there are respective pressure producing devices, which will be explained in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A respective pressure pulse is exerted on the additive in the respective additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by the pressure producing devices so that for each pressure pulse one drop of additive is expelled into the pressure medium flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the respective outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The additive drops are indicated in the drawing with a collective index <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. After leaving the outlets <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> the additive drops <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are directed by a baffle means, which in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a baffle plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, in the pressure medium flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the direction <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the arrow and distributed in the pressure medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By way of a supply line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which pressure medium enters by way of an opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the additive supply containers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are subjected to pressure medium so that the additive is forced out of the supply containers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and accordingly into the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Such an arrangement for the supply of additive can be termed pseudo isobaric, because the factors in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> directly act on the additive supply. It is also possible for a pressure reducing means to be provided on the supply line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, it is possible for the supply line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> not to open into the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> but into the surroundings so that additive will be forced by the pressure of the surroundings into the supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from the supply containers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The pressure producing devices in the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are controlled by the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by way of connection <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and connections, not illustrated, located within the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As an input signal for the control of the pressure producing devices the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> evaluates the data from the sensors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the sensors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are for instance pressure sensors, a pressure gradient will be produced between these sensors during flow through the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of pressure medium, and from such pressure gradient the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> finds the instantaneous flow rate in the pressure medium flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If the flow rate is great, the requirement for additive to be injected in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will also be large and the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will so control pressure producing devices in the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that same inject numerous drops of additive in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this case the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will for instance apply high frequency voltage pulses to the pressure producing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is also possible for the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to be instructed by a higher order control, represented by an arrow <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, to produce a certain concentration of additive into the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Furthermore it is also possible for a local lower order control to be integrated in the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which controls the respective pressure producing devices locally in a manner dependent on commands, which are provided by the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> furthermore shows a heating means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is indicated in the form of a heating spiral diagrammatically. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the heating spiral acts on the supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and heats the additive in the supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that a certain viscosity of the additive may be set in the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is also possible for a cooling means to be arranged on the supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> instead of the heating means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or in addition to it, in order to lower the temperature of the additive in the supply line and thus produce a certain viscosity of the additive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Furthermore the heating means or the cooling means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as well may be arranged directly inside the injection head <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, preferably near the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so that adjacent to the outlets <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> the desired viscosity of the additive is ensured. Preferably then temperature sensors are provided in the vicinity of the additive passage ducts and as near as possible to the outlets <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, such sensors rendering possible regulation to get to the desired temperature. The heating means or, respectively, cooling means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be controlled by the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Furthermore the temperature sensors may be connected in the vicinity of the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Preferably the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or even the entire additive atomizing device illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is arranged in a housing thermally insulated from the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> the following will describe one example of a design of an additive passage duct, as for instance an additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> the additive the passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is illustrated in the form a chamber, which is constituted respectively by wall parts <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having an L-like cross section. Between the wall parts <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> there is an inlet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> through which the additive passes from an additive supply line, not illustrated, and for instance the supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, to the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. By the wall parts <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> an overflow <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is delimited, by way of which excess additive may flow out of the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into an overflow region, not illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The wall parts <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> hold a blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, which is made in two layers of piezoelectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> has electrical contact elements <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, to which a voltage may be applied, f. i. by the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. If such a voltage is applied, the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> will deform. Between wall parts <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> there is the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and in the working examples of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> is in the form of a group of nozzles with a plurality of closely adjacently outlet openings. To the rear and furthermore to the front, that is to say at plane behind the plane of the drawing and in front of the plane of the drawing the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is delimited by walls, not illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. It is also possible for several additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be arranged one after the other, to be supplied by a common inlet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> with additive and to have a common overflow <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, one respective blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> acting on a output <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with respectively one nozzle group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If a voltage is applied to the electrical contact elements <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> will move away from the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the form of a group of nozzles. The space then produced underneath the blade will fill with additive. In order to prevent the additive taking the shorter path back through the inlet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or the overflow <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, chokes are provided here, not illustrated. Therefore the contact elements <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are short circuited so that the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> swings back into its initial position forcing additive through the outlet. Such a condition is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. Fine drops of additive are then formed at the outlet openings of the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and distribute themselves in the pressure medium in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is not illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. By the brief application of voltage to the electrical contact elements <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and by the following short circuiting of the electrical contact elements the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> will be caused to perform a paddling movement in relation to the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> so that very fine drops or droplets of additive will be formed at the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in a manner dependent of the frequency and size of the voltage at the elements <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and such drops will be injected into the pressure medium flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As indicated supra it is possible for the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to be shifted away from the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> or toward it out of the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> by the application of voltage to the electrical contact elements <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. For this purpose a square pulse is f. i. suitable, so that during the rise of the leading edge of the pulse the blade will be moved away from the output <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and during its constant level phase the blade will be held for a short time in the position remote from the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, while corresponding to the trailing edge of the pulse the blade will swing toward the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The basic square signal of the voltage pulse can be modified in the following manner for metering the additive at the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> pulsed operation: packets of identical square pulses, which are generated with the same frequency, are applied to the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. By varying the number of the square pulses in a packet or the intervals between the respective packets it is possible to control the quantity of additive leaving by way of outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> pulse width modulation: the additive metering rate at the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is controlled by changing the width of the square pulses. It is also possible to vary the time interval between square pulses. Modulation forms in the case of which both the width of the square pulse and also the intervals between same are varied are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Amplitude modulation&rdquo; Here the square pulse will respectively have the same width and will be produced with the same frequency, but the height of the square pulses (voltage) will be varied. In a similar manner the deflection of the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in relation to the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and accordingly the quantity of additive injected through the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Hybrid forms of the above mentioned types of modulation and of pulsed operation are just as possible as other forms of influencing the square pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent dribbling of additive through the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> when the additive atomizing device is turned off, it may be necessary to seal off the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> when the system is not operating. This may be achieved by coating the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on the side facing the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with a suitable sealing material, the blade being suitably biased to lie against the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. However owing to the possibility of fracture of the blade same should not impact against outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> during ejection motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Such impact may be prevented in the following fashion: The blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is at a distance from the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in its resting position so that the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may somewhat overshoot the resting position. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in the resting or neutral position. For the sealing effect on the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> a negative voltage must be applied to the electrical contact elements <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to deflect the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> toward the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> till it makes contact. This condition is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. As an alternative the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> could also be so mechanically biased that, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, it contacts the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the neutral position. The blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> must therefore be operated with an offset voltage, which prevents impact of the blade <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> against outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> during operation. In the center position of the swinging motion the blade is then moved clear of the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and an injection head, which comprises such an additive passage duct, may be made extremely compact, namely of the order of size of some micrometers. Accordingly it is possible to directly incorporate the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a fluid technology device, as for example a pneumatic cylinder. Thus additive may always be supplied to the pneumatic cylinder in a systematic manner at the start of its working stroke. Even incorporation in a microvalve arrangement would readily be possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a still further possible working embodiment of the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and of a pressure producing device. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is an elongated and preferably capillary duct from which in the direction <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> additive is supplied, for instance from the supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> there is a heating resistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to which by way of electrical contact elements <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> square pulses may be applied by the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Such a square pulse will heat the resistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> for a short time so that a vapor bubble <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will be formed in the additive and an additive drop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will be ejected in the direction <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> from the outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. During the trailing edge of a square pulse and during the resting or neutral phase the resistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> will cool down again so that the vapor bubble present in the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will condense again. Then additive will be drawn by the capillary effect of the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the direction <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> into the additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is also possible for a working fluid such as water to be located over the heating resistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> which is held by a diaphragm over the heating resistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. If the water is heated for a short time by the heating resistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> a vapor bubble will form, which stretches the diaphragm and causes expulsion of the drop <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of additive. In this case the physical properties of the additive are irrelevant, since production of the vapor bubble is only dependent on the quality of the working fluid. Furthermore, the heating resistor can not be damaged by chemical or physical action of the additive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> directly, that is to say without an intermediately placed supply line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, connected with a cartridge-like supply container <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which is filled with additive. An inlet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of an additive supply duct <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> opens into the supply container <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to supply additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, of which in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> there are three arranged in parallelism in the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Outlets <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> open into a pressure medium flow duct not illustrated in the figure. The injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be either joined in a fixed manner, for example by bonding, to the container <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or may be detachable, there then being for instance a screw or bayonet joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> there is a respective heating resistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, as already described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, with which a vapor bubble may be produced in the respective additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As an alternative however piezoelectric, magnetostrictive or memory metallic blades or diaphragms, as described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, may be arranged in the respective additive passage ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as pressure producing devices. Connection lines <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> run from the heating resistors <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to the electrical contact elements <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, with which for instance the connection line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be connected. The injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a screw thread <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for screwing into the wall of a pressure medium flow duct, for example into the wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the pressure medium flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternatively however a plug, detent or bayonet connection would for example be possible too. Furthermore the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> possesses a sensor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, which is connected by way of a connection line <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with an electrical contact element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. By means of the sensor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> it is for example possible to detect the pressure or temperature in the respective pressure medium flow duct. By way of the electrical contact element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> the sensor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> may be joined with the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> essentially shows the additive atomizing device as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in which case however instead of the supply containers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> two of the cartridge-like containers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each with an injection <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, are arranged on the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The injection heads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are respectively illustrated in a highly simplified manner and respectively have only one additive passage duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In both additive passage ducts there are heating resistors, not separately referenced, or blades for the production of pressure pulses. The pressure producing devices are respectively controlled by way of a connection <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and, respectively, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> by the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> the injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is in operation and injects additive into the flow ducts <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is on standby and may be switched by the control <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the case of there being a greater additive requirement in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This means that it is extremely simple to replace respectively one of the cartridges <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the non-active state alone or in combination with the respective injection head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and so replace spent additive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Owing to the oblique setting of the flow ducts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the deflection baffle plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be unnecessary. It is also possible for the additive to be injected perpendicularly to the flow direction <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the pressure medium and only be deflected by the flow of the pressure medium and simultaneously distributed in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Furthermore a sensor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is arranged in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which passes on data by way of a connection <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. For instance, additive may deposit on the sensor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> so that the electrical conductivity at the surface of the sensor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> changes. The sensor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can measure this surface resistance and pass it on to the control <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The latter then finds the respectively current concentration of additive on the basis of the respective resistance value. The control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can therefore so drive the pressure producing devices that there is an even additive concentration in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can also be subject to a target value for the additive concentration coming from an external control, for example by way of a field bus connection or a corresponding parametric synthesis. In addition or as an alternative it is possible for the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to evaluate the flow rate as found by the sensors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, of the pressure medium in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide for suitable control of the pressure producing devices in the injection heads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> or the sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may also measure the temperature in the flow duct <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, dependent on which the control means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> then drives the pressure producing devices. </paragraph>
