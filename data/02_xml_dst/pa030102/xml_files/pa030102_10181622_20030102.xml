<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an elastic composite sheet and a method of manufacturing the same, and more particularly, it relates to an elastic composite sheet obtained by subjecting an existing nonwoven fabric of low extensibility to a extensibility-giving work such as pleating work, so as to increase the extensibility of the existing nonwoven fabric and by bonding thermoplastic elastomer to the nonwoven fabric, and a method of the elastic composite sheet. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many elastic sheets used for elastic portions of a disposable diaper or various clothes are usually sheets made by bonding a nonwoven fabric with elastomer. In these sheets, since nonwoven fabrics, such as the spunbonded nonwoven fabric and the chemical-bonded nonwoven fabric, are poor in the elongation thereof, if bonded with the elastomer, these fabrics cannot show elasticity with an extended range of elongation. To solve this problem, for example, Japanese publications of unexamined application Nos. 213543/91 and 31833/94 disclose a method of manufacturing an elastic material by partially bonding elongated rubber threads with the nonwoven fabrics. Also, Japanese publication of unexamined application No. 59901/84 discloses a means for discontinuously bonding an elastomer net with a pleated nonwoven fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Further, the present Applicant et al. have been disclosed an elastic composite sheet employing unidirectionally stretched nonwoven fabric in Japanese publications of unexamined application Nos. 174764/96 and 222759/99. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, of late years, for example, the disposable diaper has been requested to be of high quality but of high productivity at a low price, and therefore, it has become difficult for the conventional technology in which the elastomer in elongated state is partially bonded with a nonwoven fabric to cope with the request. Furthermore, since the elastomer is of bad formability, and is high priced, the use of existing elastomer products such as an elastomer net makes it difficult to acquire a low priced elastic composite sheet. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an elastic composite sheet capable of being manufactured by less use of elastomer while adopting a simpler process, being of high quality and besides of high productivity at a low manufacturing cost, and a method of manufacturing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, an elastic composite sheet according to the present invention comprises a extensible nonwoven fabric including non-elastic fibers, and subjected to a extensibility giving work to thereby have elongation of equal to or more than 100% in at least one direction and, a thermoplastic elastomer layer having a pattern with a directional property in a direction in which the extensible nonwoven fabric has the elongation of equal to or more than 100%, and bonded to the stretchable nonwoven fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The thermoplastic elastomer layer having the above-described pattern can be either a plurality of strands including thermoplastic elastomer and aligned in a direction in which the extensible nonwoven fabric has the elongation of equal to or more than 100% or a web including thermoplastic elastomer. Particularly, when the thermoplastic elastomer layer is formed of the web, the web may preferably be made of a film formed with an opening elongated in a direction in which the extensible nonwoven fabric has the elongation of equal to or more than 100%, a nonwoven fabric in which fibers are aligned in a direction in which the extensible nonwoven fabric has the elongation of equal to or more than 100%, or a web having lost a restitutive force by being held at a temperature equal to or higher than a flow-starting temperature of the thermoplastic elastomer under a extended state in a direction in which the extensible nonwoven fabric has the elongation of equal to or larger than 100%. It should be understood that a web means a general sheet like material throughout the description of the present specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the elastic composite sheet of the present invention, since the thermoplastic elastomer layer is provided with the pattern having the directional property in the direction in which the extensible nonwoven fabric has elongation equal to or more than 100%, and is bonded with the extensible nonwoven fabric, regardless of a lessened amount of elastomer, the sheet can effectively exhibit its elasticity. Lessening of the mount of use of elastomer contributes to not only reducing the manufacturing cost but also ensuring lightweight of the elastic composite sheet, so that a great advantage may be brought for the disposable diaper and the clothes which are requested to be made of lightweight material. Further, the stretchable nonwoven fabric may include of commercially available mass-produced nonwoven fabrics after applying thereto extensibility giving work, and therefore it is possible to select some from the existing various nonwoven fabrics by taking into considerations the performance and the cost of such fabrics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A method of manufacturing an elastic composite sheet according to the present invention, comprises the steps of forming a extensible nonwoven fabric having elongation of equal to or larger than 100% in at least one direction by subjecting a raw nonwoven fabric including non-elastic fibers to extensibility giving work, and bonding a layer of thermoplastic elastomer to the extensible nonwoven fabric in a pattern having a directional property in a direction in which the said stretchable nonwoven fabric has the said elongation of equal to or larger than 100%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the method of manufacturing the elastic composite sheet of the present invention, the elastic composite sheet capable of effectively exhibiting elasticity with a lessened amount of elastomer can be simply manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Since the thermoplastic elastomer is inferior in its formability, forming of the layer of thermoplastic elastomer as strands made of thermoplastic elastomer is the simplest and stable method for manufacture. Further, the thermoplastic elastomer layer may be constituted by a film or a web of nonwoven fabric or the like. In such case, the web should be held in a extended state in a direction in which the extensible nonwoven fabric had elongation of equal to or more than 100%, and should preferably be maintained at a temperature equal to or higher than the flow-starting temperature of the thermoplastic elastomer until the restitutive force of the web has been lost. When the web is extended, the thickness of the web is reduced, and the feel and flexibility thereof may be increased. Furthermore, when the web is extended, the thickness thereof can be reduced, and accordingly the web before being extended might be thick. In this regard, since the thermoplastic elastomer is difficult to be manufactured in a uniformly thin web, a thick web of thermoplastic elastomer is easier to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the term &ldquo;longitudinal direction&rdquo; that is used for explaining of the direction of elasticity of the composite sheet and the direction of stretch of a fiber means a direction in which, during either the manufacture of a nonwoven fabric or the bonding of the nonwoven fabric with the elastomer, the fabric is subjected to being machined, i.e., the fabric is fed. The term &ldquo;transverse direction&rdquo; means a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, i.e., the direction corresponding to a widthwise direction of the nonwoven fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further, the term &ldquo;non-elastic fiber&rdquo; means a conventional fiber, which does not show any rubber elasticity as is shown by the elastomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;fiber&rdquo; means a fiber in a broad sense, including a short fiber and a continuous filament. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;raw nonwoven fabric&rdquo; means a nonwoven fabric that is a crude fabric material, which is formed into a extensible nonwoven fabric when it is subjected to a extensibility giving work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further, the term &ldquo;thermoplastic elastomer&rdquo; means a material that is softened by heating to be of fluidity, but shows rubber elasticity at an approximately room temperature.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Now, the embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has a constitution that onto one face of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having elongation of equal to or more than 100% in a longitudinal direction, a plurality of strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> including thermoplastic elastomer are bonded. Strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are arranged to be spaced apart from one another in a transverse direction of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and are aligned in a longitudinal direction corresponding to the stretching direction of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is constituted by applying extensibility giving work in a longitudinal direction to a raw nonwoven fabric including non-elastic fibers, and hereby it can be elongated in a longitudinal direction at elongation of equal to or more than 100%. As the non-elastic fiber, any of fibers consisting of synthetic fiber use polymer such as conventional polypropylene, polyamide, and polyester, fibers consisting of natural fibers such as cotton and silk, and fibers consisting of semi-synthetic fiber such as rayon and acetate may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Nonwoven fabric used as raw nonwoven fabric could include not only spunbonded nonwoven fabrics in a broad sense, such as commercially available spunbonded nonwoven fabric, melt blown nonwoven fabric and flash-spun nonwoven fabric, but also chemical-bonded nonwoven fabric, thermal-bonded nonwoven fabric, wet nonwoven fabric, dry nonwoven fabric, and filament nonwoven fabric such as cross laminated nonwoven fabric as disclosed in e.g., Japanese Published Examined Patent Application No. 36948/91. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Many of these raw nonwoven fabrics have already been mass-produced and on sale, and therefore they are easily available at a low price. Further, with regard to the thickness of these fabrics, there are various types fabrics from thin to thicker fabrics while having various functions, and accordingly it is possible to select some of them to be used. However, these raw nonwoven fabrics are usually either small in elongation thereof or large in its extending stress although having elongation, and therefore even if the raw nonwoven fabric is bonded with an elastic material such as an elastomer, it could not be used as an elastic composite material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Thus, the extensibility giving work is applied to such raw nonwoven fabric to acquire extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the acquired fabric is bonded with a thermoplastic elastomer. Hereby, a high performance elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be simply manufactured at a low price. Further, since strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are arranged to be spaced apart from one another, air permeability that an extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> per se possesses, is not damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The extensibility giving work could be various physical or chemical works such as softening work, pleating work, contracting work, and fulling work which are respectively applied to the raw nonwoven fabric so as to allow the raw nonwoven fabric to have suitable loose and flexibility, whereby the raw nonwoven fabric may have elongation of equal to or more than 100%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The softening work could include not only a softening work in a narrow sense, which is an application of softening agent to a nonwoven fabric, but also works for acquiring a flexible nonwoven fabric having a large elongation by employing a physical means, and which do not permit observable formation of pleats, for example, shrink proofing work such as the Sanforized work, and embossing work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The pleating work includes folding work, and provides a fabric with many regular or irregular small crinkles, pleats or folds so as to give extensibility to the fabric. Examples of method of pleating in the transverse direction so as to increase elongation in a longitudinal direction could be a mechanical shrink proofing work, such as the Sanforized work (refer to U.S. Pat. No. 2,324,245) and the broad stuffing box (refer to Japanese Publication of Examined Patent Application No. 41742/93), a work utilizing a manufacturing method of a creped paper in the paper manufacturing industry, and a work employing a pair of engaged rollers having multiple axial grooves to provide the fabric with pleats in a longitudinal direction. Further, it is possible to acquire a nonwoven fabric having elasticity in either longitudinal or transverse direction by suitably contriving the pattern of embossing. In any one of the above-listed works, as far as it were able to produce pleats, such work could be included in the pleating work referred to in the specification of the present application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The contracting work should be understood as a work for physically or chemically contracting a fabric, and includes a work for intertwining fibers, which is usually referred to as the fulling work. The contracting work is also partially common with the above-mentioned softening work. A method of physically contracting a fabric in either a longitudinal or transverse direction can be, for example, the method as disclosed in Japanese publication of unexamined application No. 57620/94. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The extensible nonwoven fabric acquired by the application of the above-described extensibility giving work is provided with extensibility in one of the various directions including its longitudinal, transverse, or diagonal direction, or in a plurality of directions. The elongation of this fabric is of equal to or larger than 100% in at least one direction, preferably 150%, and most preferably 200%. Although an upper limit of the elongation of the extensible nonwoven fabric is not specifically delimited, from the viewpoint of adaptation to a practical elastic composite sheet, the extensible nonwoven fabrics having elongation of up to 1000% are usable. When the extensible nonwoven fabric has an elongation of equal to or larger than 100% in at least one direction, it was experimentally confirmed that the composite sheet including the extensible nonwoven fabric and the elastomer can show such elasticity that even after application of elongation of equal to or more than 200% to the sheet in the above-mentioned one direction, the sheet is able to repeat elastic recovery. The elongation is measured pursuant to JIS-L1085 (the Japanese Industrial Standards). Namely, a rectangular sample of 5 cm width is grasped at a spacing of 10 cm between grasping positions, and is extended at a speed of 30 cm per one minute. Then, when the sample is broken, a change in the spacing between the grasping positions is measured, and is indicated as an elongation by the rate &ldquo;%&rdquo; of the measured result to the amount of spacing before the extending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> include thermoplastic elastomer, and the thermoplastic elastomer is supplied onto extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> under a state where it is melted by heating, and is thereafter cooled to a room temperature, so that it is bonded to extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The thermoplastic elastomer is used because the latter can be bonded to the nonwoven fabric simultaneously with the forming thereof to thereby permit a composite sheet to be manufactured by simple manufacturing steps, and as a result an inexpensive composite sheet can be acquired. As the thermoplastic elastomer, many kinds of elastomer such as polyolefins elastomer, synthetic rubbers, polyesters elastomer, polyamides elastomer, and polyurethanes elastomer may be employed. In the elastomer, the synthetic rubbers elastomer, i.e., one obtained by copolymerization of styrene and olefin, and polyurethanes elastomer can show an elasticity of large magnification and can be small in its stress upon being subjected to an elastic condition. Thus, both can be the optimum elastomer for the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Further, as described above, strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are aligned in a longitudinal direction of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Hereby, strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed in a pattern having a directional property in a direction in which extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has elongation of equal to or larger than 100%, and as a result it can give elasticity in an aimed direction of elastic motion to elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while reducing the amount of use of elastomer. Therefore, it is able to effectively use the thermoplastic elastomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As the pattern of the thermoplastic elastomer, the pattern in which the thermoplastic elastomer is formed in strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is the most preferable one. By aligning strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> including the thermoplastic elastomer in the direction of elastic motion of elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the minimum amount of elastomer can be most effectively used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The thermoplastic elastomer is usually inferior in its formability, and particularly, the thermoplastic elastomer suitable for e.g., a disposable diaper in which elastic motion showing elongation of equal to or more than 200% is repeated, is inferior in its formability. Therefore, forming of the thermoplastic elastomer in strands, which are the simplest form, is suitable for stably manufacturing a high quality composite sheet at a low price. The &ldquo;strand&rdquo; includes, in addition to a relatively fine endless or quasi-endless form usually referred to as a filament, a relatively thick endless or quasi-endless form. Usually, the filament is of at most around several hundreds tex, but the filament of several thousands tex is included in the specification of the present Application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, an embodiment of a manufacturing method of elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> initially passes through between a pair of gear rollers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Gear rollers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are respectively provided with many convexo-concaves, which are alternately arranged around the entire circumferential surface of respective gear rollers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and are formed so as to extend over the entire region in a direction parallel with the rotating axis of respective gear rollers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the convexo-concaves of respective gear rollers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged to engage with one another. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for brevity sake, only a part of the convexo-concaves of gear rollers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are illustrated. Due to passing of raw nonwoven fabric through between gear rollers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, convexo-concaves are formed in raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which are copied from the convexo-concaves of gear rollers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, to generate convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. In the present embodiment, the pitch and the height of the convexo-concaves of gear rollers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are designed so that the cycle of appearance of the convexo-concaves of the acquired convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is approximately 1 mm, and the depth of the same convexo-concaves is approximately 1 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is subjected to the pleating work. In the pleating work, by the use of a pair of heating cylinders <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, with which rubber nip rollers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are kept in press-contact, heating and pressing effects are applied to convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; so as to collapse convexo-concaves of convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; by pressure. Namely, convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is pinched by and pressed between nip roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and heating cylinder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, between both heating cylinders <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and heating cylinder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and nip roller <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, so that convexo-concaves thereof are collapsed by pressure, and during this collapsing operation, it is kept in tight contact with the circumferential surface of heating cylinders <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so as to be subjected to heat treatment. Hereby, convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is formed with many pleats in transverse direction, and extensibility in longitudinal direction is given thereto to become extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When a nonwoven fabric is subjected to the pleating work, the formed pleats might sometime gradually disappear due to the restoring force of the nonwoven fabric. In that case, it becomes difficult to manufacture a composite sheet having stable elasticity. Thus, by heat treating the nonwoven fabric under pleated condition with the apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pleats given to the nonwoven fabric may be kept stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> At this stage, the nonwoven fabric should preferably be subjected to heat treatment at a temperature equal to or more than the softening point of the fibers constituting the nonwoven fabric. The softening point of the fibers will change depending on how degree the molecular orientation of the fibers is advanced during the process of forming a nonwoven fabric from the fibers and also depending on the thermal history to which the fibers are subjected during the formation of the nonwoven fabric. For example, polyester has a softening point in the temperature range from 100&deg; C. through 250&deg; C.; and polypropylene has a softening point in the temperature range from 100&deg; C. through 160&deg; C. Therefore, within these temperature ranges, an optimum temperature is selected depending on the advancement of the molecular orientation and the thermal history. Further, in the case of polymers having hydrophilic group such as polyamides, polyvinyl alcohols, and celluloses polymers, it might be advantageous that the heat treatment is applied under moistened and heated condition in which moisture is suspended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thus acquired is horizontally conveyed by a conveyor (not illustrated). During the horizontal conveyance of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thermoplastic elastomer in melted condition is extruded from each of a number of monofilament dies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> arranged above extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the extruded thermoplastic elastomer reaches extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> before it solidifies. Monofilament dies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are transversely arranged at a pitch of 5 mm, and extrusion of the thermoplastic elastomer from monofilament dies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> thus arranged permits formation of a number of strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> including the thermoplastic elastomer on extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be aligned longitudinally of that extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed on extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, before solidifying of such strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is nipped by a pair of nip rollers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so as to be cooled. Thus, strands <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are integrated into one body, and elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is resultantly acquired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Although it is well known to form the thermoplastic elastomer into a strand-shape by using nozzles, in the present embodiment, formation of the thermoplastic elastomer into the strand-shape is combined with the extensibility giving work of the nonwoven fabric, and further during the forming process of strands, the strands before solidifying are urged to reach the nonwoven fabric, and are solidified on the nonwoven fabric so as to be attached to or bonded with the nonwoven fabric to thereby produce a composite sheet having elasticity in a longitudinal direction. Although the thermoplastic elastomer is inferior in its capability of being spun, it is rather easy to carry out spinning of relatively thick strands by employing the above-described simple apparatus, and hereby elastic composite sheets may be simply and safely manufactured at a high speed and at a good productivity. Further, since the strands are aligned in a longitudinal direction in which the elastic composite sheet of the present embodiment makes an elastic motion, the strands can exhibit a longitudinal elastic characteristic with a small amount of elastomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, an elastic composite sheet to which extensibility in a longitudinal direction is given, is formed by employing the apparatus using gear rollers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Hereunder, another means for forming an elastic composite sheet to which extensibility in a longitudinal direction is given will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The apparatus illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is provided with endless rubber belt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, four turn rollers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>around which the endless rubber belt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is wound, and heating cylinder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> pressed against the outer face of rubber belt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> between two turn rollers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Rubber belt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is extended on the circumferential surface of turn roller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>arranged on upstream side of heating cylinder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> with respect to the running direction thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied while being kept in tight contact with the extended rubber belt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and is accommodated in heating cylinder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, in pursuant to the running of rubber belt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Since rubber belt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is extended on turn roller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, when rubber belt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> moves apart from turn roller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to be transferred onto heating cylinder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, rubber belt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> will shrink in its running direction, i.e., in a longitudinal direction. Hereby, raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in tight contact with the extended rubber belt <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> also shrinks in the longitudinal direction on heating cylinder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. This longitudinal shrinkage and heat treatment by heat transmitted from heating cylinder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> permit acquirement of an extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is given extensibility in the longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The apparatus illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is provided with heating cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> rotating in a direction indicated by an arrow and circulating sheet <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> running along the circumferential surface of heating cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, being guided by turn roller <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is nipped by nip rollers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and is fed into a gap between heating cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and circulating sheet <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The running speed of circulating sheet <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is smaller than a feeding speed of raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> given by nip rollers <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Thus, in the gap in which raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fed, raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is folded, and with such folded condition, raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is pinched by heating cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and circulating sheet <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The pinched raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment by heat transmitted from heating cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to thereby permit acquirement of a extensible nonwoven fabric which is given extensibility in the longitudinal direction. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is constituted by bonding a plurality of strands <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of thermoplastic onto one face of a extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having elongation of equal to or more than 100% in a transverse direction. Extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is acquired by applying an extensibility giving work to a raw nonwoven fabric including non-elastic fibers in a transverse direction, and hereby it is extensible in the transverse direction at elongation of equal to or larger than 100%. Strands <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are aligned in a transverse direction corresponding to the extending direction of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> while being mutually spaced apart in the longitudinal direction of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The kind of raw nonwoven fabric, material of nonelastic fibers constituting the nonwoven fabric, the kind of work for giving extensibility, the range of elongation of extensible nonwoven fabric obtained by the result of extensibility giving work, and the material of thermoplastic elastomer constituting strands <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are identical with those of the first embodiment, and therefore, any description thereof will be omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Next, an embodiment of a manufacturing method of the composite sheet according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> firstly passes through between a pair of gear rollers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, gear rollers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided with a number of convexo-concave alternately arranged in a direction parallel with the rotating axis of respective gear rollers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and formed in the entire circumferential surface of gear rollers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The convexo-concaves of respective gear rollers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are also arranged to be mutually engaged. When raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passes between these gear rollers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed with convexo-concaves copied from the convexo-concaves of gear rollers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to become convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;. In the present embodiment, the pitch and the height of the convexo-concaves of gear rollers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are set so that the convexo-concaves of the obtained convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; have the cycle of approximately 1 mm, and the depth of approximately 1 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; is subsequently subjected to the pleating work. The pleating work is conducted in such a manner that a pair of heating cylinders <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>against which rubber nip rollers <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are pressed, respectively, heat and pressurize convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; so as to collapse convexo-concaves of convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; by pressure. Namely, convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; is pinched by and pressed between nip roller <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and heating cylinder <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, between both heating cylinders <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and between heating cylinder <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and nip roller <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, so that convexo-concaves thereof are collapsed by pressure, and during this collapsing operation, it is kept in tight contact with the circumferential surface of heating cylinders <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so as to be subjected to heat treatment. Temperature for the heat treatment is selected to be equal to or higher than a softening point of fibers constituting the nonwoven fabric. Hereby, convexo-concaved nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; is stably formed with a number of pleating in a longitudinal direction so that the extensibility in the transverse direction is given, and thus extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is acquired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> thus acquired is conveyed toward an elastomer spinning mechanism for spinning thermoplastic elastomer to extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a strand-shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the elastomer spinning mechanism is provided with a forming unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> for forming extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a cylindrical shape, elastomer spinning unit <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> for spinning thermoplastic elastomer to the inner face of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> formed in the cylindrical shape by forming unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, and developing unit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for developing the cylindrically-shaped extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> spun with the thermoplastic elastomer, into a planar shape fabric. </paragraph>

The forming system of this kind is generally used in a forming machine for flexible package, and the system is often referred to as a sailor former or merely a former since the outer shape thereof resembles the collar of a sailor suit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Developing unit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is practically a unit installed by inverting forming unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> upside down, and therefore when extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> passes through developing unit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> along a passage reverse to that permitting the fabric to pass through forming unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, the cylindrically formed extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is developed into a planar shape fabric. Developing unit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be any type of unit if it has a developing function. For example, it may be possible to utilize a developing system employing a triangular frame generally used for developing a cylindrical film obtained by inflation film forming. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is a hollow cylindrical member having an annular opening <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at an upper end face thereof and closed at its lower end face. The outer circumferential wall of spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is provided with nozzle <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>communicating between the inner hollow portion of spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and the exterior thereof. In this embodiment, although it is shown that spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> has a cylinder construction, spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> may be provided with any construction capable of spinning elastomer by the use of centrifugal force, and therefore it may be constructed in a member of a propeller shape of an airplane, or a hollow-shape with a cross-section of a triangle, a rectangle, or a cross, and rotating about a center of gravity to spin the elastomer from the outer circumferential surface of the member. Further, the spinning head might be formed in a member of a polygonal columnar shape. However, generation of turbulence of air around the spinning head during the rotation thereof will spoil the stability of spinning condition, and accordingly the employment of a cylindrical shape is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Further, although it is shown that spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is constructed to have, at its upper end, opening <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, if dispersion of the melt elastomer into the atmosphere is not desirable, it may be formed in a tightly closed construction. In that case, it may be considered that support shaft <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> will be formed in a double shaft construction having inner and outer tubes between which melt elastomer will be furnished to the spinning head, and rotational drive will be achieved by a transmitting shaft disposed inside the inner tube. The number of nozzle <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed may be plural in response to the later-described pitch of alignment of strands of the elastomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Above spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, there is disposed supply pipe <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> having an end (a lower end) exposed to the interior of the upper end opening <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Supply pipe <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is connected to extruder or gear pump (not shown), and the elastomer is fed to spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> through this supply pipe <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> in the melt state or as thick dope. Spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is provided with heaters <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, respectively, arranged at its upper and lower portions thereof, and when spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is heated by these heaters <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, the temperature of the elastomer within spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is kept at a temperature suitable for being spun from nozzle <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The operation of this elastomer spinning system will now be described. As described above, sheet-like extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed into a cylindrical shape by forming unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, and is conveyed downward along the inner wall face of guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. In other words, extensible unwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having formed into a cylindrical shape is moved along the axis of guide cylinder <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> in the interior of such guide cylinder <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> At this time, spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is rotated while thermoplastic elastomer in melt condition is being fed from supply pipe <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> into spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, so that the supplied thermoplastic elastomer fed in to spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is centrifugally spun. As a result, the spun thermoplastic elastomer attaches to the inner circumferential face of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> before it solidifies, and then solidifies on extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to thereby be bonded with extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Thus, spinning of the thermoplastic elastomer by the use of the centrifugal force due to the rotation of spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> permits the thermoplastic elastomer to attach to the inner circumferential face of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> along the circumferential direction of guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. Also, during this process, since extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is conveyed downward, the thermoplastic elastomer is spirally bonded with the inner circumferential face of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> passes through developing unit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to be developed into a sheet-shape, so as to become elastic composite sheet consisting of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the thermoplastic elastomer. Through appropriate setting of the feeding speed of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the rotating speed of spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, the thermoplastic elastomer is aligned in strands in a direction approximately perpendicular to the width direction of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, so that elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> capable of being greatly elastic in the width direction can be acquired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Since the thermoplastic elastomer is continuously spun to extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to vertically sever extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for the purpose of developing the cylindrical-shape extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in order to sever extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to which the thermoplastic elastomer has been spun, a cutter (not shown) for severing extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a direction corresponding to the feeding direction of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided between spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and developing unit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which is severed by the cutter, is developed into a planar shape by developing unit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having been developed while it passes through developing unit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is wounded onto winding roller <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> via paired rollers <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Thus, by forming extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> into a cylindrical shape, and spinning thermoplastic elastomer on the inner circumferential face thereof from rotating spinning head <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> to make it bond to extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the thermoplastic elastomer is able to simply and rapidly form strands. Further, the strands of thermoplastic elastomer are aligned in a transverse direction corresponding to a direction in which elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is elastic, and therefore regardless of a small amount of elastomer, transverse elastic property can be effectively exhibited. Furthermore, since this elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constituted by bonding extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with thermoplastic elastomer, even if basis weight of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is small, the elastic property thereof is not worsened, and accordingly a required amount of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may also be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is shown a case where extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having passed through forming unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is immediately fed into guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. When a web is formed into a cylindrical shape, there is often provided a device for thermally sealing opposite ends of the web between forming unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. However, in the present embodiment, forming of nonwoven fabric into a cylindrical shape is not an aim, and therefore such sealing device is not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the width of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the inner circumferential length of guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> should ideally correspond to one another. Nevertheless, in practical, due to either an irregularity of the end of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or meandering of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, it is very difficult to achieve complete correspondence of both. Therefore, it is desirable to make the width of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> larger than the length of the inner circumferential face of guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. This is because if the width of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is insufficient, there appears a gap between opposite ends of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> left inside guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. In the portion of the gap, thermoplastic elastomer will be directly spun against guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> to be fixedly secured to the portion thereof. Thus, the portion to which thermoplastic elastomer is fixedly secured and a portion of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to which thermoplastic elastomer is spun will pull against each other, and accordingly feeding of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Further, as the property of elastomer, the spun elastomer after attaching to extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will be released from a extend by a tensile force that is exhibited by the centrifugal force, and as a result, such spun elastomer has an action to shrink extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the direction of the strands. Therefore, even if the width of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the inner circumferential length of guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> are brought into correspondence to one another, the above-mentioned shrinking action causes reduction in the width of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the lower portion of guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, to thereby generate a gap between extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. For the above-described reason, it is practical to make the width of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> larger than the inner circumferential length of guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> When elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is developed, it is possible to use a plurality of cutters for severing the fabric into a plurality of composite sheets. In this case, developing unit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be replaced by a simpler mechanism, for example, a plurality of set of turn rollers. This is advantageous in that the mechanism can be quite simplified, so long as there is no problem in that the width of the acquired respective composite sheets will narrow. On the other hand, the cylindrical extensible nonwoven fabric spun with the thermoplastic elastomer may be flattened as it stands, so that an elastic composite sheet having a constitution that strands of thermoplastic elastomer are sandwiched by extensible nonwoven fabric may be acquired. In this latter case, developing unit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of the apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> will not be necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, by the use of gear rollers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an extensible nonwoven fabric provided with extensibility in a transverse direction is formed. A description of the other means for forming an extensible nonwoven fabric provided with extensibility in a transverse direction will be provided hereunder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The apparatus illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is extensibility giving work apparatus <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, which gives extensibility in a transverse direction to a raw nonwoven fabric preliminarily formed in a cylindrical shape by forming convexo-concaves in the fabric in a longitudinal direction. Extensibility giving work apparatus <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is provided with a cylinder <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> through which a cylindrically formed raw nonwoven fabric passes, and vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> disposed on the outside of this cylinder <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Cylinder <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is formed, in its inner circumferential face, with a number of grooves <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending along the axis of cylinder <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. Respective grooves <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed with a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>arranged along grooves <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and communicated with vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is connected to a vacuum blower (not shown) via hose <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>. By the drive of the vacuum blower, the pressure prevailing in vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is brought into a negative pressure, and the air is sucked into vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> via apertures <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> When the preliminarily cylindrically formed raw nonwoven fabric is guided into the interior of cylinder <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, the raw nonwoven fabric is brought into tight contact with the inner circumferential face of cylinder <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, due to the suction of the air through apertures <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Since the inner circumferential face of cylinder <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> has grooves <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed therein, the raw nonwoven fabric is formed with convexo-concaves copied from the shape of grooves <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>pursuant to the movement of the raw nonwoven fabric along the axis of cylinder <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. Hereby, the raw nonwoven fabric becomes an extensible nonwoven fabric to which extensibility in transverse direction is given. In this connection, cylinder <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> should desirably be heated to a temperature equal to or more than the softening point of the thermoplastic elastomer constituting the raw nonwoven fabric. Then, the raw nonwoven fabric formed with convexo-concaves can be subjected to heat treatment, so that the convexo-concaves formed in the raw nonwoven fabric may be made stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> This extensibility giving work apparatus <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> can be combined with the elastomer spinning device illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. When the elastomer spinning device illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and extensibility giving work apparatus <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> are combined together, instead of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, raw nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fed to the forming unit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As a concrete constitution of the combination of extensibility giving work apparatus <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the elastomer spinning device, extensibility giving work apparatus <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be disposed between forming unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> or replace guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the case that extensibility giving work apparatus <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is disposed between forming unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, thermoplastic elastomer will be spun toward extensible nonwoven fabric formed by passing through extensibility giving work apparatus <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case that extensibility giving work apparatus <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> replaces guide cylinder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, the extensibility giving work apparatus <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is arranged so that the axial length thereof is equivalent to the length of the guide cylinder, and thermoplastic elastomer is spun toward nonwoven fabric within cylinder <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. Hereby, both formation of an extensible nonwoven fabric and bonding of the strands of thermoplastic elastomer with the extensible nonwoven fabric may be simultaneously achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> (Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is an embodiment of one requested to be elastic in a longitudinal direction, and is provided with such a constitution that reticulated film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is a web made of thermoplastic elastomer, is bonded to one face of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having elongation of equal to or more than 100% in the longitudinal direction. Reticulated film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed with a number of openings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>lengthened in a longitudinal direction corresponding to a direction in which extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has elongation of equal to or more than 100%. Extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to that described in the first embodiment, and accordingly any specified description thereof is omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> A detailed description of reticulated film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will be provided hereinafter. Reticulated film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is produced by fabricating a raw film including thermoplastic elastomer. An ordinary film manufactured, for example, by the T-die method or by cutting and spreading a tubular film may be used as the raw film. The thermoplastic elastomer that is a raw material of the raw film may be the elastomer similar to that used in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, in order to form openings <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> number of slits <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which are long in a longitudinal direction (the direction of an arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) are formed in raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> including thermoplastic elastomer, in a staggered manner as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Subsequently, raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> formed with slits <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is extended in a longitudinal direction. Such extending of raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction causes shrinkage of raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in a transverse direction while extension of silts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the longitudinal direction, and as a result, slits <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed in openings <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Then, raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> having been extended in the longitudinal direction is, under a condition as it is, heated at a temperature equal to or higher than the starting point of flow of the thermoplastic elastomer that constituting raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. This heating of raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> under its extended condition is continued until a restitutive force of raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> disappears. Then, even if a given tensile force applied to raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is removed, raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> maintains its shape illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, so that reticulated film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be acquired. The heating temperature of raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> should preferably be kept at a temperature equal to or higher than 10&deg; C. through 20&deg; C. of the flow-starting temperature for the purpose of shortening the heating time, and more preferably be kept at a temperature equal to or higher than 30&deg; C. through 50&deg; C. of the flow-starting temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The flow-starting temperature corresponds to a glass-transition temperature in the case where the hardened segment of thermoplastic elastomer is non-crystalline polymer, and the flow of the thermoplastic elastomer commences at a temperature equal to or higher than that temperature. When the hardened segment is crystalline, the flow-starting temperature corresponds to the temperature of fusion of the crystal, and the flow of the thermoplastic elastomer commences at a temperature equal to or higher than that temperature of fusion. The glass-transition temperature and the temperature of fusion of the thermoplastic elastomer are measured by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimeter) according to JIS K 7121. Besides, The glass-transition temperature or the temperature of fusion is generally lower when measurement is conducted with the thermoplastic elastomer than when polymer element of the hardened segment is measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The width of reticulate film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> becomes smaller than that of raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> finally, and therefore the width of raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is determined by taking into consideration a required width of reticulated film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the extending magnification of raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> When thus acquired reticulated film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is bonded to extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> may be manufactured. At the time of bonding of both, since reticulated film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes thermoplastic elastomer, merely heating reticulated film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> under a condition such that reticulated film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are superposed upon each other, can easily bond reticulated film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, reticulated film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be simply and cheaply bonded together without usage of any adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> During the bonding process of extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and reticulated film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the film before heating (raw film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> formed with slits <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) might be extended and superposed on extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and might subsequently be heated under such superposed condition, so that disappearance of the restitutive force of the film as well as the bonding of the film and extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may simultaneously be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the present embodiment, the web including thermoplastic elastomer is extended, and is heated, as it is, so as to cause disappearance of the restitutive force of the film and bonding to the extensible nonwoven fabric. Thus, the extending of the web permits the openings of the web to be extended thereby enhancing air permeability thereof and an efficiency of utilization of thermoplastic elastomer in the extending direction of the web. As a result, an effective extending property can be obtained at a small amount of elastomer. The extending magnification of the web is usually twice, and should preferably be thrice or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Further, the web is made thinner by extending it, and consequently the feeling of the web is improved while causing an increase in its flexibility, so that the elastic composite sheet may be more adapted for use in production of a disposable diaper and clothes. Since the web is extended, it is understood that a raw web may be made thicker by an amount of extending magnification. Accordingly, by this method of extending a web, even thermoplastic elastomer, which is usually difficult to be fabricated in a thin raw web having a uniform thickness, might be used for simply forming a web having a uniform thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, although an embodiment of an elastic composite sheet having elasticity in the longitudinal direction has been described, when an elastic composite sheet is needed to be elastic in a transverse direction, such elastic composite sheet may be acquired by bonding a reticulated film having openings elongated in a transverse direction with a extensible nonwoven fabric similar to that of the second embodiment. This reticulated film can be formed in such a manner that a raw film formed with slits in a transverse direction is extended in the transverse direction, and under this condition, the raw film is then heated at a temperature equal to or higher than the flow-starting temperature of the thermoplastic elastomer so that disappearance of the restitutive force may be caused. When a web is extended in a transverse direction, the width after being extended is broadened, so that a raw fabric of a small width may be formed in a product having a large width, and therefore such extending method is suitable for accomplishing forming of a thermoplastic elastomer, which is inferior in its formability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A direction in which a web is extended is determined in response to a direction in which an elastic composite sheet aims to have elasticity. Namely, when an elastic composite sheet aims to have elasticity in a longitudinal direction, a web should be extended in the longitudinal direction, and when an elastic composite sheet aims to have elasticity in a transverse direction, a web should be extended in the transverse direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As described above, a web is extended in one direction. Nevertheless, even if a web is extended in two directions, so long as the extending magnifications in respective extending directions are different from one another, and so long as a balance between the longitudinal and transverse directions is lost, it should be understood that such extending in the two directions would be included in the extending in one direction as defined by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As an extending means, a conventional stretching means for a film and a nonwoven fabric may be employed. For example, when stretching in a longitudinal direction should be made, a roller stretching apparatus is generally used, and when stretching in a transverse direction should be made, a tenter stretching apparatus or a pulley stretching apparatus are suitable, and more specifically, a stretching apparatus as disclosed in Japanese Publication of Examined Application No. 36948/91 of the present Applicant et al. may here be cited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Although the stretching and heating of a web are separately conducted in the above-describe example, these might be conducted simultaneously so that the web is extended while it is being heated. However, since extending of the thermoplastic elastomer occurs uniformly when it is extended at room temperature or at a given low temperature while being heated, it is preferable to conduct the stretching process and the heating process separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Bonding a extensible nonwoven fabric with a web will be most simply achieved by either a heat-pressing method using heat rollers or a heat-emboss bonding method. Further, if the use of the elastic composite sheet requires, bonding by adhesive such as hot-melt adhesive, ultrasonic bonding, or high-frequency bonding might be employed. Furthermore, a physical bonding method such as a needle punch and a water jetting may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The web including thermoplastic elastomer might not necessarily be extended if it were able to satisfy the performances that the elastic composite sheet requires. For example, elastic composite sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is constituted by bonding film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> including a thermoplastic elastomer with an extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to which extensibility in a longitudinal direction is given. Openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed in film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> during the film-forming stage, and film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> under melt condition is bonded with extensible nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The Web, which is bonded with extensible nonwoven fabric, might be a nonwoven fabric or a net other than the above-mentioned film so far as it were made of thermoplastic elastomer, and might further be either a knitted web or woven fabric of thermoplastic elastomer yarns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> For example, when nonwoven fabric is used as the web, thermoplastic elastomer is spun to obtain fibers in a nonwoven fabric form, and then the thermoplastic elastomer nonwoven fabric is bonded with a extensible nonwoven fabric to manufacture an elastic composite sheet in a manner such that the alignment direction of the elastomer fibers coincides with an elastic direction aimed by the elastic composite sheet. A method of manufacturing a nonwoven fabric of thermoplastic elastomer may be a conventional melt blown method, a conventional spunbonded method, or a spinning method as disclosed in Japanese publications of unexamined application Nos. 242960/90 and 204767/98 of the Present Applicant et al., though not limited to these methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> With an elastic composite sheet made by bonding of a extensible nonwoven fabric with a thermoplastic elastomer nonwoven fabric, since the thermoplastic elastomer nonwoven fabric per se has flexibility due to the fact that the thermoplastic elastomer is formed in fibers, the elastic composite sheet can consequently be of highly flexible and of high quality. Also, the thermoplastic elastomer nonwoven fabric has air permeability, and therefore when it is used for producing a disposable diaper and clothes, the products can be very comfortable without generating any frowsy condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> It is required that the thermoplastic elastomer web has air permeability and moisture permeability. The air permeability and so on are necessary for preventing generation of any frowsy condition when the elastic composite sheet is used for clothes and the like. Nevertheless, in the case of thermoplastic elastomer web acquired by extending a raw web, holes provided for the air permeability purpose and so on might be minute since during the stretching, the holes are expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing, the elastic composite sheet according to the present invention was described with respect to three embodiments thereof. However, the elastic composite sheet according to the present invention can exhibit elasticity even if elongation of at least equal to or more than 100%, preferably of equal to or more than 150%, and most preferably of equal to or more than 200% is given. Further, it is preferable that any residual strain in the elastic composite sheet after repetition of elastic motion is small. More specifically, the residual strain after three times repetition of elastic motion of 200% elongation, should preferably be at least equal to or less than 25%, more preferably be equal to or less than 15%, and most preferably be equal to or less than 10%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The elastic composite sheet according to the present invention may be adapted for various fields in clothes and medical care, including an elastic bandage, a supporter, a cloth&apos;s cuff, an elastic tape, a stretch belt, a strap of brassieres, a belly band, a maternity band, a fray stopper for a pair of gloves or socks, elastic and resilient elements for sanitary materials such as a disposable diaper and an incontinence pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, an elastic composite sheet capable of effectively exhibiting elasticity with the use of a small amount of elastomer can be manufactured by a simple and effective forming method. Thus, the elastic composite sheet according to the present invention is excellent in its capability of mass production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a more specific description of several embodiments of the present invention will be provided. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Pleats were formed in a commercially available polypropylene nonwoven fabric (basis weight is 30 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) in a longitudinal direction at a pitch of 0.8 mm by the employment of the apparatus illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and the fabric is subsequently subjected to heat treatment at 130&deg; C. to form a extensible nonwoven fabric with basis weight of 65 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and having extensibility given thereto in a longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> During the conveying process of this extensible nonwoven fabric, as thermoplastic elastomer, SEBS (styrene-ethylenebutylene-styrene) polymer (the trade name of &ldquo;Craton G 1657&rdquo; manufactured by Shell Japan Inc.) was extruded from a number of monofilament dies arranged at a pitch of 5 mm so as to form strands of thermoplastic elastomer on the extensible nonwoven fabric. Then, before solidification of the thermoplastic elastomer, the extensible nonwoven fabric was nipped by nip rollers while cooling the thermoplastic elastomer, so that the stretchable nonwoven fabric and the thermoplastic fabric are bonded together. As a result, an elastic composite sheet capable of being elastic in a longitudinal direction was acquired. The fineness of the strands was 500 tex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The acquired elastic composite sheet had elongation of 230% in a longitudinal direction, and even after repeating elastic motion of 200% 5 times, the integrity of the extensible nonwoven fabric and the strands was not damaged, and residual strain was 19%. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Short fibers that is a mixture of 75% of Polyethylene terephthalate short fibers (fineness is 0.25 tex, and length is 50 mm) and 25% of polyesters low-melting short fibers (Trade name &ldquo;MELTY 2080&rdquo; manufactured by Unitika, Ltd.) was employed as a raw material, and was supplied to a carding machine used for spinning. Thus, a carded web with basis weight of 40 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>was acquired. Then, this web was subjected to thermal embossing treatment at a temperature 180&deg; C. to obtain a short-fiber nonwoven fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> An elastic nonwoven fabric having elasticity in a transverse direction was acquired by using this short-fiber nonwoven fabric, and by the employment of the apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Namely, the short-fiber nonwoven fabric was formed therein with pleats at a pitch of 0.8 mm in a transverse direction, and subsequently was subjected to heat treatment at the temperature of 120&deg; C. to form an extensible nonwoven fabric having extensibility given thereto in a transverse direction. This extensible nonwoven fabric was then supplied to an elastomer spinning system while permitting the extensible nonwoven fabric to run along the guide cylinder, so that melt thermoplastic elastomer is spun thereto from the spinning head. Thus, the strands of thermoplastic elastomer were formed in the extensible nonwoven fabric, and an elastic composite sheet capable of being elastic in a transverse direction was acquired. As the thermoplastic elastomer, SEBS (styrene-ethylenebutylene-styrene) polymer (the trade name of &ldquo;Craton G 1657&rdquo; manufactured by Shell Japan Inc.) was employed. The spinning head having an outer diameter of 200 mm, and two nozzles was used, and was rotated at 150 rpm to spin the thermoplastic elastomer. The guide cylinder that was used had an inner diameter of 500 mm. The fineness of the strands was 300 tex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The acquired elastic composite sheet has elongation of 300% in a transverse direction, and even after repeating the elastic motion of 200% 5 times; the integrity of the extensible nonwoven fabric and the strands was not damaged, and residual strain was 15%. </paragraph>
