<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, the IDF file reading means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> obtains the value of each element of the &lsquo;substrate outline&rsquo;, the &lsquo;substrate thickness&rsquo; and the &lsquo;substrate origin&rsquo; based on the specification shown in the chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> for example, from the IDF substrate file <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which has been created as mentioned above and output to the predetermined bus, obtains the value of each element of the &lsquo;component ID&rsquo;, the &lsquo;component arrangement&rsquo;, the &lsquo;component, origin&rsquo;, and a &lsquo;component two-dimensional simple shape&rsquo; based on the specification shown in the chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> for example, from the IDF component file <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which has been created as mentioned above and output to the predetermined bus, and stores the values obtained in the storage region of substrate outline and the like <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Then, the substrate three-dimensional shape creation/synthesis means <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, based on the values stored in the storage region of substrate outline and the like <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, creates and synthesizes the printed board three-dimensional simple shape data showing the three-dimensional simple shape of the printed board as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> for example, in which the electronic component shape is expressed as the rectangular parallelepiped-like shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Note that the printed board three-dimensional simple shape data created and synthesized by the substrate three-dimensional shape creation/synthesis means <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is stored in the substrate three-dimensional simple shape storage region <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the external design database retrieval means <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> uses the component ID obtained by the IDF file reading means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as a key, and if the external design database <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is an RDB mode, it obtains its corresponding record ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> And, in the block configuration view shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the external design database <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is the RDB mode, and the case is shown where the external design database retrieval means <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> obtains the record ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Note that, if the external design database <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a substance file management mode such as a file server, the external design database retrieval means <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> obtains a corresponding full path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the component three-dimensional shape reading means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> reads the electronic component three-dimensional detail shape data showing the three-dimensional detail shape of the electronic component as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> for example, where the electronic component shape is expressed as a life shape, from the component three-dimensional detail shape library <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is related with the record ID obtained by the external design database retrieval means <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and stores the electronic component three-dimensional detail shape data read in the component three-dimensional detail shape storage region <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Then, the component three-dimensional shape substitute means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> reads the electronic component three-dimensional detail shape data stored in the component three-dimensional detail shape storage region <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> based on the arrangement information of each electronic component that the printed board three-dimensional simple shape data stored in the substrate three-dimensional simple shape storage region <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> shows, and synthesizes the detail shape of electronic component using the concerned electronic component three-dimensional detail shape data, substitutes the simple shape of electronic component for the detail shape of the concerned electronic component substituted, and creates the three-dimensional shape of the printed board as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is one that, regarding the wiring pattern shape and the via/land shape stored in the wiring pattern shape/via-land shape storage region <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, inputs thickness information of the wiring pattern to the wiring pattern shape and inputs thickness information of the substrate to the via/land shape, creates the wiring pattern shape and the via/land shape as three-dimensional shape information, re-synthesizes the substrate origin as arrangement information with the above-mentioned printed board three-dimensional detail shape, and completes the three-dimensional detail shape of the printed board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Then, the printed board three-dimensional detail shape data showing the three-dimensional detail shape of the printed board, which has been created as mentioned above by the component three-dimensional shape substitute means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, is stored in a substrate three-dimensional detail shape storage region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Therefore, since the printed board three-dimensional detail shape data stored in the substrate three-dimensional detail shape storage region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is one that expresses the three-dimensional shape of the printed board in detail, it can be fully used as simulation data such as highly precise fitting check and strength analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Further, according to this system, since each designer does not need to perform data editing of the three-dimensional data of the printed board obtained by the IDF format with manual operation, labor can be significantly reduced and the processing time can be sharply shortened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Note that the above-mentioned embodiments may be modified into (1) to (3) shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (1) In the above-mentioned embodiments, although description has been made for the case where the IDF format was used as data format, it is not limited to this, of course, and any format can be used as the data format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> (2) In the above-mentioned embodiments, although the printed board three-dimensional simple shape data has been created in this system, it is not limited to this, of course, and an interface function that can enter the printed board three-dimensional simple shape data created in an external system is provided, and the printed board three-dimensional detail shape data may be created using the printed board three-dimensional simple shape data created in the external system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> (3) The above-mentioned embodiments and modification examples shown in the above-mentioned (1) to (2) may be appropriately combined. </paragraph>
