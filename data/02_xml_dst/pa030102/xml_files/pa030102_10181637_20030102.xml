<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This invention will be described in further detail by way of examples with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an electronic configuration of a portable telephone K in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> designates a central processing unit (CPU) that performs overall controls on several sections and circuits of the portable telephone K, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> designates a read-only memory (ROM) that stores programs executed by the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as well as incoming call melody data used for generation of incoming call melody sound to notify a user of the portable telephone K of reception of incoming calls from calling parties. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> designates a random-access memory (RAM) that is used as a temporary storage of data. The RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> temporarily stores telephone numbers for use in dial processing and music data used for playing games. Incidentally, the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a battery-backup. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> designates an operator input section that contains numeric keys for use in entry of telephone numbers and function keys for inputting commands and instructions. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> designates a display that is constituted by a liquid crystal display and a display control circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> designates a communicator connected with an antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The communicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> transmits transmission data on carrier waves by the antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and it also demodulates incoming call signals received by the antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to produce incoming call data, which are forwarded to a speech processor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In addition, a microphone <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> picks up and converts the speech of the user of the portable telephone K to speech signals, which are forwarded to the speech processor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The speech processor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> converts speech signals to digital data, which are then compressed to form transmission data to be supplied to the communicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Further, the speech of a person who uses a telephone terminal (not shown) to communicate with the portable telephone K is received and converted to speech data by the communicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the speech processor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> converts the speech data output from the communicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to analog speech signals, which are forwarded to a speaker <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> designates a musical tone memory to which music data given from the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is to be written. That is, the musical tone memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> stores incoming call melody data used for generation of incoming call melody sound and music data used for playing games, details of which will be described later. A controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> writes the music data given from the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the musical tone memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Herein, the music data contain melody data, timing data and rhythm sound data. Thus, the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> reads the melody data from the musical tone memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to sequentially output them to a sound source circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in accordance with the timing data. In addition, the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generates pulse signals for designating timings of generating rhythm sounds and outputs them to a rhythm sound source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in accordance with the rhythm sound data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The sound source circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is a circuitry that forms digital musical tone signals based on the FM system or PCM system. That is, the sound source circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> forms digital melody sound signals based on the melody data output from the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, so that the digital melody sound signals are forwarded to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The digital-to-analog converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> converts the digital melody sound signals output from the sound source circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to analog melody sound signals, which are forwarded to a mixer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The rhythm sound source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates digital rhythm sound signals based on the pulse signals output from the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, so that the digital rhythm sound signals are forwarded to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The digital-to-analog converter <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> converts the digital rhythm sound signals output from the rhythm sound source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to analog rhythm sound signals, which are forwarded to the mixer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The mixer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> mixes together the analog melody sound signals and analog rhythm sound signals that are respectively output from the digital-to-analog converters <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Thus, the mixer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> produces mixed signals, which are forwarded to a speaker <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> designates a vibration sensor that senses swinging vibration applied to the portable telephone K by the user. When an output of the vibration sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> exceeds a prescribed threshold level, a vibration detection circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> generates a pulse, which is forwarded to a rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. That is, as long as the output of the vibration sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> exceeds the prescribed threshold level, the vibration detection circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> outputs pulse signals, which are forwarded to the rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The user starts a game by pressing a certain key on the operator input section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> issues a game start signal, which activates the rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to operate. That is, after the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> issues the game start signal, the rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> measures time differences between pulses output from the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which designate timings of generating rhythm sounds, and pulses output from the vibration detection circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which detects the swinging vibration of the portable telephone K. Then, the measured time differences are forwarded to the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Next, descriptions will be given with respect to detailed operations of the portable telephone K that provides game device functions in addition to portable telephone functions. First, a description will be given with respect to the portable telephone functions of the portable telephone K. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At reception of an incoming call from a telephone terminal of a calling party, the communicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> receives incoming call signals by the antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, wherein the incoming call signals are demodulated to produce incoming call data, which are forwarded to the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Upon receipt of the incoming call data, the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> accesses the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to store a telephone number of the calling party. Then, the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reads from the ROM <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> the incoming call melody data, which are forwarded to the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> writes the incoming call melody data to the musical tone memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, from which the incoming call melody data are sequentially read out and supplied to the sound source circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Thus, the sound source circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generates incoming call melody signals, which are converted to analog signals by the digital-to-analog converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The analog signals are supplied to the speaker <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by way of the mixer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so that the speaker <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> produces incoming call melody sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When hearing the incoming call melody sound, the user of the portable telephone K presses a call reception button (not shown) on the operator input section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, so that the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> issues an incoming call sound stop instruction to the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In addition, the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> issues a line connection instruction to the speech processor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and communicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, a line connection is established between the portable telephone K and the telephone terminal of the calling party. This enables transmission of speech signals of the microphone <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the calling party. In addition, the speech processor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> outputs speech signals based on the speech of the calling party to the speaker <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, the speaker <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> produces the speech of the calling party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a call transmission mode, the user of the portable telephone K operates the numeric keys on the operator input section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to enter a telephone number of a called party, then, the user presses a call transmission button (not shown) on the operator input section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. By the entry of the telephone number using the numeric keys, the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> writes the telephone number to the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When the user presses the call transmission button, the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sends the telephone number temporarily stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the communicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Then, the communicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> transmits signals representing the telephone number on carrier waves by the antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Hence, call signals corresponding the telephone number are sent to the telephone terminal of the called party. When a line connection is established with the telephone terminal of the called party, the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> issues a line connection instruction to the communicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the speech processor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This secures conversation with the called party by the microphone <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and speaker <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned portable telephone functions are generally employed by the conventional portable telephones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be given with respect to the game device functions of the portable telephone K. In this case, the user calls a music download center (not shown) over phone to request distribution (or download) of musical tunes. The music download center corresponds to computer facilities that are provided for exclusive use in distribution of music information and data. When receiving requests from users or subscribers of telephones via telephone lines, the music download center distributes music data of requested musical tunes on charges. That is, the music download center distributes to the users or subscribers the music data containing melody sound data and rhythm sound data. When the user of the portable telephone K requests a certain musical tune for distribution, the music download center downloads corresponding music data to the portable telephone K, in which the music data are received by the communicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and are forwarded to the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> writes the downloaded music data to the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Herein, the user of the portable telephone K is capable of requesting distribution of multiple musical tunes from the music download center, so that the multiple musical tunes are written to the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the portable telephone K receives downloaded music data of multiple musical tunes as requested, the user is capable of selecting one of the musical tunes by operating a prescribed key (or keys) on the operator input section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> detects key operations made by the user to read out music data of the selected musical tune from the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The read music data are forwarded to the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, by which they are written to the musical tone memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Then, the user operates a prescribed key to start a game on the operator input section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> detects such a key operation to issue a game start instruction to the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Thus, the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sequentially reads from the musical tone memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> the music data that contain melody data, timing data and rhythm sound data. The controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> outputs the melody data to the sound source circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in accordance with the timing data, while it also outputs pulse signals designating timings of generating rhythm sounds to the rhythm sound source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in accordance with the rhythm sound data. Thus, the speaker <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> produces melody sound and rhythm sound of the selected musical tune. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In synchronization with the musical tune, the user holds and swings the portable telephone K like a maraca, which is a kind of a percussion instrument. When the user swings the portable telephone K, swinging vibration is applied to the portable telephone K and is sensed by the vibration sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that output pulses. That is, the vibration detection circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> outputs pulse signals corresponding to outputs of the vibration sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Hence, the rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> inputs pulses output from the vibration detection circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for detecting the swinging vibration and pulses output from the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for designating timings of generating rhythm sounds. As long as the user continuously swings the portable telephone K intensely over the prescribed threshold level, the rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> successively detects time differences between the aforementioned pulses. As a result, the rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> produces time difference data in connection with the output pulses of the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> respectively, so that the time difference data are successively forwarded to the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sequentially writes the time difference data to the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When the portable telephone K completes playback of the musical tune based on the music data written in the musical tone memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> issues an interrupt signal representing an end of playback to the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Upon receipt of the interrupt signal, the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sums up the time difference data written to the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, a total of the time difference data is displayed on the screen of the display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as a user&apos;s score in playing a music game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned embodiment, the portable telephone K is designed to generate rhythm pulses based on rhythm data contained in music data. It is possible to modify the present embodiment such that rhythm pulses be extracted from the melody sound data. In addition, it is possible to modify the present embodiment such that generation of rhythm sounds be stopped during a game play. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which shows an electronic configuration of a portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, parts identical to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are designated by the same reference numerals, hence, the description thereof will be omitted as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> differs from the portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by the provision of a vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a diode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which substitute for the aforementioned vibration sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and vibration detection circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, the portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is also equipped with a battery <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a power source circuit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which are also used by the portable telephone K of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> wherein those elements are omitted from the illustration. The vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is a dc motor in which a vibrating member is fixed to a rotation shaft in an unbalanced manner. When the vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> operates to rotate the rotation shaft, the vibrating member is subjected to unbalanced motion to cause vibration. The diode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is provided to prevent reverse current from flowing therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the user is capable of operating some key on the operator input section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to select vibration caused by the vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> instead of generation of incoming call melody sound. In that case, at reception of an incoming call, the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> issues a drive instruction to the vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Thus, the portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> activates the vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to cause vibration without generating incoming call melody sound in response to reception of an incoming call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be given with respect to game device functions of the portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, the user cuts off power supply to the vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Similar to the portable telephone K shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> performs similar processing so that the speaker <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> produces musical tones of a specific musical tune being selected. When the user swings and vibrates the portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in synchronization with the musical tones of the specific musical tune, the rotation shaft of the vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is forced to rotate due to vibration of the portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Due to the forced rotation of the rotation shaft, &lsquo;pulse-like&rsquo; counter-electromotive force is caused to occur on a coil of the vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The counter-electromotive force is supplied to the rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Then, the rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> detects time differences between the pulses of counter-electromotive force and the rhythm pulses output from the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The rhythm difference detection circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> produces time difference data, which are forwarded to the CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, the portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is characterized by using the vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> instead of the vibration sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned counter-electromotive force is supplied to the battery <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via the diode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, so that the battery <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will be charged. This means that the portable telephone K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> uses the vibration motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as a vibration source as well as an electricity generating source that charges the battery <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> while the user enjoys playing a music game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As described heretofore, this invention has a variety of effects and technical features, which are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> (1) The portable telephone of this invention is designed to detect time differences between rhythm pulses corresponding to a rhythm of a musical tune and pulses that are produced by the user who swings and vibrates the portable telephone in synchronization with musical tones of the musical tune. In addition, the portable telephone introduces a brand-new function to automatically mark a score in a music game on the basis of the time differences between the rhythm pulses and the pulses produced in response to user&apos;s motion. Thus, it is expected that the portable telephones providing the aforementioned function may attract interests of people to arouse new demands on the market of portable telephones and game devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> (2) Detecting vibration on the portable telephone is not only realized by a vibration sensor but also realized by a vibration motor. The vibration motor is used to cause vibration in response to reception of incoming calls from calling parties. In addition, the vibration motor can be also used as a sensor because it produces counter-electromotive force in response to vibration applied thereto. Further, the counter-electromotive force can be used to charge a battery. Thus, portable telephones that provide vibration motors to realize game device functions of this invention can be easily manufactured without providing new capital investment in the existing phone manufacturing facilities. This may bring reduction in manufacturing costs for producing new portable telephones having game device functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Lastly, this invention is not necessarily limited to the foregoing embodiments, hence, it is possible to provide any types of modifications within the scope of the invention without departing from essential subject matters. </paragraph>
