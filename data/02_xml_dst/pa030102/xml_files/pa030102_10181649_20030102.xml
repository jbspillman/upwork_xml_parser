<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention concerns a cash dispenser, including a housing with a receiving space for at least one bank note storage unit, a dispensing mechanism associated with the storage unit for removing individual bank notes from the storage unit, a bank note transport mechanism for transporting the bank notes between the storage unit and a control panel of the cash dispenser, a power supply unit and a control mechanism for controlling the functions of the cash dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There exist up to now no methods for positively securing cash from undesired access during the circulation of cash in commerce and banks. Security problems always appear at the interfaces, when for example cash must be removed from the safe system or must be resupplied to the cash dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Usually in cash dispensing/depositing machines, bank note containers or cassettes are used, which have to be filled or emptied in central loading or filling stations. For the stationary securing of cash at cash handling places and cash dispensers, strong boxes are used in which the bank note containers are placed. The transport of the bank note cassettes is carried out mostly through the use of valuables transport service performers. For this today, by regulation, professional associations in Germany are required to have an armored vehicle with three employees. The situation in other countries is analogous. Customarily one employee must watch the armored vehicle while the two others undertake a cassette exchange or refill cash on the spot. This high consumption of personnel and material is necessary to defend against attacks or to prevent manipulation by the cash deliverers themselves (&ldquo;the four-eye principal&rdquo;). Very high costs are connected with this type of cash security. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention has as its basic object the provision of a cash dispenser of the aforementioned kind which makes possible a gapless security of the cash circulation between the cash dispensers and the associated bank with low personnel and material expense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This object is solved in accordance with the invention by a closable and lockable box shaped container containing at least one bank note storage unit, a first bank note conveyor which connects a withdrawal device with a pass-through slot in the container wall, a drive for the withdrawal device and for the first bank note conveyor, a first control unit for controlling the functional units enclosed in the container, and a security mechanism which upon unauthorized manipulation of the container makes the bank notes contained in it unusable, the receiving space of the housing of the cash dispenser for receiving the container being so formed that the housing contains a second bank note conveyor for connecting the pass-through slot of the container with the control panel as well as a second control unit for controlling the functional units connected to the housing, and the container having an interface connected with the drive and the first control unit in the container for connection of the same to the second control unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the solution according to the invention, the container because of the security mechanism contained in it replaces the previously required strong box, the transport security trunk and the armored vehicle, and makes possible a gapless security process as well as a new concept in the construction of cash dispensers. The container forms a mobile strong box which as an encapsulated, closed unit can be quickly and securely connected with the stationary portion of the cash dispenser. Since the container because of the security mechanism contained in it need not be armored it can be handled by a single person. An armored vehicle is likewise not needed. Accordingly, this reduces the above-described expense and associated costs drastically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> EP 0 692 599 BI already describes indeed a system for the protected transport of articles such as checks, bank notes and the like with a security system containing container, which can be loaded into or removed from a docking station. The docking station has, in this case, however, only the function and opening and locking of the container without tripping into action the self-destruction mechanism. A removal of bank notes from the container without opening the same is neither mentioned nor are the there described means suited to making possible a use of the container in a cash dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Essential to the classification of the container as a mobile strong box is the fact that the single opening in the strong box wall is a pass-through slot for bank notes. All functional units which are necessary for pushing the withdrawn bank notes through the pass-through slot are arranged inside of the container. Along with the pass-through slot only through openings are required for conductors which connect the interface with the functional units inside of the container. Therefore, the interface for connecting the functional units contained by the container to the power supply unit of the cash dispenser can be so formed that the control conductors and the power supply conductors have to be guided through the container wall. The remainder of the container, however, is entirely closed. Either a bank note conveyor or a drive element (for example, a power take off shaft), must be inserted into the container from its outside. This entails a further opening in the upper surface of the container which cannot be sufficiently secured against manipulation. To prevent a control of the functional elements by a non-authorized person through the control conductors, it is advantageous if the communication between the first control unit of the container and the second control unit in the stationary portion of the cash dispenser is coded. In this way it is assured that the container can be emptied only by the cash dispenser with which it is associated. In the case of theft of the container, there exists no possibility of emptying it, without forceable opening, by the help of reconstructing the cash dispenser or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The concept of a cash dispenser according to the invention makes it possible to on one hand design the container to be robust and compact and on the other hand to also be of light weight, so that it can be transported by one man. Since during the transport of the container large stretches and also height differences must be traversed it is advantageous if the container is connected with wheels so that it need not be carried all the time by the transport person. Advantageously, the container is arranged on an undercarriage and is adjustable relative to the undercarriage between a lower transport position and a lifted position, in which lifted position it is insertable into the receiving space of the cash dispenser. The undercarriage can be made somewhat like a sack carrier on which the container is adjustably guided. To more easily lift the container, the undercarriage can have arranged on it a lifting mechanism, such as for example, a gas spring or the like, which upon the opening of a latch lifts the container on the undercarriage or at least assists in such a lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the receiving space of the cash dispenser are advantageously provided guide elements intended to cooperate with complementary elements on the container, or on the undercarriage, which make possible an exact positioning of the container as well as especially an exact positioning of the interface relative to the corresponding connection station of the cash dispenser. Insofar as the container may be provided with a grip, the grip can be arranged pivotally or removably on the container so that it does not interfere with the closing of the receiving space. To be able to respectively supply or withdraw bank notes into and from the storage unit or storage units in the container, the container includes, in a way known in itself, a container body and a lid movable relative to the container body which is lockable relative to the container body by a lock, which lock is advantageously contact freely actuatable, to more easily distinguish between a permitted actuation of the lock and a mechanical manipulation attempt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The container body and the lid can, for example, as is known in the case of cash trunks, be made of glass fiber reinforced plastic in which a very fine wire mesh is embedded. Damage to this wire mesh triggers the security mechanism, for example, an explosive mechanism by means of which a coloring material is dispersed into the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> If the container includes several storage units for the reception of different types of bank notes, it is advantageous to associate with each storage unit its own withdrawal mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The security mechanism is advantageously contact freely actuatable and deactuatable and is also preferably triggerable by a remote control. The latter case is important if the bank note container in its entirety falls into unintended hands and one wishes to make its contents unusable before anyone really has the chance, by manipulation of the container, to gain access to its contents. In connection with this the container can, in a way known in itself, be provided with a location transmitter so that it, for example, can be found by way of a satellite positioning system and/or can be controlled as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The security of the container is increased if the security mechanism is activated after its filling in a bank note filling station and remains uninterruptedly activated, and is also non-deactivatable, during its transport to and its movement into an out of the cash dispenser, as well as during its reverse transport to the bank note filling station, and can only be deactivated in the bank note filling station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Alternatively to this, activation and deactivation of the security mechanism can also be accomplished by way of the control unit of the cash dispenser, with which it is associated, so that definite procedures can be used which in turn are securely stored in the data processing apparatus of the cash dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the drive of the bank note conveyors located both in the container as well as in the cash dispenser are reversible with the storage unit in the container being designed for the dispensing and receipt of individual bank notes. If the storage unit is further associated with a mechanism for the ordered input of bank notes to the storage unit, the cash dispenser of the invention can be used for the dispensing and depositing of bank notes. Further, the container can also be automatically loaded and unloaded at a docking station without it having to be opened. This increases the security against dishonorable employees of the bank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The storage unit can be formed to receive a stack of bank notes, with the withdrawal mechanism being formed, as is in itself well known, as a withdrawal and individualizing mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, at least one of the storage units is formed as a winding store, having at least one storage band, which band is wound from a supply roll over a deflecting roll arranged near the pass-through opening to a winding core, and vis-a-vis windable from the winding core, with the winding core and the supply roll being drivable by a winding drive. A winding store has the advantage that no individualizing mechanism is necessary for the withdrawal and individualizing of the bank notes, since the bank notes lie individually between the band layers of the winding store. At the same time, the danger of a plural dispensing is avoided so that also a corresponding control mechanism for testing for plural withdrawal can be eliminated. Finally the use of a winding store has the advantage that bank notes without great expense cannot only be removed from the storage unit, but can also be inserted into it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the winding store, the winding core has two spools which are arranged axis parallel at a spacing from one another and of which at least one is coupable with the winding drive, with the storage band passing around both spools in common on their circumferential areas which face away from one another. The winding core is therefore not cylindrical, but has the form of a flattened elongated oval so that the winding store formed by such a winding core can optimally fill a customary rectangularly shaped housing intended for receiving a bank note stack. This simplifies the combination of the winding store with storage units of other types of construction, and their common space saving accommodation in the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The previously described winding store has, in comparison to customary winding stores, the advantage that the bank notes stored in the winding store are not constantly bent, but are also stored on the straight sections between the two spools. If bank notes become wound for long times on one of the spools, they obtain a retained curvature which is injurious to their being handled in a cash dispenser. To avoid this curvature in the winding store of the invention, the winding store can, for example, be constantly moved several steps forwardly or rearwardly so as to move bank notes from the curved portions of the winding to the straight portions and back again and thereby to avoid a permanent curvature of the stored bank notes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is sufficient that one end of the storage band be fastened to one of the two spools and that the band passes at least once around the winding core, before the delivery of bank notes is begun. The winding core can, however, also be so formed that the two spools are surrounded by one endless band which forms the circumferential envelope of the winding core, onto which endless band the storage band is windable. This is at least advantageous if the storage band is of only one layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The storage band can, however, include two individual foils which are unwound as a double layer from the supply roll and which are guided to the output station of the storage unit by way of separated paths, whereby they after forming a bank note input/output gap they are again guided together as a double layer by a deflecting roll and are wound onto the winding core. In this solution the bank notes are not stored between the windings and the storage band running onto the winding, but are stored between the two individual foils of the storage band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The container can in addition to the at least one bank note storage unit for the dispensing of bank notes also contain a collection compartment for bank notes to be taken back. One such collection or reject compartment serves to receive bank notes which indeed have been offered to the customer but not removed by the customer. Or the bank notes indeed may have been made ready for dispensing and then, however, because of an interruption in a transaction or because of some fault are not dispensed to the customer. These bank notes are, because of bookkeeping grounds, usually not again placed in the storage unit for the bank notes to be dispensed, but are instead deposited in such a collection compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In customary cash dispensers the bank notes to be dispensed and also the collection compartment are customarily formed as secure cassettes. In the solution of the invention, this is no longer necessary. The storage unit and/or the collection compartment can be formed as simple drawers slidable into the container, with the storage unit having to be provided with only a pressing mechanism and a drive. Many of the previously customary cassette functional elements, which were required for the realization of a clean interface between the bank note cassettes and the individualizing units are no longer necessary in the case of the solution of the invention, such as, for example, flaps for the closing of the cassette openings, rearward pull bows, anti-repeat devices, control links, locks and the like. Therefore, the construction, material and financial expense for such bank note storage unit is substantially lowered. The drawers are, for example, guided on rails of a frame which is surrounded by the container walls, so that the guiding for the drawers need not be directly fastened to the container walls. The drawers can for exact positioning of the withdrawal mechanism have an arresting device and are preferably adjustable to accommodate different widths of bank notes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The security mechanism can be so implemented that a bank note coloring or destroying unit is arranged above each of the drawers so that the bank notes in all storage units can be reached by the coloring or destroying mechanism and no dead angle for the effect of the security mechanism exists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In most past dispensers the individual bank notes withdrawn from the bank note cassettes are subsequently assembled into a bundle which is offered to the customer in the output compartment of the control panel. The assembling mechanism, in which the individual bank notes are assembled into a bundle can be arranged at different locations of the transport path. Basically, there exists the possibility to place this assembly station in the container. In this case, the pass-through slot must be somewhat wider to permit the passage therethrough of a bundle of bank notes. To increase the security it is, however, advantageous if the pass-through slot remains as small as possible. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the assembly station is in the path of the second bank note conveyor, that is, it is arranged in the stationary portion of the cash dispenser. For the case that the bank notes must be again returned and transported to the collection compartment, either the bank notes of the bundle must again be individualized, so that the individual bank notes can be transported back to the collection compartment through the pass-through slot of the container, or the entire bundle is transported to the collection compartment. In this case, there naturally likewise appears the same problem as with the output of a bank note bundle, that is, that the pass-through slot must be of a corresponding width to allow passage of the bundle. Additionally, there arises also the difficulty that the relative stiff bank note bundle has to be deflected by a deflector with a relatively small radius to the collection compartment. On one hand, one desires therefore to do without an individualizing mechanism for individualizing the bank notes of the bundle to be taken back. On the other hand, however, the pass-through slot should be as small as possible and the bundle should be bendable about a small radius. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> This problem is solved in accordance with the invention in that the second bank note conveyor has a first transport stretch with two belt drives the endless belts of which are directed parallel to one another and are driven by a drive roll in the same direction, and between which belts a bank note bundle is grasped and transported, as well as a drive mechanism for driving each belt drive and in that the belt drives at least in the direction from the control panel to the collection compartment are drivable at different speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the way proposed by the invention, the two belt drives which cooperate for the transport of the bank note bundle are driven at different speeds so that the bank note bundle is fanned. During the transport of the bank notes to the output compartment of the control panel, the two belt drives run at exactly the same speed so as to offer the bank notes to the customer in the output compartment with their edges arranged orderly into a bundle, and during the rear transport the bundle is fanned, whereby it becomes thinner and essentially more flexible and allows itself to be bent without problem about relatively small radii. Over a given length, the fanning can be increased as wished by multiple back and forth movement of the bundles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A differential drive speed of the two belt drives can be accomplished in that the drive mechanism for each belt drive has its own individual motor, with at least one of the motors being controllable as to its speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The drive mechanism can, however, also as previously be effected with one motor with one of the two belt drives in one transport direction being coupable with the motor through a first drive train and in the other transport direction being coupable with the motor through a second drive train, with the second drive train having a different drive ratio in comparison to the first drive train. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In a practical embodiment of this solution, the drive roll of the first belt drive and an intermediate shaft parallel to it are rotationally fixedly coupled with the motor, while the drive roll of the second belt drive is connected with the first drive roll by a first one-way coupling and by way of a second one-way coupling, whose effective direction is opposite to that of the first one-way coupling, with the intermediate shaft standing in rotational moment transmitting connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The one-way couplings can be implemented in different ways. For example, one of the one-way couplings can be a latch-free running one or a clamping body-free running one and the other one-way coupling can be a slip coupling which in one direction makes possible a rotational moment transmission and in the other direction avoids a locking of the drive if two drive elements with different rotational speed meet with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The taking up of the speed difference by a slip coupling, however, naturally loads the drive motor. If this is undesirable, the one-way couplings can also be wrap spring couplings made to have opposite effective directions with respect to one another. The wrap spring couplings tighten themselves onto the shaft, on which they are located, in the associated rotational direction, or wind themselves from the shaft to terminate the rotational moment transmission. The control of the wrap springs as a rule is achieved by means of a slide coupling with low rotational moment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The first transport stretch can be coupled in a simple way with a subsequent two belt drive containing transport stretch, with each endless belt of the one belt drive being guided over the first drive roll and the endless belt of the second belt drive being guided over one drive roll which is located on the intermediate shaft. Since the first drive roll and the intermediate shaft are constantly driven at the same rotational speed, the two belt drives of this second transport stretch also run at the same speed, so that the bank note bundles on this second transport stretch are always transported in the form in which they arrive at the second transport stretch, that is either with the bank notes having uniformly arranged edges or with the bank notes in fan form. The second transport stretch can connect the first transport stretch with the assembly station or with the pass-through slot. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The cash dispenser illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a housing, indicated generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with a box like lower portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which forms a receiving space <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for a mobile strong box <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and which is closable by a door <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a housing upper portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> above the housing lower portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are housed the necessary stationary functional units of the cash dispenser for the dispensing and the depositing of bank notes, which units will be described hereinafter so far as necessary. At the forward side of the upper portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a control panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with various schematically indicated control elements <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a display screen <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and an output compartment <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The control panel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can obviously have still further elements such as, for example, a compartment for the insertion of bank notes, a slot for the insertion of an identification card, and the like. These elements for the present invention play no role and are therefore not explained in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The mobile strong box <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a box shaped container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with a container body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a flap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is connected to the container body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement about an axis <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and which is lockable by a lock <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is arranged on an undercarriage indicated, generally at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, having a horizontal frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with forward wheels <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and rear wheels <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, as well as a vertical frame <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extending upwardly from the rear wheels <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on which the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is guided for upward and downward adjustment in the direction of the double arrow A, so that the container is adjustable between a non-illustrated first position, in which it is lowered on the horizontal frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the upper position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The upward movement of the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be assisted by a gas spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which on one side is connected to the horizontal frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and on the other side is connected to the outer side of the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. At the upper end of the vertical frame <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is a bowed grip <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which is arranged pivotally or removably on the vertical frame <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, so that after the insertion of the mobile strong box <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the receiving space <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> it can be folded downwardly or removed so as to not interfere with the closing of the door <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. On the undercarriage <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be transported like a sack truck by a person. So that during transport over steps or during lowering over loading board walls the frame is not damaged, a strengthening plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is arranged at the lower portion of the vertical frame <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> between the rear wheels <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Guide rails <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are arranged in the receiving space <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the bottom of the housing lower portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for guiding the undercarriage <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Likewise, guide rails <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are provided on the cover surface of the housing under portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, into which strips <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> provided on the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are received, in order to so guide the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> during its insertion into the receiving space <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that it will arrive exactly at the prescribed position inside of the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, at which it is arrested by non-illustrated latching means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> On the outer side of the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is arranged a connector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having terminals for the electric current supply and for the transmission of control signals and for contacting a non-illustrated complementary connector provided in the receiving space <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is connected by power and control conductors with functional units inside of the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and connects these functional units through the complementary connector in the receiving space <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with functional units in the stationary portion of the cash dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment contains two storage units <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for bank notes to be dispensed as well as a collecting container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for bank notes which had been prepared for a dispensing process, but for some reason were not handed out to customers. The storage units <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as well as the collection container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, generally called a rejection cassette, are formed as drawers and are guided on guide rails <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> so as to be shiftable in the direction of the double arrows B, so that they can be pulled out of the container body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The two storage units <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> each serve for receiving a stack <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of bank notes, the forward end of which stack in the case of an entirely inserted drawer borders on a withdrawal and individualizing mechanism <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> by means of which, in a way known in an of itself, individual bank notes can be withdrawn from the stack <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The individualizing mechanism <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> stand in connection with a vertical transport <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which connects the individualizing mechanism with a pass-through slot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in the cover surface of the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The vertical transport <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is reversible in its transport direction and includes a deflector <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by means which the bank notes which are inserted into the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the pass-through slot can be delivered to the rejection cassette <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the drawer of each storage unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is arranged a pressure slide <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which presses on the bank note stack <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in the direction toward the withdrawal and individualizing mechanism <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The movement of the pressing slide <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is achieved by a motor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> arranged on the slide, the drive pinion of which meshes with a rack <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> fastened to the drawer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Above each storage unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and also above the reject cassette <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> there is included, at one of the guide rails <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, but arranged on an otherwise non-illustrated frame inside of the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a bank note coloring unit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> which has an ink or coloring material container <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> from which ink can be sprayed over the entire contents of the container by means of an explosion unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The explosion unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is triggered by a triggering unit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The triggering unit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be activated and deactivated and responds in its activated condition to mechanical and electronic manipulation attempts upon the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In connection with this, it is to be understood that all of the outer walls of the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are included in the security mechanism. This can be accomplished by having the container wall made of glass fiber reinforced plastic material, in which a fine wire netting is embedded. This wire netting is so connected with the triggering unit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, that any damage to the wire netting triggers the coloring unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Also located in the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a first control unit <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which controls the drive for the withdrawing and individualizing mechanism <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the vertical transporter <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as well as the deflector <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. This control unit <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is connected through the connector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with a second control unit <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, which is arranged in the upper housing portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the cash dispenser (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the upper portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the housing is also arranged a bank note conveyor <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which connects the pass-through slot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the output compartment <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the control panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cash dispenser. The bank note conveyor <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> includes a collection station <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> with a stacking wheel <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, for stacking the individual bank notes withdrawn from the storage unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> into a bundle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which bundle is then, through an output transport <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, tendered to a customer in the output compartment <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The bank note conveyor <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can also have a further transport stretch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, through which the bank notes which are not removed from the output compartment <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by a customer, after a pregiven time, are transported in the reverse direction and deposited into the reject cassette <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment of the invention the bank notes of the returned bundles are individualized by an individualizing mechanism <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> so that they can be transmitted individually through the pass-through slot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the vertical transport <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which by means of the deflector <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> delivers them to the reject cassette <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In the same way, in principal, deposited bank notes of customers can be delivered to the storage unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in order for them to be deposited in ordered form, that is in stacked form. This can be accomplished either by a suitable non-illustrated mechanism for guiding the bank notes to the storage unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> or by a suitable construction of the individualizing mechanism by a reversal of the transport direction of the individualizing elements. Then moreover the inserted bank notes, in a way known in itself, must pass through a non-destructive testing mechanism which checks the genuineness of the inserted bank notes and their external condition. Bank notes which do not pass this checking are either returned to the customer or are deposited in the reject compartment <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an exemplary embodiment of a storage unit for the storing of bank notes, which is suited for both the dispensing as well as the ordered depositing of bank notes, without special individualizing or input mechanisms being necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The storage unit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> contains a box shaped housing or a drawer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, to the outer side of which is pivotally connected a hand grip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Inside of the drawer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is a winding store <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with a winding core <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and a double layered storage band <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which can be wound from a supply roll <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> onto the winding core <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or from the winding core <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the supply roll <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The winding core <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> includes two spools <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which are arranged with their axes parallel to one another and at a spacing next to one another, so that the storage band running onto the winding core <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> forms a winding which in side view has the shape of a flattened oval. Advantageously, an endless band <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is guided over both of the spools <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which band passes over the circumferential portions of the spool <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which are facing away from one another and forms a closed circumferential surface of the winding core <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> onto which the storage band <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is wound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The storage band <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> consist of two individual bands <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> with the individual band <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> being guided by deflecting rolls <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and with the individual band <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> being guided over deflecting rolls <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, to the winding core <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The deflecting rolls <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> together with the individual bands <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> a roll gap <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> through which bank notes <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can be inserted between the individual bands <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> or from which the bank notes can be withdrawn from the winding store <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The supply roll <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> as well as at least one of the spools <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected or coupable with a reversible drive, which is either arranged in the drawer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> or outside of the drawer itself in the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in which a latter case a corresponding coupling at the outer side of the drawer must be provided to couple the shaft of the supply roll <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the shaft of the involved spool <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with the drive or drives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> For the storage of bank notes <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, they are inserted into the roller gap <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and are grasped by the two individual bands <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and are locked into the bands if these run in the direction of the arrow C from the supply roll <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to the winding core <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, within this case one of the spools <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or both of the spools <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> being driven, while the supply roll <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> freely, or as the case may be in a lightly braked condition, runs along with the spool. For the output of bank notes <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> the individual bands <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> run in the direction of the arrow D from the winding core <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the supply roll <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, so that the stored bank notes between the individual bands <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are individually moved out of the roller gap <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In this case, the supply roll <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is driven, while the spools <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> run along with the supply roll in free or lightly braked condition. To minimize the mechanical requirements of the storage band <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, is it possible and also practical if the spools <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the supply roll <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are constantly driven in common and in synchronism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The previously described storage unit can be made relatively flat so that it can be easily and in spaced saving way be brought into cooperation with other storage units in the above-described container. The special advantage of the previously described storage unit exists in that without special measures bank notes cannot only be dispensed but can also be deposited whereas the depositing of bank notes in customary stacked cassettes is disproportionately more complicated, since the arranged depositing of bank notes in the form of a stack requires special technical measures. A further advantage of the described winding store with an elongated winding core exists in that the sections of the winding core <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> lying between the spools <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> the bank notes lie flatly. In the case of customary winding stores on the other hand, the bank notes are always bent. If they remain for a long time in the winding store, the bank notes retain this bent condition after their removal from the storage unit. Bent bank notes are, however, hard to handle in the automatic transport mechanisms of a cash dispenser or in their formation into bundles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> By way of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, an exemplary embodiment of the output transport <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> will now be described, which transport makes it possible to so reduce the thickness and stiffness of a bank note bundle that the bank notes can be transported through the pass-through slot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as a bundle to the reject cassette. The individualizing mechanism <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can, in this example, be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The output transport <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has a support frame <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> with two frame walls <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> parallel to one another. Between the frame walls <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> are arranged an upper belt drive <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and a lower belt drive <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The upper belt drive <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> includes two endless belts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> each of which runs over a roll <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, rotatably fixed to a drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> supported in the frame walls <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, and over a roll <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, which is freely rotatably supported on a shaft <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> supported in the frame walls <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The lower belt drive <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes two endless belts <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> each of which runs over a roll <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, rotatably fixed to a drive shaft <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> supported in the frame walls <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, and a roll <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> which is freely rotatably supported on a shaft <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> supported in the frame walls <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The lower runs of the endless belts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the upper belt drive <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> cooperate with the upper runs of the endless belts <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the lower belt drive <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, so as to transport bank note bundles, as can be understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. Two further rolls <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> are arranged in rotatably fixed condition on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> coaxially to the rollers <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, over each of which rollers <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and endless belt <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> runs. The two endless belts <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> form a belt drive of the bank note transport stretch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and cooperate with a further belt drive, that is, with two further endless belts <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> each of which runs over an upper deflecting roll <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> which is rotatably fixedly supported on an intermediate shaft <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> supported by the frame walls <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. As one can see from a comparison between <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> on one hand and between <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> on the other hand, the bank notes which are guided between the endless belts <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> can be transferred to the belt drive <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the transfer can occur in the reverse direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> To avoid a sagging of the endless belts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the horizontal output transport, the endless belts <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the lower belt drive <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> run over a support roll or support rolls <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, which likewise are rotated on a shaft <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> supported by the frame walls <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The drive of the belt drives of the output transport <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and of the transport stretch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is achieved by a motor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, arranged at the inner side of the frame wall <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, the drive wheel <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> of which lies at the outer side of the frame wall <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and drives a drive wheel <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> rotatably fixed to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> through a drive belt <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. The end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> which extends outwardly from the frame wall <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and which is opposite from the drive wheel <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> carries a first gear wheel <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>.

The intermediate gear <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> in turn meshes with a second gear <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> rotatably fixedly connected with the intermediate shaft <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and on the other hand with a third gear <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, which by way of a first one-way coupling <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, in the form of a latch free running one, is coupable with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> On one end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> projecting outwardly from the frame wall <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is located a fourth gear wheel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> rotatably fixed to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, which gear <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> through a third intermediate gear wheel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> supported on the frame wall <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> drives a fifth gear <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> which is coupable with the intermediate shaft <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> through a second one-way coupling <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, which is made as a slip coupling. The slip coupling consists of a brake disk <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> rotatably fixed to the intermediate shaft <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, against which brake disk <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> the gear wheel <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which carries a brake layer <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, is pressed by a helical pressure spring <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The previous description shows that the drive shaft <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the lower belt drive <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the intermediate shaft <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> are driven in both rotational directions in common at the rotational speed determined by the motor rotational speed and the drive ratio. The drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the upper belt drive <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, is driven in the one rotational direction in which the latching coupling <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> engages and therefore can convey a rotational moment from the gear wheel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, through the gear wheel <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, the intermediate gear wheels <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, the gear wheel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the one-way coupling <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> comprising drive train. Therefore if between the rotational speed of the intermediate shaft <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and the gear wheel <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> which is driven through the intermediate gear wheel <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> from the gear wheel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> located on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, a difference occurs, this is taken up by the slip coupling <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the opposite rotational direction, in which the one-way coupling <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> does not engage and therefore conveys no rotational moment from the gear wheel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, the drive of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> occurs through the guide train formed by the gear wheel <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, the intermediate gear wheels <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, the gear wheel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the intermediate shaft <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the slip coupling <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the gear wheel <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the intermediate gear wheel <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the gear wheel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For the forward transport illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, whereby a bank note bundle with uniformly oriented bank note edges is to be transported in the direction of the arrow E to the output compartment <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> of the patch dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the endless belts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the upper belt drive <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and the endless belts <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the lower belt drive <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> must run with exactly the same speed. If the bank note bundles on the other hand are to be transported from the output compartment <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in a direction toward the reject cassette <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</cross-reference>, in accordance with the invention the bank note bundle should be so removed from the compartment that the endless belt <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the upper belt drive <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> runs in the direction of the arrow F with a higher speed than the endless belt <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the lower belt drive <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The drive ratios in the second drive train are so chosen that the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the upper belt drive <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> runs with a higher speed than the drive shaft <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the lower belt drive <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. In the first drive train on the other hand the drive ratios are so chosen that the drive shafts <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> rotate at the same speed. The one-way coupling <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is now so constructed that with a rearward moment of the bank note bundle, that is in the moment direction indicated by the arrow F, the free running condition of the one-way coupling <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is effective, so that the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the upper belt drive <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is rotated at the given higher rotational speed of the second drive train. In the forward direction indicated by the arrow E, on the other hand, the one-way coupling <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is effective and provides a rotational moment transferring connection between the drive wheel <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Since the rotational speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> effected through the first drive train is smaller than the rotational speed effected through he second drive train, the drive shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is braked by the one-way coupling <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in the forward movement. The rotational speed difference between the two drive trains is taken up through the slip coupling <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. By way of the belt drives <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> running at different speeds, the individual bank notes of the bank note bundles are pushed relative to one another in the movement direction, that is the bundles are fanned. Therefore, a bundle becomes entirely thinner and more flexible, so that it can be inserted through the pass-through gap <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in the container <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and can more easily be deflected. By changing the drive direction several times, this fanning can be increased so long as the bundle remains entirely within the transport stretch defined between the belt drives <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
