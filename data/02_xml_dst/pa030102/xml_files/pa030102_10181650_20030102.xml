<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a medical analysis device for a three-dimensional image acquired by means of, for example angiography or radiography, which device includes a storage member for storing voxels that together constitute the image, a display device for displaying the image, and a manipulating member for manipulating the imaging voxels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A device of this kind is marketed by applicant and is used, for example in hospitals, for the evaluation of images of patients that have been acquired by means of angiography or radiography. An example of such an application is the evaluation of a blood vessel structure so as to determine whether and to what extent a medical intervention is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One function that is desirable for such a medical evaluation concerns the possibility of determining the volume of the parts of the body examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another function that is desirable for such a medical analysis device concerns the possibility of further analysis of regions of the part of the body of the patient that is involved in the examination, that is, to use the analysis device to exclude, erase or measure such regions from or in images obtained by means of the medical analysis device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another function concerns the possibility of evaluation from different sides of the body part that has been imaged, or the possibility of making cross-sections thereof at angles that can be determined at random. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention aims to facilitate these and other functions of such a medical analysis device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To this end, in accordance with a first aspect of the invention the medical analysis device is characterized in that the manipulating member is arranged for the selective erasure of voxels in a predetermined direction. A selection can thus be performed on the image material obtained, thus enabling the extraction of relevant data therefrom; such an operation is performed completely under the control of a medical expert operating the analysis device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For suitable control and transparency of the operation of the medical analysis device it is desirable that the predetermined direction then extends perpendicularly to the image plane of the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Very accurate detailing and selection of the image material that is desired or not benefit from the fact that the voxels to be erased in the predetermined direction are situated one in the prolongation of the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to optimize the management and control of the image material, the medical analysis device is preferably constructed in such a manner that the voxels to be erased in a predetermined direction are erasable over an adjustable distance. Evidently, when erasure has been carried out too far in a given direction, the erased material can be restored again in au inverse operation, without it being necessary to perform all previously performed manipulations again on the original image material. This benefits in particular the ease of operation and use of the device in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, where the analysis device is provided with a manipulating member that is arranged to adjust the orientation of an imaginary cutting plane that serves to cut through the image formed by the voxels and where the display device is capable of simultaneous display of the cutting plane and at least part of the image formed by the voxels, is characterized in that an imaginary point of origin that is situated in the cutting plane can be allocated to the cutting plane and that this point constitutes a point of rotation for the cutting plane when the orientation of the cutting plane is readjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This facility represents an important improvement over the prior art medical analysis device in which the cutting plane, upon readjustment, moves around a point of origin that is situated at the center of the image relative to the part of the body being examined. This gives rise to unnatural and comparatively complex positioning of the cutting plane in the image and hence of the cross-section through the organ of the patient being examined. The analysis of the part of the body or organ being examined according to prior art is thus seriously hampered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> This problem is eliminated by providing the medical analysis device in accordance with the invention with the facility that has just been introduced. When the point of origin about which the cutting plane can move is positioned such that it is situated in the cutting plane, the movement of the cutting plane becomes very natural; this significantly facilitates the analysis of the part of the body or organ being examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,157 discloses a system for adjustment and rotation of cutting planes through a three-dimensional body as represented by the voxels that are stored in a storage member; therein the cutting plane is moved relative to an arbitrary origin selected from the image space. The solution in accordance with the invention, that is, situating the point of origin in the cutting plane itself instead of in an arbitrary position, however, is not known from the cited publication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In order to offer the person operating the medical analysis device in accordance with the invention more freedom of choice and possibilities for examnination, it is advantageous when the manipulating member is arranged to adjust the imaginary point of origin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A suitable and at the same time very simple method of realizing the foregoing is characterized in that the manipulating member is a mouse which is provided with a mouse cursor and a mouse button, and that the mouse button can be used to adjust the imaginary point of origin of the cutting plane and the mouse cursor can be used to adjust the orientation of the cutting plane. It is also possible to use a track ball or another suitable adjusting member for this purpose.</paragraph>
</summary-of-invention>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of the medical analysis device in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the device positions the imaginary point of origin at the center of gravity of the cutting plane. This saves an operation for adjustment by the user of the analysis device, thus simplifying the device while at the same time imparting a reproducible position to the point of rotation of the cutting plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a further elaboration of this application it may be advantageous that, when the cutting plane is readjusted, the device adapts the imaginary point of origin and keeps it positioned in the shifting center of gravity of the cutting plane. The determination of the center of gravity is based each time on the cutting plane as it is visible to the user in the image displayed by the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment of the analysis device in accordance with the invention the imaginary point of origin may (at the same time) form a point of rotation for the image displayed by the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to methods of processing a three-dimensional image. Methods in accordance with the invention are defined in the claims 11 and 13. The invention also relates to computer programs for the processing of a three-dimensional image. Computer programs in accordance with the invention are defined in the claims 12 and 14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is assumed that the above description is complete and clear to such an extent that a person skilled in the art can readily carry out the invention without requiring further information. </paragraph>
