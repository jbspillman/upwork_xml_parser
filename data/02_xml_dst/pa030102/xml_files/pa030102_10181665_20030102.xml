<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This disclosure relates to nested cables and to retractable cord reels and more specifically to nested cable and retractable cord reel assemblies for use with laptop computers and other electronic devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Internal rechargeable batteries power portable electronic devices such as laptop computers. Laptop computers are highly desirable due to their portability, which is directly related to their size and weight. Even though breakthroughs in computer technology have enabled manufacturers to miniaturize nearly all the computer components, advances in battery technology have been slow, resulting in little change in the size and weight of the batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The batteries in a typical laptop will power the computer for only a few hours, which is inadequate for a normal businessperson. Manufacturers prefer smaller batteries because it allows them to market a smaller, more desirable product, but power capacity (battery life) is sacrificed. As a result, laptop users carry their battery charger or electrical adapter with them to meetings or wherever else they travel, and connect the laptop to high voltage power whenever possible. Because of their dependence on computers, businesspersons cannot afford for their batteries to ever run out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Business people commonly bring their laptops everywhere they go during the workday (meetings, etc.), as well as home at night and on trips. This means they also bring the electrical adapter for the laptop everywhere they go. Laptop manufacturers have been very innovative in improving the portability of the laptops by adding such features as built-in or foldout mice. But little effort has been allotted to improving the portability of the electrical adapter that is taken along everywhere the laptop travels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Typical electrical adapters are a rectangular box about 2.5&Prime;&times;4&Prime;&times;1.25&Prime; high. It includes two cables usually about 6 feet long. one for high voltage power (extending from a wall socket to the adapter) and the other for low voltage power (which extends from the adapter to the laptop). When a person moves from an office to a conference room, he will simply fold up the laptop, but then must unplug the adapter and manually (sometimes randomly) coil the cord around his hand or around the adapter. Sometimes the cords are not coiled at all and simply dragged behind on the floor&excl; If a coiled cord is placed on a table or in a brief case, it will begin to uncoil as soon as it is let go. The lack of portability of a electrical adapter is very much out of sync with the excellent portability of the devices they power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Other electric devices also have problems with storage of power cords, particularly where two cords are attached to the same device. A sewing machine, for example, often has two cords extending from the foot pedal. House current is delivered to the pedal from one cord, regulated by a control device and the action of the pedal, then delivered to the machine by a second cord. Storage of the cords and foot pedal can be cumbersome. Even when a cord reel is used for one cord, the second cord must be stuffed in a separate compartment, stored in a separate reel or clumsily wrapped around the foot pedal for storage. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> These and other problems are solved by the nested cables and retractable cord reel assembly of the invention. A retractable cord reel assembly is described including a housing, a spool rotatably mounted in the housing, a first cable and a second cable, each at least partly carried by the spool, and means for releasably coupling the first cable to the second cable when the first and second cables are co-wound together onto and off of the spool. Preferably, the releasable coupling of the cables includes nesting the first and second cables together. One element for nesting of the cables includes providing one of the cables with a longitudinal cavity so that the other cable is nested into the cavity when the cables are wound together. As exemplified in the specific embodiments below, many modifications may be made for particular applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One particular embodiment comprises a nested cable and cord reel assembly designed for the electrical adapter for laptop computers and the cables attached to it. The assembly comprises a housing; a spool mounted for rotation in the housing; an electrical component, such as an electrical adapter, carried by the spool: a high voltage power cable having a first end connected to the electrical adapter, the high voltage power cable being windable onto and off of the spool, the high voltage cable having at least one longitudinal cavity; and a low voltage power cable having a first end connected to the electrical adapter, the low voltage cable being windable onto and off of the spool, the low voltage cable being releasably nested in the cavity of the high voltage cable when the two cables are co-wound together on said spool. The free end of the high voltage cable has a plug for connection to a standard electrical outlet. The free end of the low voltage cable has a plug or other connector adapted for connection to an electronic device, such as a laptop computer. The housing may include pocket(s) or chamber(s) for internally storing the plugs or connectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention is also useful for other electrical devices, such as a sewing machine. A nested cable and cord reel assembly is suitable to store both the cord delivering power from the house current and the cord delivering the regulated power to the sewing machine with the cords nested together. The cord reel is optionally designed to fit inside the foot pedal, which provides a convenient storage location. When it is desirable to store the sewing machine for later use, both cables are wound together into the cord reel assembly that also houses the power regulator in the pedal, providing compact and convenient storage of both cables inside the foot pedal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In its retracted state, the high voltage and low voltage plugs are inside the cord reel housing or against the side of the housing, and are easily accessible to the user. The user pulls either the high or low voltage cable to extract the desired length of cable. Since both cables are nested together when wound on the spool, approximately equal lengths of each cable are dispensed from the cord reel regardless of which cable is pulled. All or part of the cable stowed in the cord reel may be extracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> After use, the cord is retracted into the cord reel for neat storage and portability. Many of known methods can be used to retract the cable. A spring may be incorporated to bias the spool in the cord retracting direction, and a ratchet can be used to hold the cables in the extended position until retraction is desired. A motor or hand crank can also be used to retract the cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the consumer market where cost is a major consideration, the cord can be manually retracted by turning the electrical housing while holding the cord reel housing. Since the spool is attached to the electrical housing, turning the electrical housing causes the spool to rotate and the cables to retract.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A retractable cord reel assembly, generally designated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is described including a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted in the housing, a first cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a second cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, each at least partly carried by the spool, and means for releasably coupling the first cable to the second cable when the first and second cables are co-wound together onto the spool. Preferably, the releasable coupling of the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes nesting the first and second cables together. One element for nesting of the cables includes providing one of the cables with a longitudinal cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that the other cable is nested into the cavity when the cables are wound together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The following discussion is directed to preferred embodiments where the nested cables and cord reel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is designed for use with the electrical adapters for laptop computers. The cables are discussed in terms of high and low voltage cables, as would be applicable to laptop computers. However, it is to be understood that the cables need not carry high/low voltage and may carry the same voltage. The invention is intended to apply to any plurality of cables or cords that may advantageously be wound around a spool for storage. The cables need not be of different types and may be, for example, two ends of a single, continuous extension cord. The electrical component is optional and depends upon the intended use for the cables. The term &ldquo;electrical adapter&rdquo; is used to describe any electrical component, such as an power adapter, a switch, electrical converter, battery charger or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, which shows one embodiment of a laptop computer cord, the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, comprises a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted in the housing; an electronic converter or adapter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a high voltage power cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a low voltage power cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has two conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and an insulating jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. The low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may comprise a co-axial cable having an inner conductor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, insulating layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, outer conductor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and outer jacket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be of other multi-conductor configurations as well, and is not limited to co-axial. One of the cables is provided with a means for coupling the two cables together when they are wound onto the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The preferred form of coupling is nesting one cable with the other. Other forms of coupling means may be used, such as a tongue and groove or lateral displacement of the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to couple cables together side-by-side. Preferred nesting means is at least one longitudinal channel or cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on one of the cables adapted to receive the other cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> illustrate several alternative embodiments for nesting cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the two cables separated one from the other, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the two cables nested together. The high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is similar to a typical 2-conductor lamp cord but the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are separated creating a cavity or gap <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between them. The low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a multi-conductor cable covered with a jacket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> giving it a generally round cross section that fits in the gap <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Other cross sectional shapes can be used as long as the cables fit neatly together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Desirably, the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have coincident or nearly coincident neutral axes when coupled so that both cables have the same radius of curvature while the nested cables are being wound. The neutral axis is a theoretical line that does not change in length as an object bends. As the cables are bent in an arc to be wound around the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the portion of the jackets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the inside of the arc will be compressed, while the portion of the jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the outside of the arc will be stretched. Because the metal conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are much stiffer than the polymer jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that surround them, the neutral axis will be near the center of the conductor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the neutral axis of the high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not aligned with the neutral axis of the low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, each cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a different radius of curvature, and one cable is retracted slightly faster than the other, causing the cables to slide against each other as they are wound. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in some applications it is advantageous to move the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that the neutral axes of the two cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will be coincident or aligned when the cables are nested. Although shown in a particular nesting configuration, this option is suitable for use with any nested cables shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Both cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are wound on the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, with the low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> stowed in between the two high voltage power conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This nesting of the low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into the high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> allows both low and high voltage cables to be wound together, minimizing the space required to stow the cable. Other cord reels that lay one flat cable on top of the other (e.g., Peterson U.S. Pat. No. 4,646,987) work well only with very thin cables. Thick cables appropriate for power transmission would result in a cord reel of very large diameter if stacked in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Nesting the low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along side or in between the high voltage conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> results in a smaller diameter cord reel or spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The preferred configuration has the low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> nested in between the two high voltage conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, though variations that have the low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along side the pair of high voltage conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can also be acceptable in some applications. See FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When wound on the reel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the longitudinal cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> optionally faces either inwardly, toward the center of the reel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), or outwardly, toward the side walls of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Preferably, the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> faces inwardly, so that when the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are dispensed, the high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is on the outside. To extend the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, most users pull on the outside cable. In this configuration, the high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is most likely to be pulled and is better able to withstand the stress because it is generally a thicker, heavier cable than the low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In some applications, longitudinal cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be formed between adjacent windings in cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>. The high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> optionally has a first <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> grooves that meet to form the longitudinal cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are wound together, the low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> then nests between two windings of high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will fit partially inside the first groove <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the segment of high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and partially inside the second groove <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in an adjacent winding of cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As winding continues and the next winding of both cables are coupled, the low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is sandwiched in the grooves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> between subsequent adjacent windings of high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Although the first and second grooves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are shown symmetrically, it is contemplated that one of the cavities could be deeper than the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference> show yet another pair of nested cables that is particularly suitable when both cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are the same size. Each of the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a longitudinal cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into which at least a portion of the other cable nests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> For some applications it may be desirable to removably lock the two cables together in a nested configuration. A locking means <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is preferably formed by including at least one locking lip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on the outer edges of the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to grip the low voltage cable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> once it is placed within the cavity. See, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. However, such locking means <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is not strictly required. See, for example <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 10</cross-reference>, which do not include locking devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A friction device (not shown) is optionally used with any of the embodiments to prevent the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from unwinding at inopportune times. When all of the cables are retracted, if there is very little friction in the rotation of the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the spool may partially unwind, for example, as a result of the elasticity of the polymer insulation being bent as it wraps around the spool during the winding process. Use of a friction device would minimize any unwinding tendency after the winding was complete, or between turns of a manually wound unit. Devices of this type are well known in the art, for example, suitable friction may be applied by a Belleville or wave spring washer on the spool axis screw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> An electrical component <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be mounted to one side of the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as shown. The electrical component <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will take the form of a power converter for computer power cord applications. For sewing machine foot pedal applications, the component will take the form of a power regulatory switch. Other applications will require other electrical components as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For some applications, e.g., simple extension cords, no intermediate electrical component is required. In such applications, the two cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are spliced or otherwise connected in or adjacent to the reel hub <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, or the two cables are formed from two ends of a single cord that passes through the hub without modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a hub <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Both cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are connected to the electrical component <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, if present, at or near the hub <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are routed through a radial opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on the cord winding surface of hub <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, then routed through axial openings <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for connection to the electrical component module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Optionally, axial openings (not shown) are provided in the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the cable winding area adjacent hub <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to connect the cabels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into the electrical component module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, bypassing the interior of hub <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is shown as being square, however, alternate configurations may be used as desired to achieve the volume required to house the electronics and the desired aesthetics. For example the electrical component could be configured to fit partially or entirely within the hub <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the overall size of the unit is minimized to enhance portability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the preferred configuration, the cord reel housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will have cord guides and/or rollers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to guide the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into their nested position so they neatly lie flat together as they are wound on the spool. As the individual cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are fed between a plurality of cord guides <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, or a single cord guide and another stationary element, such as the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the two cables are pushed together into the nested position due to the limited spacing between the guides. One or more separating guides or rollers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are optionally added to separate the cords <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as they are retracted into the cord reel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If cords <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> become tangled during use, the separating guide roller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> prevents the tangled cords from getting stuck in the nesting guides <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The separating guide <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can also serve to separate the nested cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from each other as they are extended from the spool and to act as a stop to block inward movement of a line plug <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> after it is retracted into the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This keeps it in the proper place where it is conveniently reached by the user, allowing him to easily pull the plugs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for the next use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment of the reel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention has the plugs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> stored on the outside of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. An alternate preferred embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The reel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> mounted for rotation in the housing, and an optional electronics module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which comprises the electrical component. In the illustrated embodiments, the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> covers the circumferential edges <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and one side face <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the spool. The other side of the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is open to accommodate mounting of the electrical component module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> onto the spool. Mounting of the electronics module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the rotating spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferred to minimize breakage or twisting of the portions of cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> near the spool hub <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The details of mounting a spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for rotation within a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and retraction means, such as springs, are known in the art. See for example, Burke U.S. Pat. No. 5,094,396, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> illustrates a housing embodiment having a pocket or chamber <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for storing the high voltage or line plug <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and low voltage plug <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when not in use. Often, the line plug <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is molded onto the high voltage cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as an integral part of it. The plug <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> neatly fits into the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the storage chamber <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for the line plug <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is located to one side of the path followed by the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as they are retracted into the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Following retraction, the line plug <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is manually fit into the chamber for storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> show a third embodiment of the reel assembly of the invention in which the storage chamber <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is located along the path followed by the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as they are retracted into the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As retraction of the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is completed, the plugs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are drawn into the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and into the storage chamber <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> without separate handling by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> An optional opening <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the side of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows access to the plugs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when the cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are fully retracted into the housing. A lever, button, slide or other mechanism (not shown) may also be employed to push or pull the plugs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> out of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Where it is not desirable to store the plugs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> inside the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, guides <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are additionally used to prevent the plugs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from being retracted too far into the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The apparatus of the invention is adaptable for many different applications and/or special requirements. For example, some power converters require an EMI shield bead, also known as a ferrite bead. It is often installed on the low voltage cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> near the connector. When this occurs, the separating rollers or guides <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are suitably relocated or removed to allow room for the bead. The bead can optionally be relocated closer to the low voltage plug <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, incorporated as part of the plug or possibly moved into the power converter housing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or spool hub <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Various modifications of the shape or size of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or repositioning of elements to accommodate such requirements are considered to be within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the invention functions to provide for rotational mounting of the spool. The housing may fully involve the spool or it may be partially or fully open. The addition of doors, covers, latches or other optional mechanisms can be added if desired. Preferably, items such as these are omitted in order to minimize complexity, cost and the number of parts that are susceptible to breakage. However, addition of such features is also considered to be within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the co-wound, nested cables and reel assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention is a compact device that conveniently stores the low and high voltage power cables inside the housing. It can also house optional electrical components. It provides a facile solution to longstanding problems in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> While particular embodiments of the nested cables and cord reel assembly has been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the invention in its broader aspects and as set forth in the following claims. More specifically, although nested cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have been shown and described as the preferred embodiment, one may design other means for releasably coupling the two cables together when wound onto the spool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Although cables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with two conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have been shown, the invention is applicable to cables with one or more conductors. The roles of the high voltage cable and the low voltage cable may be reversed, or the cables may have the same voltage. The nested cables of the invention may have utility in applications other than retractable cord reels. Whereas the invention has particular utility as a power cord reel for laptop computers, the invention is equally applicable to other electric or electronic devices. Although an electrical component <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has been shown and described in a preferred embodiment, other electronic means may be used in other applications, such as a signal amplifier for electronic signal cables. These and other routine modifications of the cord reel assembly of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art. All such modifications and adaptations are intended to be covered by appended claims. </paragraph>
