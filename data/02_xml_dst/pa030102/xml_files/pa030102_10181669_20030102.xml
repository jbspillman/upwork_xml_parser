<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a heat-sealing method and a heat-sealing apparatus for fusing a fiber sheet of a bulky nonwoven fabric, a fiber web, a composite of a nonwoven fabric and a fiber web, a composite of a film and a fiber web, a composite of a film, a nonwoven fabric and a fiber web, or the like into a predetermined pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A fiber sheet of a nonwoven fabric, a fiber web or the like may be partially fused and used as a cleaning sheet. In Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No. 11-235301, for example, there is disclosed a cleaning sheet which is manufactured by heat-sealing a fiber sheet, as prepared by overlapping a fiber web of long fibers opened from TOW on a nonwoven fabric, partially and by slitting the nonwoven fabric and the fiber web in the region between fused lines formed by heat-sealing. In this cleaning sheet, the fiber web can sweep dust easily with brush-shaped portions, each of which is located between one fused line and one slit, and the fiber web is effective to trap the dust or relatively large pieces of trash with remaining portions, each of which is located between two fused lines while having no slit therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The heat-sealing method of the prior art for partially fusing a relatively bulky fiber sheet such as a laminate of the nonwoven fabric and the fiber web is performed by using rolls, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the heat-sealing method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> pair of rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are provided integrally with stealing ridges <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a predetermined pattern on their respective outer circumferences. These rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are heated to a temperature higher than the melting point of the fibers composing a fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and are rotated in the directions of arrows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is prepared by laminating a fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of long fibers opened from TOW on a base material sheet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of a nonwoven fabric and/or a film. The fibers forming the base material sheet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contain fusible fibers such as those of PET, PE or PP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fed into the clearance between the rotating rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the fiber sheet is partially pressed and heated between the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the rotating rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that the fusible fibers are fused to form fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. These fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed into a pattern identical to the pattern of the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The heat-sealing method using the rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, can perform the high-speed treatment when it is to fuse a less bulky nonwoven fabric or the like but is defective in that it has a poor fusing efficiency for a relatively bulky sheet such as the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> opened from TOW and is difficult to perform the high-speed treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the fibers, as opened from TOW, are in a crimped state so that the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a low density and a high volume of voids. When this bulky fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fed into the clearance between the rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that it is pressed between the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the presence of the air in the voids in the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> deteriorates the thermal conductivity in the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the fusible fibers take a time to be heated to a temperature higher than their melting point. Before the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is completely clamped, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, by the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, more specifically, the heated air in the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will go out to deteriorate the efficiency for heating the fusible fibers to the melting point or higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In order to fuse the fusible fibers to form the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, therefore, the speed of rotation of the rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has to be set at a low level so that the high-speed treatment cannot be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to eliminate this defect, it is conceivable to raise the temperature of the rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and to set the pressing forces of the rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. With these settings, however, when the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is heat-sealed by the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the fusible fibers in the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> especially on the sealing surface side are fused out or are cut by the pressure so that the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> easily become defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the heat-sealing method using the rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, on the other hand, the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is locally clamped between the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which are protruded from the two rolls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has portions of different thicknesses or when the pattern of the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed, for example, into a V-shape or a curved shape, therefore, the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is wrinkled or offset, as clamped by the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, or the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or its fibers themselves, as opened from TOW, are meandered so that the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be unable to have a precise pattern. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention has an object to provide a heat-sealing method and a heat-sealing apparatus for forming fused portions at a high speed even in a relatively bulky fiber sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a heat-sealing method and a heat-sealing apparatus for forming fused lines in a precise pattern, when the fiber sheet has portions of different thicknesses or when the fused portions have a V-shaped or curved pattern, by preventing the fiber sheet from being wrinkled or offset and the fiber sheet and its fibers themselves from being meandered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a heat-sealing method comprising: feeding a fusible fiber sheet into the clearance between a pair of rolls, at least one of which has sealing ridges of a predetermined pattern on its outer circumference; and heating and pressing the fiber sheet with the sealing ridges, to form fused portions corresponding to the pattern of the sealing ridges, in the fiber sheet, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> wherein an insulator is disposed to cover the outer circumference of the roll, as lacking the sealing ridges, and is made of a material which has a lower thermal conductivity than that of the sealing ridges and which can be elastically contracted by the pressure of the rolls; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> wherein the fiber sheet to be fed into the clearance between the rolls rotating is compressed by the insulator to discharge its internal air and is then heated and pressed by the sealing ridges so that it is heat-sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When the rolls are rotated and fed inbetween with a bulky fiber sheet, according to the invention, the fiber sheet is clamped by the insulator to expel the air from the fiber sheet to the outside, so that it is clamped by the sealing ridges when the air is expelled to a considerable extent. At the instant when the fiber sheet is clamped by the sealing ridges, therefore, the void volume in the fiber sheet is reduced so that the Fusible fibers in the fiber sheet are quickly heated by the heat of the sealing ridges. Therefore, the reliable heat-sealing can be ensured even if the rotating speed of the rolls is increased to raise the feeding rate of the fiber sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, since the bulky fiber sheet, as formed of a fibrous layer, is clamped by the sealing ridges after it was crushed by the insulators to some extent, even if the fiber sheet has the different thicknesses or if the fused portions have the V-shaped or curved pattern, the fiber sheet is neither wrinkled or offset, nor meandered are the fiber sheet or the fibers themselves, so that the fused portions formed can have a precise pattern without going out of position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention to be employed in the aforementioned heat-sealing method, there is provided a heat-sealing apparatus comprising a pair of rolls for heating and pressing a fusible fiber sheet to form fused portions of a predetermined pattern, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> wherein at least one of the paired rolls is provided with sealing ridges on its outer circumference for forming the fused portions of the predetermined pattern and with an insulator covering the region other than the sealing ridges; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> wherein the insulator is made of a material which has a lower thermal conductivity than that of the sealing ridges and which can be elastically contracted by the pressure of the rolls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the heat-sealing method and the heat-sealing apparatus, the insulator preferably has a thickness, when unexposed to the pressure of the rolls, equal to or larger than the height of the sealing ridges. Moreover, the insulator preferably has a thickness, when exposed to the pressure of the rolls being pressed, equal to or smaller than the height of the sealing ridges.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there are shown a pair of rolls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. These two rolls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are made of a metallic material having a high thermal conductivity such as steel or an alloy. Of these, one is the pattern roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is integrally provided with sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on its outer circumference. These sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed circumferentially in a plurality of patterns at a predetermined interval and are patterned into a shape of letter &ldquo;V&rdquo;, the crests <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of which are directed forward (i.e., in the direction &agr;) of the rotating direction of the pattern roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the outer circumference of the pattern roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is covered with an insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at its portions lacking the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is made of a material having a sufficiently lower thermal conductivity than that of the pattern roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a heat resistance and an elasticity, such as a foamed member made of a heat resisting resin, e.g., silicone, or heat resisting rubber, e.g., silicone rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The other is the anvil roll <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the outer circumference <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of which is a smooth cylindrical face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, this anvil roll <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is replaced by a pattern roll <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The pattern roll <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is integrally provided with sealing ridges <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on its outer circumference. These sealing ridges <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> have a pattern shape symmetric to the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed on the outer circumference of the pattern roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The outer circumference of the pattern roll <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is also provided with the insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at its portions lacking the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A bulky fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fed and heat-sealed either between the pattern roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the anvil roll <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or between the pattern roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the pattern roll <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The bulky fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is prepared by laminating a fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> over a nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for a base material sheet is exemplified by spun bond, thermal bond or spun lace nonwoven fabric and contains fusible fibers such as those of PET, PE or PP, or their composite fibers. Alternatively, the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be replaced by a fusible film of PET, PE or PP, or a laminate of the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the film may be employed as the base material sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a layer of either long fibers opened from TOW or fibers torn from a film, as called the &ldquo;splityarns&rdquo;, and these fibers extend mainly in the feed direction (MD) of the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also contains the fusible fibers such as those of PET, PE or PP, or their composite fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a low density with respect to the &ldquo;METSUKE&rdquo; (basis weight) and is bulky. Especially the long fibers, as opened from TOW, are crimped. On the other hand, the split yarns are not generally crimped but could be crimped for use. The fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made of those materials is bulky and has a large void volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fed into the clearance between the rolls rotating in the directions &agr; and &bgr;, it is clamped either between the insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the pattern roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the outer circumference <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) or between the insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the pattern roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the pattern roll <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) so that it is vertically crushed. Therefore, the air in the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is discharged before it is clamped by the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or between the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. When the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> clamp the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the void volume in the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is reduced to improve the thermal conductivity in the sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Thus, the fusible fibers in the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be heated for a short time to a temperature over a melting point so that fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be formed shortly and reliably in the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the rotating speed of the rolls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the rolls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be increased to increase the heat-sealing rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, it is unnecessary to raise the temperature of the rolls more than necessary and the pressure between the rolls more than necessary. As a result, the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be stably formed in the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are hardly made defective by the fusing or press-cutting of the fusible fibers on the seal surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> have the V-shaped pattern, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or a curved pattern, and when the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has portions of different thicknesses, on the other hand, the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is wrinkled or offset, or the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is easily meandered, if the fiber sheet is fed by clamping it only by the sealing ridges, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. If the pattern rolls are provided with the insulators <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on their outer circumferences, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, however, the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is clamped, compressed and restrained by the insulators <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and then fed to the sealing ridges so that its feed is stabilized. Therefore, the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is hardly wrinkled or offset, and the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is hardly meandered when fed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the pattern of the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, can be reliably formed without going out of position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the pattern rolls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in an enlarged scale. The thickness T of the insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is preferred, while it is not receiving the pressure between the rolls, to be equal to or larger than the height H of the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the upper limit of the thickness T is preferred to have such a size as to contract to the height H or less of the sealing ridges while the insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is receiving the pressure between the rolls. On the other hand, if the thickness T is larger than the height T when not pressed between the rolls, the insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is preferred to have such a modulus of elasticity as to contract, when pressed between the rolls, to a thickness T smaller than the height H of the sealing ridges. Even if the thickness T of the insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is smaller than the height H of the sealing ridges when not pressed between the rolls, however, it raises no serious problem if the insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is so thick as can push the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to discharge the internal air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the relation between the circumferential width W of the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the thickness TO of the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be set in the following manner. When the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fed into the clearance between the rotating rolls, it receives the pressure of the insulator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that its fiber layer is clamped in advance to discharge the internal air, and then receives the clamping pressure of the sealing ridges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a top plan view showing a cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A exemplifying the fiber sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which has the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formed by the heat-sealing method using the heat-sealing apparatus shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a sectional view taken along line VI-VI of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In this cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, as hereinbefore described, the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of long fibers opened from TOW is laminated over the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (or a film or a laminate of a film and a nonwoven fabric). The cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A is provided with holding sheets <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the two side portions in the widthwise direction (CD). These holding sheets <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are made similar to the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sandwiched at its two side portions between the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the holding sheets <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the holding sheets <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are adhered by a hot-melt adhesive or fused and jointed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> This cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A is provided with the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the V-shaped pattern by the heat-sealing method, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and at which the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are jointed. Between the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, moreover, there are formed slits <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which are arranged parallel to the V-shape pattern at intervals. These slits <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed by cutting through the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> together. Moreover, the fibers composing the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are napped, if necessary. As a result, in a region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> hatched in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the fibers forming the fiber web <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are clipped at the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and are released at the slit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the cut fibers extending from the fused portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the slit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> form a brush-shaped portion. Such brush-shaped portions of the fiber web are formed all the regions that are sandwiched between the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the slits <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In this cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, the brush-shaped portions can wipe off dust or the like. In the remaining regions lacking the slits <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the fiber layer extends in a bridge shape between the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> adjoining in the MD so that it can trap the dust or relatively large pieces of trash between the fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Here, the present invention should not be limited to the heat-sealing of the aforementioned composite fiber sheet of the nonwoven fabric and the fiber web but could be applied to the heat-sealing of only the fiber web or the nonwoven fabric, which is bulky and has a low density but a large void volume, such as an air-through nonwoven fabric. On the other hand, the fused portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should not be limited to the continuous line shape, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but could also be practiced by dotted sealing embosses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As has been described hereinbefore, according to the invention, even the bulky fiber sheet having the large void volume can be heat-sealed at a high speed by using the rolls. Even if the fiber sheet has portions of different thicknesses or if the fused portions have the V-shaped pattern or a curved shape, the fiber sheet can be reliably heat-sealed while being fed into the clearance between the rolls so that the fused portions can be formed without fail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Here, &lsquo;comprises/comprising&rsquo; when used in this specification is taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps or components but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Although various exemplary embodiments have been shown and described, the invention is not limited to the embodiments shown. Therefore, the scope of the invention is intended to be limited solely by the scope of the claims that follow. </paragraph>
