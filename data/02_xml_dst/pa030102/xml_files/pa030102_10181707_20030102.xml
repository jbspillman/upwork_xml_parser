<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> With the recent development and progress in nanotechnology, it has been apractice to handle cells, proteins, genes and so on at a level of several individuals. As a result, it becomes necessary to inject and treat microsamples into containers (wells) for reaction, analysis or detection. To carry out a series of reactions, analyses, detections, etc. on microchips, use is sometimes made of a structure wherein a plural number of wells are connected to each other each via a pipe, a groove or a channel. In such a case, attention should be taken to prevent the migration of a sample into the adjacent well due to the injection pressure, which brings about some difficulties not only in manual operations but also in operations with the use of an automatic injection device. It is also desired to adjust the position of a sample injected into a microwell or to transfer the sample into the next well while adjusting the position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a structure to be used in the above-described apparatus whereby, in the step of injecting amicrosample into a well, the migration of the sample into another well or overflow from the well can be certainly prevented. It is another object of the present invention to provide a structure wherein the position of an injected sample in a well can be adjusted or the sample can be transferred into the next well under controlling. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a microsample treatment apparatus wherein a sample can be injected and transferred under automated control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells with the application of the structure having the functions as described above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a microsample treatment apparatus having a structure wherein a plural number of wells are connected to each other via a part having resistance to fluids and the wells are each provided with tubes for injecting/sucking a sample and, if necessary, tubes for relieving pressure changes at the injection/suction, characterized in that these tubes have a space in common at the top ends thereof in which a liquid can be held. The part having resistance to fluids may be selected from among one or more thin pipes, narrow gaps, thin grooves, filters, resin-filled columns and other structures through which a fluid can be passed but which have resistance to fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention further relates to a microsample treatment apparatus wherein the top end of a tube formed in a well is located upper than the top ends of the tubes formed in one or more wells opposite thereto across the part having resistance to fluids. The microsample treatment apparatus according to the present invention may have, in one or both of wells connected to each other via a channel, a wall formed orthogonal to the channel to thereby restrict the amount of a liquid in the vicinity of the channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a microsample treatment apparatus which comprises a unit part having a single unit selected from the microsample treatment apparatuses as described above, an integration unit having a plural number of units of the same or different types or a plural number of integration units, a pipette or pipettes for controlling the liquid level in the unit part, and a system for controlling the operation of the liquid level control pipette(s). Moreover, the present invention relates to an automated microsample treatment apparatus characterized in that the liquid level control pipette(s) are controlled so as to suck a definite amount of a liquid contained in the space held in common by a plural number of tubes at the top ends thereof in each of the units in the unit part, thereby adjusting the position of the sample in well(s) or transferring the sample into the respective next well(s) followed by, if necessary, supplying the liquid in a compensatory amount to return the liquid face to the original level. If necessary, the microsample treatment apparatus may be provided with a sample reservoir, a specimen reservoir, pipette(s) washing part and sample supply pipette(s) and specimen supply pipette(s) which are movable over these parts and further have a system for controlling the operations of these pipettes. The materials of the pipettes are not restricted to glass but can be appropriately selected from among metals, plastics and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention involves in its scope an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells characterized in that a plural number of wells are connected to each other via a part having resistance to fluids, the wells are each provided with tubes for injecting/sucking a sample and, if necessary, tubes for relieving pressure changes at the injection/suction, these tubes have a space in common at the top ends thereof in which a liquid can be held, and the wells are closely adhered to a glass substrate in the side opposite to the tube side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention further relates to an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells as described above characterized in that the top end of a tube formed in a well for holding cells is located upper than the top ends of the tubes formed in one or more wells opposite thereto across the channel having resistance to fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, it is preferable that the channel having resistance to fluids is a bank and a narrow gap is formed between the bank and the glass substrate. In this case, a terrace may be formed in the upper part of the bank in the channel to form a gap between the terrace and the glass substrate. Alternatively, barriers constituting one or more grooves having a width fit for the diameter or deformability of cells may be formed in the upper part of the bank and, if necessary, a terrace may be further formed together with the bank to form a gap fit for the diameter or deformability of cells between the terrace and the glass substrate too. A plural number of grooves in the direction toward the opposite well in the channel may be connected to each other via one or more grooves orthogonal thereto. It is also possible that the width of a plural number of grooves in the direction toward the opposite well in the channel is changed stepwise each time the grooves intersect one or more grooves orthogonal thereto. Furthermore, a plural number of grooves in the direction toward the opposite well in the channel may be formed by mutually shifting the positions thereof each time the grooves intersect one or more grooves orthogonal thereto. Moreover, arrays of the barriers constituting the grooves may be formed at two positions in both sides of the terrace formed at the center of the bank. It is also possible that multistage terraces are formed on the bank in the channel so as to form gaps with different depths between the terrace and the glass substrate. In one or both of wells connected to each other via a channel, moreover, a wall may be formed orthogonal to the channel to thereby restrict the amount of a liquid in the vicinity of the channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an automated apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells comprising a unit part having a single unit selected from the apparatuses for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells as described above, an integration unit having a plural number of units of the same or different types or a plural number of integration units, a cell reservoir, a specimen reservoir and liquid level control pipette(s), cell supply pipette(s) and specimen supply pipette(s) which are movable over these parts, and further having a detection part for detecting cell migration in the unit part and, if necessary, recording the detection data which is integrated with the unit part or formed so as to correspond to a plural number of unit parts, and further having a system for controlling the movements of the liquid level control pipette(s), the cell supply pipette(s) and the specimen supply pipette(s) and, if necessary, a system for moving the unit part to the detection part and the next unit part to the pipette flow line. If necessary, this apparatus may further have a pipette washing part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention further relates to an automated apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells characterized in that the operations of the respective pipettes are controlled as follows: after optionally stirring, a definite amount a cell suspension is sucked by the cell supply pipette(s) and supplied into the unit part; then a definite amount of a liquid, which is contained in the space held by the top ends of a plural number of tubes in common in each unit, is sucked by the liquid level control pipette(s) to thereby adjust the position of the cells in the wells; the liquid in the compensatory amount is supplied from the liquid level control pipette(s) into the space to thereby return the liquid face to the original level; then a definite amount of a specimen is sucked from the specimen reservoir by the specimen supply pipette(s) and supplied into the unit part; then the pipettes move toward the pipette washing part in which they are washed by repeatedly sucking and discharging the washing liquor.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The microsample treatment apparatus according to the present invention provided with wells into which a sample such as a liquid or a suspension is injected is an apparatus for handling organic or inorganic chemicals, polymers such as proteins, genes, cells and so on in the state of solutions or suspensions. Although the structure of the present invention is not specifically restricted in the amount of samples to be treated, it is expected that high technical merits can be achieved thereby in case of using samples of the order of several milliliters to microliters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The present invention is applied to case wherein a plural number of wells are connected to each other via a structure having resistance to fluids and the wells are each provided with tubes for injecting or sucking a sample and, if necessary, tubes for relieving pressure changes at the step of the injecting or sucking the sample. That is, such an apparatus has a plural number of tubes as a whole. In the present invention, these tubes have a space in common at the top ends thereof in which a liquid can be held. Owing to this structure, unexpected migration and overflow caused by a rapid change in pressure in the wells in the step of injecting or sucking a sample or unexpected migration of the sample caused by horizontal off balance of the apparatus can be effectively prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> By employing the structure wherein a plural number of tubes have a space in common at the top ends thereof in which a liquid can be held, the position of a sample can be adjusted in a microwell or the sample can be transferred into the next well under controlling, in case of handling samples the position of which should be adjusted in the well or which should be transferred into the next well. To further ensure the control and migration, the top end of a tube formed in the well for holding the sample is located upper than the top ends of tubes formed in other wells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> To enable the migration of a sample among a plural number of wells, the wells are usually connected to each other via, for example, thin pipes, narrow gaps, thin grooves, filers, resin-filled columns or channels. The present invention relates to an apparatus wherein a plural number of wells are connected to each other via such a structure having resistance to a fluid flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Now, illustration will be made on the application the present invention to an apparatus wherein a plural number of wells are connected to each other each via a channel, for example, an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells. However, it is obvious from the description given above that the present invention is not restricted to apparatuses for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells but applicable to various apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In the apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells, a cell suspension is put into one of the wells while a specimen solution is put into the other well. Then it is detected whether or not cells migrate toward the well holding the specimen solution, or cells which have migrated are selectively collected. In this apparatus, for example, the well holding the cell suspension is connected to the well holding the specimen solution via a channel. Thus, the state where the cells are passing through the channel is observed, or the cells which are passing or have passed through the channel are counted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> A channel which makes it possible to observe or detect the passage of individual cells has resistance to fluids. In an apparatus provided with such channels, it is sufficient to employ only a small amount of cells as a sample, which brings about a merit of being adequate for examining rare cells. In addition, there is another merit that quantitative analysis can be made. In this case, however, the whole apparatus is in a small size and thus samples should be handled in microquantities. As a result, there frequently arises unexpected migration of cells toward a well holding a specimen solution under the effect of an increase in pressure caused by the injection into the wells. In case the wells are not held horizontally after the injection, moreover, cells would migrate. These unexpected migrations of cells result in confusion in the judgment whether the specimen is a chemotactic factor or not. To accurately detect the migration of cells toward a well holding a specimen solution by their own actions, it is therefore required to prevent the migration of the cells at the point of injecting a sample or after the injection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As one of countermeasures thereto, the present inventors have proposed a structure wherein each well has a tube for injecting a sample and an additional well connected thereto for relieving an increase in pressure at the injection (Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-226466). Now, this structure will be briefly described by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In the apparatus shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> cell suspension is injected into a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through a tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A. A specimen solution is injected into a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B through a tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B. In case where this specimen contains a chemotactic factor, cells tend to migrate from the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A toward the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B and thus pass through the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> gap corresponding to the cell size is provided between a bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a transparent glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, barriers constituting a plural number of thin grooves through which individual cells can pass may be formed. The state of the cells passing through the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be observed by, for example, a microscope <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through the glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a bottom plan view of the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the apparatus shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and the tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B are connected to each other in the respective wells. In this structure, pressure is dispersed through the tubes connected to each other. In the present invention, in contrast thereto, the top ends of all of the tubes formed in respective wells have a space in common in which a liquid can be held. Owing to this structure, the migration at the injection can be more surely relieved or the migration can be controlled (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an example of the structure according to the present invention which is a unit consisting of a substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is held in common by the top ends <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ab and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bb of tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B formed in respective wells. The whole apparatus is filled up with a liquid not affecting chemotaxis such as a buffer solution. The amount of the liquid is sufficient for at least filling up a part of the space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Owing to this liquid, the whole apparatus is maintained under a definite pressure. Moreover, the resistance of the liquid contributes to the prevention of rapid migration of a sample caused by the injection pressure and horizontal off balance of the wells. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows another example of the structure according to the present invention. In this unit, wells are provided with tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B for injecting a sample and, further, tubes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B connected thereto and a space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided by the top ends <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ab, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>Ab, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bb and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>Bb of all of these tubes in common. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the step of collecting the migrated cells by sucking from a well holding the specimen through a tube formed in the well, the inner pressure is reduced and thus the samples in wells are mixed each other. In the structure as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, this phenomenon can be particularly effectively relieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In case of detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating cells, it is preferable that the injected cells are first brought together in the vicinity of a channel in a well. In case of the apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for example, it is preferable that cells injected into the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A are located in the vicinity of the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Namely, these cells may be considered as an example of a sample whose position in a well should be adjusted. This position adjustment can be carried out by sucking an appropriate amount of the liquid at an appropriate speed from the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B located oppositely across the channel through the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B. The amount of the liquid to be sucked is determined based on the capacities of the tube and the well after discharging the liquid from the space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The amount of the liquid to be sucked and the sucking speed can be easily controlled by a computerized program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The present invention further involves in its scope, as a modification of the above-described structure, a microsample treatment apparatus such as an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells having a structure wherein the top end of a tube formed in a well for holding, for example, a cell suspension is located upper than the top end of a tube formed in another well opposite thereto across a channel (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having a tube mounted thereon has been cut downward around the top end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bb of a tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B formed in a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. Thus, the top end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ab of the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A in a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is located upper than the top end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bb of the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B. At first, the amount of a liquid filling up the whole apparatus is controlled so that the liquid level is located above the top end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ab of the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A, i.e., the position indicated by the arrow I in the figure. When cells are injected into the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A in this state, rapid migration of the cell is prevented due to the uniform pressure in the whole apparatus and the resistance of the liquid. Thus, the cells scatter in the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. Next, the liquid is sucked off from the space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the liquid level is lowered to the position indicated by the arrow II (i.e., such a level as making the tope end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ab of the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A visible above the liquid face<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A). Further, an appropriate amount of the liquid is sucked off and thus the cells scattering in the vicinity of the channel in the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A can be brought together. The amount of the liquid to be sucked off can be calculated based on the capacities of the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. In usual, the object can be achieved by sucking off the liquid in an amount {fraction (1/10)} to &frac13; times as much as the capacities. By injecting the specimen solution into the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B after returning the liquid level to the position indicated by the arrow I, a rapid change in pressure at the injection can be relieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As the liquid employed for returning the liquid level to the position indicated by the arrow I, it is preferable to use a liquid having a lower specific gravity than the liquid preliminarily contained in the apparatus (e.g., an aqueous solution such as a buffer solution). Thus, the upper part of the tubes in each well can be covered with the liquid having the lower specific gravity and thus the unnecessary diffusion of the sample can be prevented owing to the covering effect. An arbitrary liquid can be selected therefor so long as it is inert to the sample, insoluble in water and has a specific gravity lower than 1.0. Examples thereof include Mineral Water M3516 (specific gravity: 0.84, manufactured by Sigma) and liquid paraffin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an example of a unit having tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B for injecting a sample and tubes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B connected thereto in each well, wherein the top ends <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ab and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>Ab of the tubes in a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A are located upper than the top ends <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bb and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>Bb of the tubes in another well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an example wherein a slope is formed on a block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> so that the top ends of tubes in a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A are located upper. These figures show the examples wherein the top ends of some tubes are located upper than the top ends of other tubes. Various modifications can be further made to achieve the same object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The above-described structure wherein the top ends of some tubes are located upper than the top ends of other tubes is effective in the connecting manners as will be described hereinbelow. If necessary, other unit(s) may be further jointed and connected to a double system for connecting wells each via a channel as shown by FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to thereby give, for example, a triple system shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, for example, cells are put into a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, a chemotactic factor is put into a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C and a specimen solution is put into a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. Thus, it can be examined whether or not the specimen solution inhibits the chemotactic factor. Moreover, multiple systems are applicable to various purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows, it is also possible to construct a so-called concentric system wherein a plural number of wells are connected to each other each via a channel around a single well. Furthermore, a concentric circular system as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> may be constructed as a modification of the type of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Although a triple system is employed in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, it is also possible to employ a double system. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A is mounted to a penetrating hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Aa. Similarly, tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>are mounted to penetrating holes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1a-4a </subscript></highlight>while tubes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>are mounted to penetrating holes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1a-4a </subscript></highlight>respectively. A cell suspension is supplied into a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and various specimens are supplied into wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4</subscript></highlight>. Thus, a plural number of chemotactic factors can be examined at the same time. By supplying a sample containing a plural types of cells, the cells can be separated depending on types at once (i.e., sorting). For example, chemotactic factors corresponding to respective cell types are put into the wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>and a sample containing plural types of cells (for example, whole blood) is supplied into the central well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. Then the cells contained in the sample migrate toward the wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>containing the corresponding chemotactic factors. After a definite period of time, the cells are collected from each of the wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>through the tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>or cells having migrated into the wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>are identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In the well-connecting manners as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected to each other in the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in which they are provided. In these connecting manners, all of the tubes hold at the top ends thereof a space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in common. The top ends of the tubes in a well into which cells are injected are located upper than the top ends of other tubes. Then a liquid is supplied so that the top ends of the tubes in the well into which cells are injected are submerged (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). FIG. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a sectional view of the apparatus shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> along the dashed and dotted line. In this example, the top ends <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ab and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>Ab of tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A in a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A are located upper than the top ends <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1b-4b </subscript></highlight>of tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>in other wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4</subscript></highlight>. An arrow I shows that the level of the liquid filling up the space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is located above the top ends <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ab and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>Ab of the tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A. Cells injected into the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A scatter in the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. Then the liquid in the space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sucked off and thus the liquid level is lowered to the position indicated by another arrow II so that the top end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ab of the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A becomes visible above the liquid face. Then an appropriate amount of the liquid is further sucked off. Thus, the cells in the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A can migrate toward the wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>and thus are brought together in the vicinity of the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> toward respective wells. The amount of the liquid to be sucked off can be calculated based on the capacities of the tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. Thus, the chemotaxis of the cells in the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A concerning the wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>can be examined under the same positional conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As another example of the embodiment to which the structure of the present invention can be applied, an apparatus shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> may be cited. Namely, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a model view of an apparatus wherein a reaction is carried out in a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A followed by a treatment through a column <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and then unadsorbed substances passing through the column are collected from a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. In this case, the column serves as an obstacle having resistance to fluids. Substances to be reacted are put into the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A in the state that the liquid level is at the position indicated by an arrow I. After the completion of the reaction, the liquid level is lowered to the position indicated by another arrow II. After further sucking, the reaction mixture migrates from the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A toward the column <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. By further sucking, a substance passing through the column migrates toward the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. In case where the substance adsorbed by the column is the target substance, the eluate is supplied into the column via the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. Thus, the eluted substance can be collected in the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above-described case, various applications can be made. That is to say, interactions among substances can be examined at the level of microquantities by controlling the migration of samples among wells which are connected to each other. For example, these apparatuses are applicable to antigen/antibody reactions, enzyme/substrate reactions, reactions between soluble receptors and ligands, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A of the apparatus shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, for example, an antibody bonded to plastic beads of a definite size is reacted with an antigen protein. Then the liquid level is lowered from I to II and further the liquid is sucked off. Thus the unreacted antigen protein passes through the groove in the barrier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and migrates into the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. However, an antigen which has reacted with the antibody bonded to the plastic beads cannot pass through the groove in the barrier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> because of the presence of the beads, thereby being separated from the unreacted antigen protein. Thus, substances can be separated by appropriately selecting the combination of the bead size and the groove width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to use magnetic beads. For example, magnetic beads having a uniform particle size, which are composed of polymer cores having a magnetizable substance (for example, &ggr;Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Fe<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) uniformly distributed therein and a hydrophilic polymer coating, are commercially available (Dynabeads&reg; manufactured by DYNAL, Norway) . By bonding various antibodies onto the surface of these beads, the magnetic beads can be bonded to cells or proteins. By bringing close to a powerful magnet (MPC), the magnetic beads are magnetized and attracted to the magnet. When the magnet is moved away, the beads are demagnetized and thus scatter again. These characteristics have been used in purifying cells, proteins, etc. For example, Kanegasaki, S. et al. isolated peripheral B lymphocytes by using magnetic polystyrene beads (manufactured by DYNAL) coated with CD19 antibody (J. Biochem., 117:758-765 (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In an apparatus shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22, a</cross-reference> protein mixture and antibodies labeled with magnetic beads (magnetic antibody beads) are injected into a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A at the liquid level I. After adsorbing a protein reacted with the antibody by a magnet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> provided at the bottom of the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, the liquid level is lowered to II. Then the liquid is sucked off from a space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, a protein unadsorbed by the magnet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> alone migrates into another well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. By selecting an appropriate antibody, a desired protein can be thus separated or an unnecessary protein can be thus eliminated. For separate proteins with the use of magnetic materials, it has been a practice to use columns. However, treatments with columns can be performed on the milliliter scale and, therefore, are unsuitable for treating proteins in microquantities. By using the apparatus according to the present invention, proteins can be separated even on the scale of several microliters or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The present invention makes it possible to downsize the whole apparatus and thus samples can be treated in microquantities. Moreover, it is possible to integrate multiplicity of units and thus a large number of specimens can be treated at the same time. In addition, the treatment can be easily automated by programmed control of suction and injection of liquids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the apparatus can be automated by providing a unit part having a single unit, an integration unit having a plural number of units of the same or different types or a plural number of integration units, liquid level control pipette(s) and a system for controlling the movements of the liquid level control pipette(s). The operations of the liquid level control pipette(s) are controlled as follows. Namely, a definite amount of a liquid, which is contained in the space held by the top ends of a plural number of tubes in common in each unit, is sucked by the liquid level control pipette(s) to thereby adjust the position of a sample in the well, or transfer the sample into the next well and, if necessary, the liquid in the compensatory amount is supplied from the liquid level control pipette(s) into the space to thereby return the liquid face to the original level. These controlling operations can be easily carried out by computerized programming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to automate the whole apparatus involving the steps of supplying and collecting a sample, a specimen, a reagent, etc. by providing a unit part, a sample reservoir, a specimen reservoir and sample supply pipette(s) and specimen supply pipette(s) movable over these parts and further a system for controlling the operations of these pipettes. If necessary, it is also possible to add a pipette washing part and a system for controlling the operation of washing the pipettes in the pipette washing part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Next, the structure of the apparatus according to the present invention will be described in greater detail by reference to an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells as an example. However, it is to be understood that the present invention is not restricted to an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells but applicable to other apparatuses in order to solve similar technical problems as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> 1) Structure of Unit </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows, a channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are integrally formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has holes (penetrating holes) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Aa and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ba for mounting tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B connected to respective wells. A block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having the tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B is fixed so as to fit for the penetrating holes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Aa and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ba. In the upper part of the block, a space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> commonly held by the top ends <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Ab and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bb of the tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Aand <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B is provided. The bottom face of the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is adhered to an optically polished glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be pressed and fixed by fastening, for example, with an O-ring or a packing (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>). Alternatively, the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be integrally formed. Alternatively, the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be integrally formed. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows, the tubes formed in the wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B may be further provided with tubes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B, etc. for injecting/collecting a sample and tubes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B, etc. for relieving pressure changes. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>. etc. show, the space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be partly cut downward to form a concave. Alternatively, a slope may be formed as shown by FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> 2) Well </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed for holding a sample (i.e., a cell suspension) or a specimen solution such as a solution containing a chemotactic factor or a solution containing an inhibitor therefor. The capacity of the wells is not particularly restricted, so long as a liquid can be held therein in the minimum amount needed. For example, it is sufficient that the depth ranges from about 0.05 to about 0.1 mm, the width is about 1.2 mm and the length is about 2.5 mm. It is also possible to provide a wall orthogonal to a channel in one or both of wells connected to each other via the channel (for example, the well for holding cells) to thereby restrict the amount of the liquid in the vicinity of the channel. Thus, the position of cells in the well can be adjusted (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows an example wherein wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are connected to each other via a channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B are formed in respective wells orthogonally to the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Although the distance between the walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be arbitrarily determined, it usually ranges from 50 to 300 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> shows modification examples of the well unit having walls provided orthogonally to the channel. That is, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) shows an example wherein a channel is formed in a part of the well width; (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) shows an example wherein a channel is halved at the center, a couple of wells (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C) are provided opposite to a single well (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A) across the channel, and a wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed exclusively in the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A side; and (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) shows an example wherein two arrays of barriers are formed in both sides of a terrace <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a channel. Needless to say, these modifications are cited merely by way of example and thus the present invention is not restricted thereto. If necessary, a terrace may be formed between the wall provided orthogonally to the channel and the bank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> 3) Channel </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Now, an example of the structure of a channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) will be illustrated by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a space provided between a bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (a convex on a substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) partitioning wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B at both ends and a glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> partitioning the wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B formed at both ends of the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not restricted in size. For example, the height of the bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may range from about 0.03 to about 0.1 mm, while the length in the direction toward the opposite well may range from about 0.01 to about 0.5 mm and the length in the direction orthogonal to the direction toward the opposite well may be about 1.2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a plural number of barriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed on the bank to thereby constitute grooves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through which cell pass, as shown by FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In case where no barrier constituting grooves is formed in the upper part of the bank, a terrace providing a gap or a depth fit for the diameter or deformability of cells is formed between the upper face of the bank and the glass substrate. In this case, the depth usually ranges from 3 to 50 &mgr;m depending on the type of cells. That is to say, the width may range from 3 to 10 &mgr;m (for example, 4, 5, 8 or 10 &mgr;m) in case of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes/macrophages, T cells, B cells and the like, and from 8 to 20 &mgr;m in case of cancer cells and cells existing in tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> By forming flat terraces in both sides of the barriers on the upper face of the bank, the passage of cells can be more easily observed. Thus, it is favorable to form terraces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), though they are not essentially required. In case of providing the terraces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the length thereof in the direction toward the opposite well appropriately ranges from about 0.01 mm to about 0.5 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> By forming multistage terraces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows, cells put into wells in one side can be easily brought together in the vicinity of the bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by sucking from the other side to adjust the position of the cells in the well. In case where the cells are neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, etc., for example, the distance between the terraces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;2 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;3 </subscript></highlight>and a glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (i.e., corresponding to the height of a barrier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the figure) is set to 3 &mgr;m and the distance between the terraces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;4 </subscript></highlight>and a glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is set to 4.5 &mgr;m. Then cells are supplied into a well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and the liquid is sucked from the side of another well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. Then the cells once stop at the terrace <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;1</subscript></highlight>. Next, the cells are liable to bring together between the terrace <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;2 </subscript></highlight>and the glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The distance between each of the terraces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;1 to 4 </subscript></highlight>and the glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be arbitrarily determined depending on the sample to be treated. Although these distances usually range from about 3 to 5 &mgr;m, the present invention is not restricted thereto. When the terrace (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;3</subscript></highlight>) in the side opposite to the wells containing the cells is made about 1.5 to 5 times longer than the terrace (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;2</subscript></highlight>) in the side of the wells containing the cells, the cells having passed through the channel can be more easily observed and counted. Although a barrier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed in the example shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, the barrier is not always necessary in case where the distance between the terraces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;2 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>&minus;3 </subscript></highlight>and the glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> corresponds to the diameter or deformability of cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In case where barriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) are formed on the upper face of the bank, grooves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> constituted by the barriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have an arbitrary cross-sectional shape, for example, a V-shaped section, a convex section or a semicircular section. It is preferable that the grooves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> have a width fit for the diameter or deformability of cells. The term &ldquo;deformability&rdquo; of cells as used herein means that, in case of flexible cells, the cells can easily change their shape (for example, into flat or string-shaped cells) owing to the flexibility and thus can pass through a gap having a smaller size than the diameter of the cells being in the inherent spherical shape in a free space. By forming such grooves, cells can be observed at individual level and thus separated depending on desired types. The width of a groove <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> usually may range from 3 to 50 &mgr;m. It is preferable that the width allows the passage of cells one by one. Thus an appropriate width may be selected depending on the cell type. The width may range from 3 to 10 &mgr;m (for example, 3, 5, 8 or 10 &mgr;m) in case of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes/macrophages, T cells, B cells and the like, and from 8 to 20 &mgr;m in case of cancer cells and cells existing in tissues. The number of the grooves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is determined depending on the width of the barriers concerning the channel width and the groove width. In case where the channel width is 1 mm, the barrier width is 10 &mgr;m and the groove width is 5 &mgr;m, for example, the number of grooves is <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> at the largest. To smoothly perform the detection and observation, the number of the grooves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> preferably ranges from 1 to about 100, still preferably from about 10 to about 70. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The length of the barriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> ranges from about 5 to about 400 &mgr;m. For example, use may be made of a barrier length of 5, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 100, 200, 300 or 400 &mgr;m. The width of the barriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> per se can be appropriately determined. In case of employing the structure as will be shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> hereinafter, it is effective that the width and length of the barriers are almost the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows, the grooves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> constituting the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be connected to each other via one or more grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> orthogonal to the direction toward the opposite well. Owing to this structure, the diffusion of a substance put into one well toward the other well can be uniformized, or cells under passage can be more accurately understood. In this case, the width of the grooves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be changed stepwise each time the grooves intersect grooves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> orthogonal thereto in the direction toward the opposite well (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</cross-reference>). Alternatively, grooves in the direction toward the opposite well may be formed by mutually shifting the positions thereof each time the grooves intersect grooves orthogonal thereto (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> shows an example wherein the grooves are formed as shifting by &frac12; pitch in the orthogonal direction. It is also possible that the barriers are jointed to each other in the direction toward the opposite well (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>). Alternatively, arrays of barriers can be formed in two positions in both side of a terrace which is formed at the center of the bank (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). By using these structures, cells having passed the grooves can be easily observed and counted. It is desirable that the terrace located at the center has an area which can be included in the microscopic field. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is a top plan view while (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is a sectional view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The height of the barrier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (i.e., the depth of the grooves) may be appropriately determined depending on the depth of focus of the objective lens of a microscope, a CCD camera, etc. to be used in observing the cell migration. For example, a depth of about 3 to about 4.5 &mgr;m is preferable in case of an objective lens having a focus depth of 10 to 40&times; magnification, though the present invention is not restricted thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> 4) Construction of Well and Channel </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> As a material of the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, it is preferable to use single-crystal silicon which can be easily fine processed and is relatively inert to cells. The barriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the grooves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be constructed by subjecting the single-crystal silicon to photolithography or etching (for example, wet etching or dry etching) employed in manufacturing integrated circuits. The wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the penetrating holes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which are larger than the barriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the grooves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, can be constructed by using various known engineering techniques such as sand blasting and dry etching. In addition to single-crystal silicon, use can be made of hard glasses, hard plastics, metals, etc., so long as a microstructure can be constructed in the channel. In case of using plastics, it is preferable to employ a treatment for making the surface hydrophilic, for example, forming a hydrophilic film on the surface. It is also possible to separately construct the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and then combine them together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> 5) Block and Tube </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> As shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a member located on the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and having tubes connected to wells. The tubes usually have a square or circular cross-sectional shape. Although these tubes are not restricted in size, a square tube has a side length of about 1 mm while a round tube has a diameter of about 1 mm in usual. To hold a cell suspension or a specimen solution in a desired volume, it is necessary that these tubes have a length of about 2 to about 10 mm. The materials of the block or tubes maybe selected from among glasses, plastics such as acrylic resins and metals. The tubes can be easily produced by using commonly employed engineering techniques such as mechanical drilling or laser drilling. Similarly, the space held commonly by the top ends of the tubes can be formed above the block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by usual engineering techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> To inject cells or a specimen into each unit by hands (i.e., manually), the periphery of the top end of each supply tube may be cut downward to thereby form a funnel-shaped concave. Thus, a pipette can be easily inserted (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in FIGS. <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> 6) Glass Substrate </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> As shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is tightly pressed on the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to provide a space in which a liquid is held, thereby enabling the observation of cells passing through the channels. Thus, the glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> should remain optically transparent and flat and provide a plane to which cells can adhere. Use can be made therefor of glass as well as plastics such as transparent acrylic resins, so long as the above objects can be achieved thereby. Although its thickness is not particularly restricted so long as no strain arises in the step of pressing onto the substrate, the thickness adequately ranges from 0.7 to 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> 7) Arrangement of Multiplicity of Units </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> By referring a plural number of wells connected to each other each via a channel as a single unit, a plural number of units may be arranged and integrated on a single substrate. Thus, an apparatus whereby a large number of specimens can be treated at the same time can be obtained. Units of the same type may be arranged in parallel or units of different types may be arranged. Next, the types of the arrangement and integration will be described by reference to respective figures. However, it is to be understood that the present invention is not construed as being restricted thereto and thus various combinations may be also employed depending on the purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows an example wherein <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> well units each having a couple of wells connected via a channel as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are mounted on a square substrate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (16 mm&times;16 mm). In this example, the units are each 5.7 mm in the major sides and 1.2 mm in the minor sides and located at intervals of 0.8 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows an example of an integration of multiplicity of integrated units. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, each of quadrilaterals A<highlight><subscript>1-4</subscript></highlight>, B<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>1-4 </subscript></highlight>corresponds to the integration shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In this case, the arrays A, B and C are integrations of units of different types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows an example wherein independent double system units are integrated circularly. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the unit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> along the dashed and dotted line. Concerning the size, for example, the width of wells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B in the radial direction is 1.5 mm, the width of a channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the redial direction is 0.5 mm and the width of grooves<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formed in the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is 10 &mgr;m. In this case, the radius of the whole unit is 5.0 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> shows an example wherein 12 units of the type shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> are integrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In such a case of integrating multiplicity of units, a single block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a single glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be used so as to cover the whole unit (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows an example of the fabrication of an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells and separating chemotactic cells comprising multiplicity of units integrated together. A substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having multiplicity of units integrated thereon, a packing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; and a block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> covering them are placed between a cover cap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and an intermediate base <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A glass substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is placed between the intermediate base <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a bottom base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and fastened with screws. The locations of the block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are specified by the intermediate base <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and fixed by guide pins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and guide pin receiver holes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> provided at the bottom face of the block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be directly pressed and fixed to the block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, it is also possible that a substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a single unit (i.e., a couple of wells and a channel) is used as a substitute for the integrated unit and a plural number of the fabricated units are arranged at definite intervals. In this case, units can be successively exchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> 8) Automatic Controlling System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Next, the automatic controlling system in the microsample treatment apparatus according to the present invention will be illustrated in detail by reference to an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells as an example. However, it is needless to say that this illustration is given merely by way of example and various embodiments may be further employed for achieving the automation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows an example of the automatic controlling system of the apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells according to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27, U</cross-reference> represents a unit part, C represents a cell reservoir, S represents a specimen reservoir and W represents a pipette washing part. The line X-X&prime; shows an example of the flow line of a plural number of specimen supply pipettes (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in this case) aligned laterally, while the line Y-Y&prime; shows an example of the flow line of a plural number of cell supply pipettes aligned laterally. The unit part U is set at the pipette flow line position and a space provided above the top ends of each unit is filled up with a liquid. Cells are held in the cell reservoir, while various specimens are held in the specimen reservoir S. Liquid level control pipettes aligned laterally are located above the unit part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and the flow line thereof is indicated by, for example, Z-Z&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. Each pipette is moved, for example, as follows, though it is needless to say that the present invention is not restricted thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> A definite amount of a cell suspension is sucked from the cell reservoir C by a cell supply pipette. Then the pipette moves along the flow line Y-Y&prime; to the unit part U and supplies the cell suspension into the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A of each unit through a cell supply tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A. Subsequently, the cell supply pipette returns to the position C and stops the operation, or moves to supply the cell suspension to the next unit. Since cells are precipitated owing to the gravity, it is favorable to stir the cell suspension contained in the cell-reserving container <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> immediately before collecting the cells by sucking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Next, the liquid in the space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in each unit is sucked by a liquid level control pipette and thus the liquid level is lowered to the position II, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> shows. Subsequently, a definite amount of the liquid is further sucked so as to adjust the position of cells in the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. Then the liquid level control pipette is elevated to the liquid level I position or higher and the sucked liquid is discharged at any point on the flow line Z-Z, thereby returning the liquid level in the space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the position I. Subsequently, the liquid level control pipette is further elevated and stops its operation, or moves on the next unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Then a definite amount of a specimen is sucked from the specimen reservoir S by a specimen supply pipette. The specimen supply pipette moves along the flow line X-X&prime; to the unit part U and supplies the specimen into the well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B through a specimen supply tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B. Subsequently, the specimen supply pipette moves along the flow line X-X&prime; to the pipette washing part W wherein it is washed by repeatedly sucking and discharging a washing liquor in a washing tank. Then the pipette is elevated above the liquid level in the washing tank and stops its operation, or moves to the next unit part U to supply the specimen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Next, the unit part U having the cell suspension and the specimen thus supplied moves in the direction indicated by an arrow &rarr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> and stops at the position where the channel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> agrees with the detection part. Thus, the conditions of the cells are detected and recorded. As the unit part U moves, the next unit part U comes to the position of the pipette flow line and thus the above operations are repeated. It is also possible to move the unit part U together with the specimen reservoir S. In this case, the unit part U and the specimen reservoir S moves together and thus the next unit part U and the next specimen reservoir S come to the pipette flow line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The cell reservoir C is provided with containers for temporarily holding cells to be supplied into the unit part U. These containers may be in any shape, so long as they can play the desired role. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> shows an example of the containers in the cell reservoir C. A plural number of cell containers <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are provide,d corresponding to the arrangement of each unit and a plural number of the cell supply pipettes. In the example shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, an inclined injection part <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed to facilitate the injection of cells into each container and avoid waste of cells. It is preferable to further provide an inlet part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> so that the cell suspension can be easily introduced into the containers without waste. By using this structure, the cell suspension injected at an arbitrary point can be supplied into all containers, thereby saving a lot of time and labor for injecting the cell suspension into individual cells. It is also preferable that the cell containers <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are tapered at the bottom so as to avoid waste of the cell suspension in the step of sucking by the pipettes. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is a perspective view; (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is a top plan view; (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is a sectional view along the dotted line A-A&prime; in (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>); and (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is another sectional view along the dotted line B-B&prime; in (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The specimen reservoir S is provided with containers for temporarily holding a specimen to be supplied into the unit part U. These containers may be in any shape, so long as they can play the desired role. In case of supplying many types of specimens into the unit part U, use is frequently made of a method wherein individual specimens are manually injected into the containers in the specimen reservoir S with the use of micropipettes, etc. In such a case, it is preferable to provide pipette tip inlet ports <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> having a diameter larger than the pore size of the opening of the containers, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. It is also desirable that the containers are tapered at the bottom to lessen the specimen remaining therein after taking out from the containers, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is a perspective view; (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is a sectional view; and (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is a top plan view. In the example shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the pipette tip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is inserted into the container <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the pipette tip inlet port <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in the step of manually injecting a specimen. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> shows an example wherein a plural number of specimen containers are located along the flow line X-X&prime; of the specimen supply pipette. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> shows, the inlet ports may be alternately located so that the intervals among the containers can be adjusted fit to the intervals among the units in the unit part U. The specimen containers may have a square shape, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> shows an example wherein a plural number of specimen containers are located along the flow line X-X&prime; of the specimen supply pipettes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In the pipettes to be used in the apparatus according to the present invention, suction and discharge of liquids can be controlled by computerized programming. It is preferable to use a pipette having a multichannel syringe as shown by FIG. <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The needle (tip) of the pipette may be made of glass, a metal, a plastic material, etc. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is a top plan view; and (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is a side plan view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The detection means to be used in the present invention may be any means so long as cells which are passing through a channel or have passed therethrough can be detected thereby. If necessary, it involves a means of recording the detection data. Any means known as a means of detecting and recording cells is usable therefor. Use can be made of, for example, a microscope optionally combined with a video camera. It is also possible to employ a system having an objective lens provided with a CCD camera. For the detection in integrated units, it is preferable to employ a system wherein the channels of the units are successively scanned along with an objective lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> As shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the detection means is usually provided in a channel of a unit. In an apparatus having multiplicity of units integrated together, it is also possible to employ a system wherein arrays of the units successively come to a detection part located at a definite position for detection and recording. In this case, the channels of the aligned units are scanned with the detector. Either one or more scanning detectors may be employed. Owing to this constitution, a relatively small number of detectors suffice for the detection in multiplicity of integrated units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Cells which are passing or have passed through a channel can be detected and counted by directly observing the cells with a microscope. Alternatively, the detection and counting can be easily performed by preliminarily labeling the cells with a luminous or fluorescent substance and then capturing the luminescence or fluorescence in a conventional manner. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> According to the structure of the present invention, it is possible to, in the step of injecting a liquid sample into a well, prevent the migration of the sample into another well or overflow thereof. Moreover, the position of the injected sample can be adjusted in a well or the sample can be transferred into the next well under controlling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The structure according to the present invention achieves a remarkable technical merit and widely applicable particularly in cases of handling samples in microquantities such as solutions and cell suspensions, or separating cells or particles depending on size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> A high technical merit can be established by applying the structure of the present invention to an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or an apparatus for separating cells with the use of cell chemotaxis. That is to say, unexpected migration of a sample caused by pressure changes in the step of injecting/sucking samples such as cells and specimen solutions can be prevented thereby. Furthermore, unexpected migration of a sample caused by horizontal off balance of the apparatus can be prevented. Thus, movements of cells by their own actions can be accurately understood or desired cells can be taken out. Namely, it is possible to obtain results affected by both of the effect of a chemotactic factor or an inhibitor and the characteristics of the cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In the apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or the apparatus for separating cells with the use of cell chemotaxis according to the present invention, a bank is formed in a channel located between wells or barriers constituting definite grooves are formed on the bank or, alternatively, a gap is formed between a plane provided on the upper face of the bank and a glass substrate. Owing to this structure, it becomes possible to easily establish the state wherein cells are brought together in the vicinity of the channel and aligned in the flow direction of the cells, when a cell suspension is put into one well and an adequate amount of a liquid is sucked from the other well. As a result, the presence/absence of the cell chemotaxis can be accurately detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The structure according to the present invention makes it possible to downsize the apparatus. When applied to an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells or separating chemotactic cells, namely, samples can be used in an amount {fraction (1/50)} to {fraction (1/1000)} times as much in the conventional cases with the use of a Boyden chamber. That is to say, biological samples (whole blood, etc.) per se are usable as samples in the apparatus of the present invention. By using whole blood as a sample, for example, measurement can be made by using 0.1 &mgr;l of blood in case of detecting the chemotaxis of neutrophils and about 1 &mgr;l of blood in case eosinophils, monocytes or basophils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In the structure according to the present invention, moreover, no delicate control is needed in the step of injecting a liquid, which brings about an additional merit that the apparatus can be easily automated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The unit of the apparatus according to the present invention can be in a microsize and thus multiplicity of the units can be integrated together, which brings about another merit that an apparatus whereby a large number of samples can be simultaneously treated can be fabricated. In this case, an apparatus having an automated system of injecting and detecting liquids can be easily fabricated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> In integrating multiplicity of units, detection and separation for different purposes can be simultaneously carried out by combining and integrating units of different types together. Thus, the treatment efficiency can be elevated. In case of an apparatus for detecting chemotaxis of cells, for example, the detection of various chemotactic factors or inhibitors for a single type of cells or the detection of the chemotaxis of different types of cells for a single chemotactic factor can be carried out at once. </paragraph>
