<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an adjustment and locking device, particularly suitable for use in ski bindings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Known types of ski binding are currently in use which are constituted by a toe unit and a heel unit which are associated in a downward region, by virtue of known types of connecting and fixing means such as screws, bolts, brackets and guides, with a ski or with engagement elements which are in turn associated with said ski. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Said heel unit and toe unit are constituted for example respectively by a front jaw and a rear jaw which, together with suitable automatic devices, temporarily lock the tip and heel of the ski boot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> These known types of ski binding are adjustable according to shoe size by allowing to move generally the heel unit longitudinally with respect to the ski; this can be achieved by virtue of adjustment means of the screw-and-rack type, as shown for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,422, in which the longitudinal movement of the heel unit is actuated by means of a screw which is arranged below said heel unit and engages a rack arranged on the surface of the ski. A continuous adjustment of the size can be achieved with this device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another example of device for performing an adjustment, in this case of the discrete type, is described in DE-A-4,041,402 or in EP-A-0,729,770, in which adjustment is achieved by disengaging a pawl rigidly coupled to the heel unit from a rack rigidly coupled to the ski, by moving longitudinally the heel unit along appropriately provided guides, by repositioning it in the new position and reengaging the pawl with the rack in order to lock said heel unit in the new selected position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Since these adjustments entail the movement of the heel unit with respect to the toe unit, which is fixed, they displace the center of gravity of the user with respect to the position of the ski, consequently varying the balance of the skier during skiing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> All known ski types, and in particular recently designed ones, are built so that they have to be used conveniently with a very specific position of the ski boot with respect to said ski. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the main drawback of these known types of adjustment device is the fact that said adjustment must be performed within small movements of the heel unit toward the tail of the ski, since an excessive movement would cause an equally excessive displacement of the center of gravity of the user, with consequent difficulty in skiing and a reduction in safety conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> DE-2,246,668 partially solves the above described drawbacks and discloses a ski binding formed by a toe unit and a heel unit provided with a mechanism for the simultaneous adjustment of the longitudinal position of the toe unit and of the heel unit; said mechanism comprises two connecting elements, one connected to the toe unit and one connected to the heel unit, which are in turn mutually connected by means of an adjustment device which is composed of a rack-and-pinion system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The user may adjust the position of the toe unit and the heel unit is adjusted by actuating the adjustment device which, by virtue of the pinion, acts simultaneously on the two racks, moving the toe unit and the heel unit in mutually opposite directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> During adjustment, these mechanisms transmit the longitudinal motion to the toe unit and heel unit according to a given ratio which is substantially constant with respect to a reference plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the ski. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One drawback of the above devices is that the adjustment mechanisms are not universally usable for any type of binding but can be applied only to dedicated bindings interfaced with the adjustment mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the above described adjustment devices comprise devices for locking the adjustment mechanisms usually constituted, for example, by rotating knobs provided in a lower region with a mechanism for actuating the pinion and therefore the racks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The knob can partially slide axially so as to interact selectively with the pinion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The partial sliding of the knob along an axial direction is preferably allowed, for example, in contrast with an elastically deformable element such as a spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The spring is normally suitable to keep the knob in a position in which it does not interact with the pinion, so as to allow to use the sports implement to practice skiing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> If adjustment of the binding is required, one acts by moving the knob axially in contrast with the spring so as to allow connection to the pinion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> After turning the knob and therefore completing the adjustment, the spring restores the skiing position, uncoupling the pinion from the mechanism for actuating it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another manner, the locking and temporary unlocking of the adjustment device can be achieved by virtue of the interaction between first inclined planes, arranged perimetrically to the knob, in a helical pattern, and second inclined planes formed on an element which is rigidly coupled to the adjustment device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this manner, a rotation of the knob produces the simultaneous axial movement thereof, thus allowing coupling and uncoupling with respect to the pinion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The main drawback of the above temporary locking devices is that, during sports practice, and therefore when binding adjustment is not allowed, play occurs among the components of the rack-and-pinion system due to the considerable forces generated during skiing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> This play can lead to a locking of the toe unit and heel unit which is not effective and therefore dangerously unstable, with a substantial reduction in level of safety during skiing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> DE-2,001,929 discloses a ski binding which comprises a front supporting element, arranged so that it can be adjusted lengthwise on a first base element fixed to the ski, and a rear supporting element, arranged so that it can be adjusted lengthwise on an additional base element which is fixed to the ski, and also comprises an adjustment device in the form of a rack-and-pinion mechanism for the simultaneous adjustment of both supporting elements. Between the supporting elements there are two racks respectively connected to a supporting element and a pinion which meshes with both racks, the racks can be activated manually and can be locked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> This solution is characterized in that the pinion has a fixed locking position on the ski and in that the racks are arranged so that they can be orientated about an axis which lies transversely to the ski in the region where meshing with the pinion occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The above system still has drawbacks, such as a large number of components, whose mutual interaction requires very limited plays and, accordingly, owing to the considerable stresses applied to the ski, can lead to possible malfunctions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the pinion has a position, which is raised vertically with respect to the upper part of the ski and allows its rotation, and a locking position, which is compressed against the upper part of the ski. This requires, together with the presence of a pinion activation lever located on a plane which is approximately parallel to the plane of arrangement of said pinion, a considerable overall thickness of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Finally, the complexity of the individual components and the particular shape of the lever, which interacts with the racks along an axis which is inclined with respect to them, and at the opposite ends, makes the mechanism prone to jamming or sticking during temporary coupling to the racks. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The locking device, constituted by the first and second pawls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, is opened by acting on the lever <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in contrast with the elastically deformable element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and by then turning the pawls into the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, so as to uncouple the first and second sets of teeth <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from the upper pinion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> At the same time, the elastically deformable element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is loaded so that when the tab <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is pressed, the first and second pawls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>close and clamp their respective sets of teeth onto the upper pinion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Since the elastically deformable element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preloaded, in this position, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an elastic force is generated which is suitable to maintain the locking of the pair of pinions, avoiding accidental openings of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates the wire spring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which cooperates with the first and second pawls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, above which it is possible to arrange a protective element, not shown, which is optionally associable with the central body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so as to stiffen the entire structure and better protect it against any damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The operation of the device is therefore as follows: with reference to the above cited figures, the user can adjust the distance between the toe unit and the heel unit by turning the lever <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, thus activating the adjustment and locking device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As a consequence of the rotation of the lever <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the first and second pawls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are turned outward and thus disengage from the upper pinion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, releasing the mechanism <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the toe unit and the heel unit, coupled in a lower region to the first and second plates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, are free to move in opposite directions along the longitudinal axis of the ski. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The sliding of the toe unit and of the heel unit along the first and second ends of the third plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is performed manually by the user by virtue of a simple pressure, in the appropriate direction, on either the toe and heel units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Once the intended adjustment has been achieved, in order to lock the adjustment device it is sufficient to act on the tab <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, returning the lever <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to the original position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) and thus restoring the connection between the first and second sets of teeth <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the pawls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the upper pinion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> It has thus been found that the invention has achieved the intended aim and objects, an adjustment and locking device having been provided which allows to modify easily, rapidly and continuously the position of the toe unit and heel unit of a ski binding without altering the position of the foot and body of the user with respect to the center of gravity of the ski. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The device according to the invention is compatible with any kind of commercially available ski binding, since it is independent of the shape of the toe unit and heel unit. Moreover, the adjustment and locking device is highly rigid, by virtue of its very shape, having negligible oscillations or plays of the toe unit and heel unit during skiing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the fact that the device according to the invention, composed of a fixed plate and sliding plates, has been entrusted with the function of adjusting the shoe size of the binding, in addition to the traditional function of supporting the binding, allows to keep the flexural capabilities of the ski substantially unchanged, because the binding and all its adjustments are transferred from the central region of the ski to the plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The device according to the invention is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Thus, for example, it is possible to provide a device in which the connecting elements <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged above the pawls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and, accordingly, the upper pinion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a smaller diameter than the lower pinion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Also, the shape of the second pivot <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be different from the described one, particularly in the region between the sixth end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the prism-shaped region <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, so long as the free rotation of the second pivot with respect to the central body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is allowed and the rotation of said pivot with respect to the lever <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the first pawl <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The materials used, as well as the dimensions that constitute the individual components of the invention, may of course be the most pertinent according to specific requirements. </paragraph>
