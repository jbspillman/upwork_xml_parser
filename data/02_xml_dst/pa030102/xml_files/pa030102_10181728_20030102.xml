<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a head drum device for performing either or both of writing and reading of a signal to and from a magnetic tape and to a magnetic recording/playback apparatus including this head drum device. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a head drum device having a three-layered structure in which an intermediate drum is rotatable and also to a magnetic recording/playback apparatus including this head drum device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, video tape recorders have come into widespread use as magnetic recording/playback apparatuses using magnetic tape as a recording medium. In video tape recorders, a helical scan method, in which recording or playback of a signal is performed by helically winding a magnetic tape around a head drum device which is provided with a rotatable magnetic head on its circumference, is commonly used. The head drum device used in such video tape recorders is generally of two types: one having a two-layered structure including a fixed lower drum and a rotatable upper drum having a magnetic head; the other having a three-layered structure including a fixed lower drum, a rotatable intermediate drum having a magnetic head, and a fixed upper drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an example of the configuration of a conventional three-layered head drum device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a side view of a conventional head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a three-layered structure. The head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a fixed lower drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, an intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> rotatable coaxially with the lower drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and an upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> fixed coaxially with the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The lower drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided with a lead <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>around its circumference for assisting the helically wound magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to travel. A motor mechanism and associated parts for rotating and driving the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are contained within the lower drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, on the circumference of the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, magnetic heads <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for writing or reading a signal to and from the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are mounted. In practice, a plurality of (two or four) magnetic heads <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is usually mounted. A rotary transformer or the like serving as a signal transmission path between the magnetic head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an external device is accommodated within the upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While a recording or playback operation is performed on the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in such a head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is guided by the lead <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and travels while being wound around the circumference of the head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at a predetermined angle. At this time, the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is rotated and the magnetic head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>scans the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at an angle, thus performing writing and reading of signals. The upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> also serves to prevent the traveling magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from being displaced upwardly to cover the head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the three-layered head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the axial length of the rotatable intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is smaller than the width of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is wound around three layers, that is, the lower drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. In contrast, in a head drum device having a two-layered structure including a fixed lower drum and a rotatable upper drum, the axial length of the upper drum is substantially equal to the width of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Such a two-layered head drum device may be provided with a tape guide above the upper drum to prevent the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from covering the upper drum, thus often having an apparent three-layered structure. However, the structure of this type is also called a two-layered structure here. On the other hand, the structure in which the axial length of the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is smaller than the width of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is called a three-layered structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A specific example of the head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a three-layered structure is shown in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 10-340504 which discloses a head drum device with good contact characteristics between the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the magnetic head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In the head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, rotating the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at high speed while a recording or playback operation is performed causes air to be sucked in by the force of rotation to form an air film between the outer peripheral surface and the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This air film allows the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to travel smoothly. However, this air film tends to have a thickness distribution such that it is thicker at an entry side of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and thinner at an exit side thereof. In such a case, the contact pressure between the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the magnetic head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is not uniform, so that accurate writing and reading of a signal to and from the magnetic tape are prevented. On the other hand, in the above-mentioned publication, such a problem is solved by bonding a belt-like metallic thin film on the lower drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the side where the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> exits to form a projection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a three-layered structure, in the course of using a tape cassette that feeds the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for example, the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be charged with static electricity so that the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attracted to the head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and clings to it when this tape cassette is loaded. If the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> travels in such a condition, a sufficient air film cannot be generated between the outer peripheral surface of the head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which may cause the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be damaged. Particularly, in the head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a three-layered structure, as described above, since the axial length of the circumference of the rotatable intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is small, a sufficient air film fails to be generated when the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> travels. Accordingly, the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is prone to cling to the head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the conventional head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a three-layered structure has prevented electrostatic charge by using a non-magnetic metal, such as an aluminum alloy or a copper alloy, as the material of the upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Further, in the conventional head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a three-layered structure, the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has been formed in such a manner that its outside diameter is equal to that of the upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and the friction resistance has been restricted by making the surface on which the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> travels smooth. Also, in order to prevent the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from being damaged when it is in contact with the outer peripheral surface of the upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the surface of the upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> has been manufactured using the metallic material mentioned-above formed with a precision of &plusmn;2 &mgr;m. However, since manufacture of the upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> described above requires expensive materials, processing, equipment, and so on, use of a synthetic resin material whose cost is relatively low has been discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, the upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> made of a synthetic resin has high resistance so that static electricity is likely to be charged, and therefore the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is prone to cling to the upper drum. Further, the manufacturing precision of the surface dimensions is largely reduced in injection molding of synthetic resin material, comparing with that of metallic material. Accordingly, since further reduction of the outside diameter by machining is necessary in order to obtain a manufacturing precision falling within the range of &plusmn;2 &mgr;m that is required when manufacturing the upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, it is impossible to reduce the manufacturing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in a magnetic recording/playback apparatus including the head drum device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, when any stains or dust is attached on the outer peripheral surface of the upper drum <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the surface of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be damaged. Thus, actions such as mounting parts for removing such stains or dust, managing the manufacturing process so as to prevent such stains or dust from being attached, cleaning, and so on have been required during the manufacturing process. As a result, the manufacturing costs have increased due to the increased number of manufacturing processes, additional equipment, and material costs for chemical agents such as alcohol used for cleaning, which are necessary for such actions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention is provided in order to solve such problems and an object of the present invention is to provide a head drum device having reduced manufacturing cost for the upper drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic recording/playback apparatus provided with a head drum device having reduced manufacturing cost for the upper drum. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> While a recording or playback operation is performed on the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in such a head drum device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is guided by the lead <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and travels while being wound around the circumference of the head drum device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a predetermined angle. At this time, the intermediate drum is rotated and the magnetic head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>scans the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at an angle, thus performing writing and reading of signals. Further, as described above, because the axial length of the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is smaller than the width of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> travels while being wound around three layers, that is, the lower drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In this head drum device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is made of a synthetic resin containing carbon. The fact that it contains carbon gives the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> conductivity, thus suppressing electrostatic charge. In the magnetic recording/playback apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for example, is likely to be charged with static electricity during use. If the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is charged with static electricity due to such a reason, the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may cling together, thus hampering smooth travel of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, because synthetic resins do not normally have conductivity, the present invention can avoid electrostatic charge by including carbon in the resin. Therefore, the value of the surface resistance of the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> formed is usually 1015 &OHgr; or less and the carbon content is 10 percent by weight or more. Examples of synthetic resins used include polycarbonate, ABS (acrilonitrile-butadiene-styrene) resin, and POM (polyoxymethylene). A carbon content of 30 percent by weight may be optimal from the viewpoint of conductive performance and cost in currently distributed products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce manufacturing costs compared with conventional devices, the head drum device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> using such materials is desirably manufactured only by means of injection molding without subsequent processing. However, since the manufacturing precision achieved by means of injection molding of the above-mentioned synthetic resin is around &plusmn;10-20 &mgr;m, the required level of manufacturing precision is not provided when the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed so as to have the same diameter. Accordingly, in the head drum device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the present invention, the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed in such a manner that its outside diameter is smaller than that of the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, the present invention can realize reduced manufacturing cost by intentionally decreasing the outside diameter of the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> so as to decrease the required manufacturing precision to the level available in injection molding of synthetic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of the portion encircled by A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, while a recording or playback operation is performed on the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the head drum device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, traveling of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and rotation of the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> cause air to be sucked in between both the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to form an air film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Further, the head drum device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed in such a manner that the outer peripheral surface of the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> recedes inwardly from that of the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by the amount of a step d, that is, the radius of the circumference of the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is smaller than that of the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by the amount d. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, any stains or dust attached on the surface of the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may attach onto the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during stopping or operating, which results in the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> clinging to the head drum device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, thereby causing obstructing the travel of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Such clinging of the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is likely to occur when the step d between the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is 10 &mgr;m or less. Moreover, formation of the air film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> mentioned above allows the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to travel smoothly and to come into contact with the magnetic head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at an appropriate pressure. However, it is more desirable that the step d between the outer peripheral surface of the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and that of the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> does not exceed 100 &mgr;m in order to sufficiently form the air film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an appropriate value of the step d is not less than 10 &mgr;m and preferably falls within the range from 10 to 100 &mgr;m. Considering the manufacturing precision of synthetic resin by injection molding, when the target value for the step d formed is set to around 50 to 60 &mgr;m, it becomes possible to easily form the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> using synthetic resin materials containing carbon, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the head drum device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the present invention, use of synthetic resin with a carbon content of 10 percent by weight or more as the material of the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can prevent the head drum device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from clinging together due to electrostatic charge, thus considerably reducing the cost of the material. Also, setting the radius of the outer peripheral surface of the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> smaller than that of the intermediate drum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by an amount of 10 to 100 &mgr;m eliminates the need for a high-level of manufacturing precision in the manufacture of the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Moreover, such setting also can reduce the possibility that any stains or dust attached on the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be transferred to the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that the need for a process or mechanism for removing such stains or dust is eliminated. Thus, the upper drum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be manufactured using materials mentioned above by injection molding, so that the need for high-precision processing machines can be eliminated to reduce the cost of equipment and also to reduce the cost of manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a device including the head drum device of the present invention is not limited to a video tape recorder. The present invention can be applied to all helical-scan-type magnetic recording apparatuses and magnetic playback apparatuses using a magnetic tape as a recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the head drum device of the present invention, use of carbon-containing synthetic resin as the material of the upper drum can prevent the magnetic tape from clinging to the head drum device due to electrostatic charge. Also, setting the outside diameter of the upper drum smaller than that of the intermediate drum eliminates the need for a high-level of manufacturing precision in the manufacture of the upper drum. Thus, it is possible to reduce the manufacturing cost for the upper drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Also, in the magnetic recording/playback apparatus of the present invention, use of carbon-containing synthetic resin as the material of the upper drum of the head drum device can prevent the magnetic tape from clinging to the head drum device due to electrostatic charge. Also, setting the outside diameter of the upper drum smaller than that of the intermediate drum eliminates the need for a high-level of manufacturing precision in the manufacture of the upper drum. Thus, it is possible to reduce the manufacturing cost for the upper drum. </paragraph>
