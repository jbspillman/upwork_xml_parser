<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A switchgear, for low-voltage switching units with a linearly-displaceable contact support, includes a case-like housing with guide grooves, running in the direction of travel of the contact support, in the housing side walls thereof. Suitable projections on the side of the contact support, engage in the grooves, whereby the linear travel of the contact support is achieved. Pivoting contacts are arranged on the contact support as displaceable switch contacts. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a switching pole for low-voltage switchgear having a linearly movable contact support for a movable switching contact, which interacts with a fixed-position switching contact which is mounted on a connecting rail, and having a drive apparatus for the movable contact support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Switchgear having a switching pole of this type are described, by way of example, in DE 12 50 532 B or DE 18 14 550 C1. These are contactors. The idea of the invention, in contrast, is to develop a new powerful physical form for a different type of low-voltage switchgear, namely circuit breakers. Specific features of contactors, which appear to be advantageous, cannot, however, be used without problems in circuit breakers, as will be described in more detail in the following text. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Low-voltage circuit breakers comprise a number of assemblies which are matched to the different task elements and are connected to one another during production of the circuit breakers. The largest assemblies, or units, in this case form the switching poles, that is to say the contact systems (which are composed of stationary and removable switching contacts) with their supporting insulation and the drive apparatus, which is shared by a number of such contact systems). In this case, the movement sequences which are provided by the drive apparatus are transmitted to the contact systems via a switching shaft which is mounted in a fixed position. For this purpose, the switching shaft, which is mounted such that it can rotate and can be pivoted through a specific angle by means of a spring store or some other switch drive, is provided with levers which originate from this switching shaft and continue further, via which the individual switching poles, or movable contacts which are arranged on contact supports, are operated. Contact supports such as these have until now generally been mounted in low-voltage circuit breakers such that they can pivot. This results in a relatively high physical shape, with effects on the physical height of the switch enclosure, and in a relatively complicated design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such conventional configurations of lever arrangements for transmission of the drive force for low-voltage circuit breakers are described, by way of example, in DE-C 44 16 088 and in EP Patent Application 0 225 207. In the case of contact supports which have a number of parallel contact levers, assembled structures, which can be pivoted by means of a shaft, have always been used until now, in which a body is used only to hold the contact levers, and side walls or levers, generally in the form of metal parts, have been attached to this body at the side, by means of screw connections or in some other way, with these then representing the mounting of the contact support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A movable contact support of this type has been disclosed in DE 35 39 786 A1. Here, the bearing arms are a component of a bearing bracket, whose dimensions are matched to a holding body for the contact levers. This is a structure comprising a number of metal parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Movable contact supports are also known which are assembled from a combination of plastic moldings and metal parts. For example, DE-296 15 556 U describes a movable switching contact arrangement for a low-voltage circuit breaker with contact levers and with a contact lever support which holds the contact levers and is mounted by means of bearing arms at the side such that it can pivot for connection and disconnection. This contact lever support has a center part, which comprises a base body and at least one additional body which can be attached to this base body, with the bearing arms being mounted on the center part, on both sides. Both the movable contact supports which have been mentioned are assembled in a conventional manner from a number of individual components. Furthermore, parasitic voltages can occur in the case of supporting arms composed of metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The contactors which were mentioned initially have contact supports which move in straight lines. These are connected to an armature of a drive magnet and contain bridge contacts with associated contact force springs. However, this is completely unusual for circuit breakers. Contact links which have become known for circuit breakers have considerable problems (quite apart from other difficulties that are still to be mentioned) with regard to the dissipation of the switching gases. Although two disconnection points can allow a higher switching rating, two switching chambers are required, by way of example, from which it is necessary to provide dissipation of the switching gases. Particularly in the case of high switching ratings, the primary problem is the dissipation of the switching gases for the second disconnection point. If the contact link is arranged vertically, there are difficulties with the course of the arc, since the switch components are located above the disconnection point. The lower arcing chamber therefore cannot be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> If the contact link is arranged horizontally, there is a problem in dissipating the switching gases on one side, since this would have to be done to the side on which, in the case of the circuit breakers, their peripheral devices, such as auxiliary and signaling devices, are located. This is extremely disadvantageous. If the switching gases are dissipated to the side, the distances to the side walls of the inset frame are also too small. Furthermore, the guidance of the busbars with respect to the contacts when the contact link is arranged horizontally results in considerable problems. This means that a vertical arrangement of the contacts represents the best solution, although, as has already been stated above, this cannot be achieved using a contact link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another problem is that the arrangement with a contact link is mechanically unstable. There is no certainty as to which contacts of the link will open first, that is to say where the greater erosion will occur. Considerable technical complexity is involved in designing such contact links reliably, with regard to the contact forces or the simultaneous opening of both contacts. The arrangement of two arcing chambers also represents not inconsiderable additional complexity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the case of low-voltage circuit breakers, particularly in the case of devices with a high switching rating, the geometry of the switching pole must be maintained as precisely as possible in order to avoid overdesigning in widely different ways, and in order to ensure correct operation. This includes exactly ensuring the penetration to achieve the necessary contact force, the contact opening and other parameters. However, this is not feasible with contact links, as has been described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Leading and main contacts are required in order to cope with the switching rating, as is disclosed by way of example in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in U.S. Pat. No. 3,585,329, which illustrate the profile of the contact movement during disconnection of a switch. In this case, it can be seen that the main contact opens first followed by the auxiliary contact, which means that the disconnection arc is transferred from the auxiliary contact to a dissipation lug. This avoids arc formation on the main contact and prevents the main contact from being worn by contact erosion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This sequence of a switching process can also be found in EP-PS 0325 767 B1, in particular in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> there. Although this describes a connection process, it is nonetheless clear that the procedure for disconnection takes place in the opposite sequence. Here, too, it can be seen that the erosion of the main contact is avoided by later opening of the contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> From the problems which have been described, it can be seen that a linearly movable contact support with contact links, as is normal for contactors, cannot be used for low-voltage circuit breakers. In addition to the risk of contact opening as a result of electrodynamic forces, the disadvantage is that only one contact link per pole and, possibly one three-pole contact link support for three contact links per operating rod are feasible, while circuit breakers have individual poles, three or four poles of which can be joined together, depending on the size of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In consequence, the object of the invention is to design a switching pole of the type mentioned initially such that it is suitable in particular for low-voltage switchgear and has characteristics that have been worked out for this purpose, in comparison to the previously normal physical form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the switching pole comprises a box-shaped enclosure, through whose enclosure rear wall the connecting rail, which is provided with the fixed position switching contact, is inserted, and through whose enclosure rear wall a further connecting rail is also passed, by means of which a pivoting contact, which is arranged on the contact support and is mounted on a shaft, is connected via a flexible conductor as a movable switching contact, and in that interacting guidance means for linearly moving guidance of the contact support are arranged in the switching pole on opposite walls of the switching pole and on the movable contact support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention surprisingly combines the advantages of linearly movable contact supports and contact levers which are arranged such that they can pivot. It furthermore results in the switching pole being suitable for any type of operation, in particular even linearly acting drives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> US 3 614 680 has already, per se, disclosed a switching pole for a contactor with a box-shaped enclosure, connecting rails which project from it and a pivoting contact. In contrast to the switching pole according to the invention, the pivoting contact is, however, mounted in the enclosure of the switching pole, that is to say there is no separate contact support. This necessitates the armature of the drive magnet being guided with a considerable amount of play in order to allow a connection to the switching contact, which can move in the form of a circular arc. The linear guidance for the contact support in the switching pole according to the invention can be designed such that the enclosure side walls of the switching pole have guide grooves in the movement direction of the contact support, and suitable projections are provided on the sides of the contact support, for sliding in these guide grooves. Furthermore, for the purposes of the invention, the contact support may advantageously be in the form of a plastic molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The projections on the sides of the contact support may also be in the form of continuous ribs which run in the movement direction of the contact support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The movable switching contacts, which are arranged on the contact support, are mounted on a shaft and are in the form of pivoting contacts which are known per se, are supported by means of contact force springs on the contact support, and have conventional leading contacts, which interact with corresponding mating contacts on the stationary switching contacts, in order to reduce the erosion of the main contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The contact support is moved in a known manner by a conventional switch drive via an operating element, so that no new technologies, or the complexity associated with them, are required. However, the contact support can be moved in a straight line, and this can be achieved relatively easily by means of a physically simple technical configuration and is, of course, particularly highly suitable for a linearly acting drive, such as a magnet drive. Configuration of the contact support in the form of a plastic part avoids parasitic voltages, which can occur due to the metal parts on conventional contact supports that can pivot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention proposes the combination of a pivoting contact, with all its advantages in a low voltage circuit breaker, with a linearly movable switch drive, with its advantages. This means that the conventional highly advantageous arrangement of the connecting rails can be retained while, nevertheless, the advantages of a linearly moving system, with regard to the drive and guidance, can be made use of.</paragraph>

The switching pole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a box-shaped enclosure through which enclosure rear wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> the upper connecting rails <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are inserted, and on which the stationary switching contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are arranged.

Guide grooves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are provided in the enclosure side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in order to hold projections <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which are arranged on the linearly movable contact support <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and by means of which the contact support <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be moved linearly in the enclosure of the switching pole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, guided by the guide grooves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The contact support is in the form of a plastic molding and is fitted with the movable switching contacts <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which are mounted on a shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, are in the form of pivoting contacts, are supported by means of contact force springs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the contact support <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and, in the conventional way, have leading contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which interact with mating contacts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the stationary switching contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, in order to reduce the erosion of the main contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The contact support <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is moved via an operating element <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by a switch drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (which is illustrated schematically) in the conventional manner. This operating element <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> results in the contact support <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being moved in the direction of the arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, linearly toward the stationary switching contact <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, until the movable switching contacts <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> come into contact with the stationary switching contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the connected state is reached, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The contact support is moved back to the disconnected position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, by moving the operating element <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a switching pole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for a low-voltage circuit breaker with a linearly movable contact support <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, illustrated in perspective form with the rear wall removed. Guide grooves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are provided in the side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in which guide grooves the contact support <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is guided by means of the projection <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in order to produce a linear movement, as has been described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The movable switching contacts <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which are in the form of switching contacts which can pivot, are arranged on the contact support <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and are connected by means of flexible conductor cables <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the lower connecting rail <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is not illustrated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The advantage of the solution according to the invention is that the advantages of a linear movement of the contact support can be combined with the advantages of applicability to the pivoting contacts which have been proven in practice and are in the form of a main contact and a leading contact. Furthermore, the space requirement for a linearly movable contact support is less, and its physical design is considerable simpler. In addition, the arc splitters for the arc quenching chambers are not matched to the path of the contact support and are acting more effectively, since the distance between the contact support and the arc quenching chamber is constant throughout the entire movement process. The use of identical arc splitters additionally reduces the range of components. </paragraph>
