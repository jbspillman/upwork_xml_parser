<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention concerns a system (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) for receiving, storing and processing electronic vouchers for a consumer equipped with a mobile telephone or a personal digital assistant (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The mobile tool comprises means (<highlight><bold>12, 5, 7</bold></highlight>) for exchanging data with a payment terminal (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) during a purchasing operation, based on an offer of electronic vouchers corresponding to discounts. At least an electronic voucher is received and stored in a storage unit (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) of the mobile tool, the codes (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) of the purchased articles (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) are read at the payment terminal and the list of vouchers stored in the mobile tool is transmitted to the payment terminal. The list of vouchers is compared with the list of purchased articles and if one or several articles are identified for which vouchers exist, the amount of discount(s) corresponding to said vouchers is automatically deducted from the total amount of purchased articles. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method of receiving, storing and processing electronic coupons with a mobile phone or PDA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It also relates to a system of receiving, storing and processing electronic coupons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It has an especially important, although not exclusive, application in the area of loyalty programs intended to encourage consumers to return to the same store or store group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Systems of obtaining a discount through a paper coupon to be handed over at the cash-desk during the act of purchase are already known. This paper coupon may include a bar code for facilitating its processing. Paper coupons are generally cut out of newspapers or printed out at a kiosk and more recently on a PC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are also solutions with chip cards where discount coupons are stored in electronic form in the card&apos;s chip. The card is inserted into a reader at the point of sale and the items scanned are compared with the coupons stored in the card&apos;s memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When a purchased item benefits from a coupon, the system deducts the amount of the discount, prints it on the customer slip then sends the information back to the central server for compensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the existing systems have drawbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Paper discount coupons require cumbersome and costly management for distributing the offer, using the discount at the point of sale and finally processing the information. The accumulation of paper discount vouchers by the consumer also acts as a curb on their use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Solutions using a chip card for storing discount coupons require a card to be handed over to the consumer and the presence of a reader for read and/or write processing. The main drawback here is the need to set up an end-to-end hardware infrastructure. Furthermore, when using a card the consumer cannot easily view the coupons stored on the card and the associated validity conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Faced with this gap, the card bearer must therefore, as a necessity, insert his/her card into a device equipped with a reader (kiosk, digital decoder, PC, payment terminal), to receive their discount offers, use them at the point of sale or consult the benefits stored on the card. The list of coupons may then, and for example, be printed at the point of sale by the payment terminal processing the chip card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is aimed at remedying these drawbacks and providing a method and a device better at meeting practical requirements than those previously known, especially in enabling consumers to easily benefit from discount coupons to be redeemed at stores or supermarkets, thanks to their mobile phone or equivalent, for example a PDA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention can be used to set up an extremely powerful, easy-to-use method or system which will in particular and for example allow the very accurate measurement of the impact of an advertisement on a consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus, a portable device (mobile phone or PDA), an instrument used by the general public, enables the consumer to participate in the stores&apos; loyalty program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> On its part, the store will use the consumer&apos;s own portable device to store information and behavioral data about them, which will condition the issue of benefits, without having to create a special storage medium like a loyalty card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This is because the mobile phone or PDA are portable, secure, mass-distributed objects offering many more facilities than a simple card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, the mobile phone and the PDA are connected instruments, equipped with a keyboard and a screen, which will enable the consumer to access information about his/her purchasing history and entitlements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Consulting purchasing history and entitlements can now be done in real time, at any moment, without any complicated administrative procedure, without even resorting to any additional device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Finally, the store inherits all the previous advantages, enabling it to maximize its chances of securing customer loyalty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The connected mobile phone can also easily receive promotional offers at any time, anywhere, by simple data reception (example: short message reception). Reception may take place as a result of an &ldquo;active&rdquo; procedure on the part of consumers, who select the desired offers on the media of their choice, (so-called &ldquo;pull&rdquo; offers or method), or as a result of a &ldquo;passive&rdquo; procedure by first communicating their profile and preferences (so-called &ldquo;push&rdquo; geomarketing offers or method). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The invention is thus chiefly based first on the idea of becoming free of the card, which assumes a &ldquo;physical contact&rdquo; with a reader for receiving the offer and its use at the point of sale, and secondly on the very strong and surprising synergetic effectiveness of the aforementioned &ldquo;push-pull&rdquo; procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the invention proposes in particular a method of receiving, storing and processing electronic coupons for a consumer equipped with a mobile device (mobile phone or PDA), said mobile device including means of exchanging data with a payment terminal during a purchase operation, characterized in that, based on electronic coupon offers corresponding to discounts, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> at least one electronic coupon is received and stored in a mobile device memory, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> the codes of the purchased items are read at the payment terminal, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> the list of coupons stored in the mobile device is transmitted to the payment terminal, or conversely the list of items purchased, read off at the payment terminal, is transmitted to the mobile device, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> said list of coupons is compared with said list of items purchased, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> and if one or more items are identified for which there are one or more coupons, the amount of the discount or discounts corresponding to said coupons is automatically deducted from the total amount of the purchases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The discount may correspond to the total price of one or more items which will then be regarded as free offers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In advantageous embodiments one and/or other of the following arrangements are additionally or equally resorted to: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> the data is transmitted between the mobile device and the terminal via radio or infrared waves; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> the electronic coupon or coupons is/are transmitted to the mobile device via a centralized information server network like the Internet; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> for selecting the electronic coupons offer the consumer operates a television remote control, for example during the broadcast of a commercial, the electronic coupon or coupons then being automatically downloaded into the mobile device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> for selecting the electronic coupons offer received directly by the consumer via his/her mobile device, via the Internet, and/or via a kiosk, the consumer operates the keyboard of his/her mobile device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> at the same time as the offer, additional conditions of use on the premises and/or the date of validity, and/or information concerning the product are transmitted, said information being set out to be viewed by the consumer consulting his/her mobile device via the keyboard; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> offers are transmitted to the consumer who receives them passively on his/her mobile device according to or not according to a specified profile of said consumer identified by his/her mobile device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> for selecting the electronic coupons offer, the mobile device is located in space and the electronic coupon or coupons is/are transmitted to said mobile device according to the geographical position of said mobile device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> the mobile coupon or coupons is/are downloaded directly close to the payment terminal; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> once the deduction has been made, the information is automatically transmitted to a remote server where said information is processed by adding to a behavioral database regarding the mobile device associated with said consumer and/or by incrementing a counter for the store at which said discount has been implemented, to enable said store to be reimbursed for the discount granted to the consumer, substantially in real time; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> the consumer consults the set of coupons that he/she has available by manually checking his/her mobile device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The invention also proposes a system of receiving, storing and processing electronic coupons implementing the method described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It also proposes a system of receiving, storing and processing electronic coupons during item purchasing operations at a point of sale by a consumer, the system comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A mobile phone or a PDA equipped with a data memory (SIM card and/or built-in memory, etc.). To simplify matters, only the term mobile phone will be mentioned from now on. But obviously it can be replaced by the term PDA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A point-of-sale terminal, for example of the electronic cash register type, capable of communicating directly or via a peripheral (payment unit or terminal) with the mobile phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A device for reading item codes of purchased items (e.g. bar code scanner or contactless microchip reader) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> One or more PC type remote information servers, providing the following functions: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> sending discount coupons to the mobile phone (e.g. SMS server), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> gathering and processing data relating to point-of-sale transactions, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> if necessary, sending data to the mobile phone required for consulting discount coupons and other associated validity conditions on the screen of said phone, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A communications protocol between the mobile phone and the terminal (here the electronic cash register), communication being capable of being direct or via a peripheral (payment unit or terminal) equipped with a communications module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the communications module may be, by way of example, a module using one and/or the other of the following standards: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> software modules including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> a main module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> responsible first for translating the external information received from the point-of-sale terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or from the information server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, updating the data stored in the memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and sending the information required by the point-of-sale terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, via the intermediary of the protocol interface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and secondly for translating the data stored in the memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, possibly comparing them with those contained in the server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, via the intermediary of the protocol interface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and distributing this information to the display and navigation module <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> said display and navigation module <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, responsible for displaying this information on the display screen <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and for consultation of the various coupons thanks to the navigation tool <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The point-of-sale terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> itself includes, either built-in, or as a peripheral: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, known in itself, of reading codes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the items <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which can be used for example to scan the bar code <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> printed on said purchased items </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> a cash register <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> consisting of three main modules, namely: a communications module <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for exchanging data with the portable phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a cash register software program <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which will process all the information linked to the items scanned and to the associated discount coupons and, a database <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> containing the information associated with each of the item codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In some cases, where it is not possible to communicate directly with the portable phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the cash register <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be connected to a peripheral, payment unit or terminal (not shown), capable of communicating with the portable phone and transmitting the information to or from the point-of-sale terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> We are now going to describe as an example of operation, the issue of a discount coupon for redeeming in a supermarket chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> To do so, the electronic coupons are first of all received and stored according to one and/or the other of the following methods of reception: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A. Selection of Discount Coupons or Promotional Offers: So-Called &ldquo;PULL&rdquo; Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The offer is selected here on a chosen interactive medium, that is, for example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> selection on the phone screen on a WAP (wireless protocol application) compatible site connected to the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> selection on a PC connected to the Internet, by specifying from the coupons offered on the site, the offer or offers that are wanted, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> selection of the discount coupon on an interactive kiosk, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> selection of the coupon on an interactive television, either from a list of proposed offers, or by operating a remote control when a commercial is being broadcast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> At that time, the consumer (TV viewer) automatically receives in his/her mobile phone, in standby state, the promotional offer (or electronic discount coupon) associated with the product or with the product range shown in this commercial. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The selection of a discount coupon during a commercial may also and for example be accompanied by additional information on the product in question thanks to the sending of a link to an Internet site. This link is received on the consumer&apos;s electronic mail system (e-mail system of a WAP phone, PC or television with access to the Internet or WebTV). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> For example (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), the consumer chooses the following discount coupons: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;5 francs discount on the sale of a detergent&rdquo; by navigating around on his/her WAP phone; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;1 packet of coffee FREE for 2 packets purchased&rdquo; on an Internet site specializing in couponing; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;The 5<highlight><italic>th </italic></highlight>soda bought before Nov. 17, 2000 is FREE&rdquo;, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> by activating a function of his/her remote control when a commercial is broadcast on the television extolling the merits of a famous brand of soda. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Each offer is then and for example subject to additional conditions of use such as the date of validity, the premises for use etc. Selecting a discount coupon can thus entail the simultaneous sending of information about the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> B. Receiving Targeted Offers: So-Called &ldquo;PUSH&rdquo; Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In this case, the consumer receives his/her offers passively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In an advantageous embodiment the consumer can also indicate his/her preferences and/or his/her profile, thus the offers broadcast by the advertisers are then better targeted and therefore of greater perceived value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> There are also other methods for targeting promotional offers, like &ldquo;geomarketing&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> This concept is a good example of what the method and system according to the invention can be used for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> It is based on location techniques, which offer the possibility of locating a mobile phone in space, and sending it suitable offers according to its geographical position and profile, subject to respecting the applicable privacy protection laws in the case in point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Here, for example, the consumer&apos;s agreement must be sought to prevent the sending of unwanted promotional offers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> C. Discount Coupons can also be Issued at the Point of Sale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> To do this, the products concerned are scanned for example and a downloaded coupon is obtained in the mobile phone directly at the point of sale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Here it is also possible to receive discount coupons at the point-of-sale terminal itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> These promotional offers are then and for example issued randomly or in accordance with predetermined conditions linked to the consumer&apos;s profile, where the consumer is recognized by the point-of-sale terminal from the information stored in his/her portable phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment more specifically described here, sending offers to the consumer&apos;s portable phone and storing the information takes place in the following way: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The consumer is identified by his/her phone number, this number being capable of being supplemented with certain information such as their name, e-mail address, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The offer or offers selected by the identified consumer are then sent to an information server, which will be responsible for transmitting the discount offer to the consumer&apos;s phone. This transmission can be carried out via so-called SMS simple short messages. The consumer receives the discount offer on the screen of his/her portable phone, a key on the keyboard is used to validate the acceptance of this offer and store it in the phone&apos;s memory (built-in memory, SIM card or other). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Once the electronic coupon or coupons have been received, they will be able to be used for example as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> When the consumer has made his/her choice of items, he/she goes to the point of sale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The item codes are then read on the cash register (bar code scanner, contactless microchip reading, etc.) then the consumer&apos;s portable phone enters into communication with the point-of-sale terminal (or an intermediate peripheral). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> This communication may be initiated by the customer who, using an appropriate key, sends the coupons that he/she holds for processing by the cash register, or by the cash register itself, which will send a request to the portable phone to receive the valid offers at this point of sale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The data exchange between the phone and the cash register uses, as we have seen, Bluetooth, IrDa or SMS technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Then the cash register compares the list of coupons transmitted by the portable phone with the list of items read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> If it identifies an item to which a promotional coupon applies, the amount of the discount is automatically deducted from the total amount of the purchases, the information is retranscribed onto the till slip and the discount coupon sent to the information server for processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> For some discount coupons of the &ldquo;5<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>soda purchased is free&rdquo; type, an item counter is included in the information relating to the coupon, this counter is updated in the phone memory thanks to the cash register, which sends back the information, so long as the coupon remains valid (here, purchase of 5 sodas in the month). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The system then processes and uses the information according to the embodiment of the invention specifically described here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The use of a coupon here, in fact, gives rise to a feedback of information to the central server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> This information may be used to compensate the face value of the coupon, i.e. to reimburse the store for the amount of the discount granted to the customer. In addition, using these data offers a level of knowledge regarding the purchasing behavior of an identified consumer. These analyses may also be used to refine the targeting of offers and to better segment the transmission of new offers. The process is naturally enhanced through the effect of experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment, the consumer will be able to view and consult his/her set of available electronic coupons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> This means that the portable phone screen can be used to consult coupons stored in the phone memory, the conditions of obtaining coupons being for example explicitly viewed on the screen of the portable phone as shown with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The operation of the system and the method according to the specifically envisaged embodiment of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The discount coupons are received on the phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from one or more information servers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> thanks to the communications module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and via the interface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The main module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> retrieves the data associated with the coupon(s) for storing them in the memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> At the point of sale, the purchased items are read or scanned at the cash register <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by a bar code reader or any other reading device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, then the consumer&apos;s portable phone enters into communication with the point-of-sale terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (directly or via an intermediate peripheral). This communication may be initiated by the customer who, using an appropriate key, sends the coupons that he/she holds for processing by the cash register, or by the cash register itself, which then sends a request to the portable phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to receive the valid discount offers at this point of sale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The main module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> processes the request and sends back the list of coupons contained in the memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> thanks to the communications module <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> via the protocol interface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> As already seen, the data exchange between the phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the cash register <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> uses Bluetooth, IrDa or SMS type technologies. Communication between the point-of-sale terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the portable phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> takes place thanks to the communications modules <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via the protocol interface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The initialization of communications between the portable phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the payment terminal or point-of-sale terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is carried out by simple pointing (point-to-point communications) in the case of an infrared link, in the case of &ldquo;Bluetooth&rdquo; technology the identification and synchronization between the two instruments is performed by frequency negotiation within a master/slave type relationship. Finally, short message communications require dialing a phone number to set up the link and information exchange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the cash register <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, thanks to its internal software <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, compares the list of coupons transmitted by the portable phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the list of items read or scanned by the reader <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Other systems of reading may be envisaged, like, for example, resorting to so-called contactless reading of item codes thanks to the use of a microchip affixed to the product itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> When an item is identified, to which a promotional coupon applies, the amount of the discount is automatically deducted from the total amount of the purchases, the information being retranscribed onto the till slip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The information collected at the time of the transaction is then transmitted to the information server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The main module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> itself retrieves the information returned by the point-of-sale terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and updates the data in the memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> For some discount coupons of the &ldquo;5<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>soda purchased is free&rdquo; type, an item counter is included in the information relating to the coupon, this counter being updated in the phone memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> thanks to the cash register <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which sends back the information, so long as the coupon validity criterion is met (here, purchase of 5 sodas in the month). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> As stated previously, the consumer can also receive discount coupons at the point-of-sale terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, either randomly or according to well-defined criteria (consumer profile, loyalty program, etc.). These coupons are themselves also stored in this same coupons file contained in the memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the portable phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> thanks to the main module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which processes the information originating from the communications module <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> via the interface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> To enable consultation by a consumer, the main module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> accesses the information contained in the memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When the information contained in the memory is exhaustive, it distributes this data to the display and navigation module <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> When the information contained in the memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is partial, and the main module is advantageously set up to obtain the missing information by means of a remote interrogation of the information server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via the intermediary of the communications module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the protocol interface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The main module then compares the information from the memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with that originating from the server, then distributes it to the display and navigation module <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> After receiving these data, the display and navigation module <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formats them and transmits them to the display <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for viewing. These data may then be consulted by the bearer using the navigation tool <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> We are now going to describe the information contained in the memory of the phone or mobile device belonging to the system specifically envisaged here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> This information contained in the memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the phone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is distributed in the following files: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The General File </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> This contains the phone and/or operator description information, and in particular: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> An identification number for the phone and/or the SIM card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The name of the operator (or an identifier enabling it to be retrieved). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The validity date of the subscription. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The Consumer File </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> This contains the description information of the phone&apos;s owner, such as: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The owner&apos;s name. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> An identification number for the holder (such as a subscription number). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Demographic information, such as date of birth, his/her address, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Biometric information, such as the holder&apos;s size, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The Coupons File </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> This is used to store the discount coupon(s) in the phone memory for later use. From the information contained in this file, among other things and for example the following are retrieved: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> An offer identifier </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> A coupon identification code </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The coupon validity date </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The descriptive text or label of the coupon </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> An identifier of the acceptance network </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In the case of cumulative purchases over time (e.g. 5<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>cola purchased before December 31 free): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The number of items required for validating the discount coupon </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> An item counter </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The So-Called RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) File </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> This stores purchasing behavior history, such as the running total of amounts spent for each of the stores frequented by the possessor of the portable phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> This file is structured into records, each record containing information specific to the loyalty program(s) of a store (or of several of them when the loyalty program is common to several stores). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Each record contains: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> A loyalty program identification number, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The type of loyalty program practiced by this store, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The expiration date of the loyalty program, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The date of the last visit made to this store, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The number of visits made to this store, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The running total of the purchases made at this store, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In certain cases the cumulative number of items purchased at this store (e.g. &num; pizzas). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The Points File </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> This stores the running total of loyalty points acquired by the possessor of the portable phone at one or more stores (in the case where the benefit takes the form of issuing loyalty points of the cumulative promotional unit type, exchangeable against a reward). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> As is obvious and as emerges moreover from the foregoing, the present invention is not restricted to the envisaged embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, it embraces all variants and especially those where the mobile device is a watch, where the keyboard of the mobile device is a touch screen and where the communications protocols between servers, phone and point of sale are different from those specifically described. </paragraph>
