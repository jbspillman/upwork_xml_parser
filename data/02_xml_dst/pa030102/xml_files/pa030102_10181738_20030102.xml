<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to automated cooking apparatus. In particular, the present invention relates to an improved heating arrangement for oven-type cooking apparatus and method for using the same. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In Singapore Patent Application No. 200000777-3 filed on Feb. 9, 2000, the applicant of the present invention described a novel, automated, oventype cooking apparatus that could achieve the dual function of baking bread or dough based products and cooking skewered meats similar to that of a traditional tandoori oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The automated oven-type cooking apparatus as taught in Singapore Patent Application No. 200000777-3 achieves substantially the major objectives of the invention: (1) capable of dual function of cooking bread and meat, (2) produces high quality and consistency without the monitoring of an experienced chef; and (3) features a compact and hygienic design that results in easy maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is the ultimate objective of the applicant of the present invention to make available to almost all types of restaurants such automated oven-type cooking apparatus, in particular, fast food restaurants and catering specialists. Towards that end, the automated oven-type cooking apparatus taught in Singapore Patent Application No. 200000777-3 should have a throughput that is higher, weight less so that it is not only compact but portable; more energy efficient so that auxiliary source of fuel is obviated; and attain better safety in handling by non-professional kitchen staff. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide for an improved heating arrangement in automated oven-type cooking apparatus so that more bread and meats can be processed with consistent quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to reduce the overall material weight of the automated oven-type cooking apparatus while optimizing the baking and skewering capacity of the equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to improve the overall safety in loading and unloading of breads and meats in and out of automated oven-type cooking apparatus. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The orientation of the heating unit of an automated oven-type cooking apparatus is changed from outwardly radiating direction to and inwardly radiating one. As a result, the center core of any automated oven-type cooking apparatus can make way for more meat skewers. Not only is the overall safety of handling breads and/or meat skewers improved, the heat differential between the top and bottom surface of the bread products is narrowed significantly. It follows that the browning of bread products such as naan is completed with the improved orientation of the heating unit while the cooking of skewered meats is unaffected. As a result, a truly portable oven-type cooking apparatus is realized.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention discloses an improved heating unit for an automated oven-type cooking apparatus. The contents of Singapore Patent Application No. 200000777-3 filed on Feb. 9, 2000 by the same applicant as the present invention are incorporated by reference to the extent the description relates to non-heating unit portion of the application. Specifically, the present invention relates to the arrangement of the heater of the heating unit </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective, cutaway, elevational view of the automated oven-type cooking apparatus featuring an improved heating unit that radiates inwardly towards the core of the apparatus. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is substantially similar to the naan cooking module and meat cooking module as illustrated and described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> of Singapore Patent Application No. 200000777-3 by the same applicant except for the heating. Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an improved automated oven-type cooking apparatus <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the present invention comprises of at least one naan cooking module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and at least one meat cooking module <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> disposed on top of at least one base <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Instead of being centrally located, a heating unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the present invention is located on top of the periphery of a base <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the automated oven-type cooking apparatus. The gas burner (not shown in the figures) and the heaters assembly <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>A are the same as those in Singapore Patent Application No. 200000777-3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of the present invention obviates the central burner housing structure of Singapore Patent Application No. 200000777-3. As a direct result, the weight of the improved automated oven-type cooking apparatus is reduced. Above all, it frees up a lot of space <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for the meat cooking module <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. It follows that more meat skewers can be inserted into the meat cooking module per production run. More importantly, the orientation of the heaters <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>A is directed substantially radially inwards towards the centre of the cooking apparatus <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. It means that non-professional kitchen staff can handle the cooking process with greater safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Again in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the convection of heat from an inwardly radiating set of heaters <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> generates better thermo environment for the cooking of bread-based products. Not only are most of the energy from the inwardly radiating heaters utilized by the meat cooking module, the convection of heat to the naan cooking module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is improved because the energy from the heaters not only dissipates from the gap between the support plate <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the heaters <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> but also the remaining inwardly directly heat through the convection holes <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the naan disposed on the support plate are browned more completely than that of the apparatus in Singapore Patent Application No. 200000777-3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Once the bread products are baked and browned, a wire <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> disposed substantially in parallel and offset with the inclined surface of the support plate <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> removes the cooked bread products or naan from the bread cooking module automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The presently disclosed embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are, therefore, to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
