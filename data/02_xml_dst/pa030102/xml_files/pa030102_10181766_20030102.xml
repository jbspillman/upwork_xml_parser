<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a combiner and a method of forming a combiner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A combiner is conventionally formed from a first glass prism having a surface arranged to carry a dielectric coating applied to the surface, such that the dielectric coating is arranged to reflect light from an image, and a second glass prism having a surface bonded to the surface of the first glass prism using optical cement. In this manner, when a user, typically a pilot of an aircraft, views a scene through the combiner, the image appears to be superimposed on the scene. It will be understood that an image generator, such as a cathode ray tube, flat panel display or another suitable image generating means, can generate an image containing information such as primary flight data relating to the aircraft, for example, navigation and guidance information or cues for the user to follow. Therefore, the image can be conveyed to the user so as to overlay a scene viewed by the user through the combiner such that the user does not need to look away from the scene, for example to read primary flight data from a head down display, and the image is provided at infinity such that the eye of the user does not need to be refocused in order to view the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, if the combiner is to be used as part of or an attachment to headgear, such as a helmet or goggles, worn by the user then the weight of the combiner will increase the mass required to be supported by the head and particularly the neck of the user, thereby increasing user fatigue when using the headgear. Furthermore, the safety of the user can also be compromised, particularly during ejection from the aircraft. Accordingly, the headgear or a part thereof needs to be removed prior to ejection of the user from the aircraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The weight of the combiner can be reduced by replacing the first and second glass prisms with a pair of plastic prisms formed from one of a range of optical plastics. Such plastics have been used to form lenses in optical systems for many years where light weight, safety or cost effectiveness of a mass produced lens is desirable. However, these plastics are relatively unstable materials to polish or to manufacture to a high precision, for example by moulding, due to their physical properties. When such plastics are polished or moulded they deform under manufacturing stress which causes the finished surface of the prism to differ to that original intended. Furthermore, the surface of the plastic is soft making a smooth polished finish difficult to achieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, perhaps more importantly, without special techniques, which are still under development, an optical coating applied to a plastic surface is of a much poorer quality than an optical coating applied to a glass surface. That is the optical coating tends to craze thereby hazing the user&apos;s vision of a scene viewed through the combiner or the optical coating may peel from the plastic surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the disadvantages associated with the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the invention, a combiner comprises a glass reflector having a surface, a plastic prism having a surface arranged to adhere to the surface of the glass reflector, and a bonding agent arranged to adhere the surface of the glass reflector to the surface of the prism, wherein the bonding agent is arranged to allow the glass reflector and the plastic prism to expand and contract at different rates with respect to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the different rates of expansion and contraction, that is the difference in the expansion coefficient between the glass reflector and the plastic prism can be absorbed by the bonding agent used to adhere the glass reflector to the plastic prism during thermal cycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The surface of the glass reflector may be curved and the surface of the plastic prism may be arranged to complement the surface of the glass reflector. The surface of the glass reflector may also comprise a dielectric coating. In this manner, an optical coating can be disposed at the surface of the glass reflector thereby inhibiting crazing associated with disposing an optical coating on a surface of a plastic prism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the glass reflector may have a second surface arranged to adhere to a surface of a second plastic prism, and a bonding agent may be arranged to adhere the second surface of the glass reflector to the surface of the second plastic prism. The second surface of the glass reflector may also comprise a dielectric coating. The second surface of the glass reflector may be curved and the surface of the second plastic prism may be arranged to complement the second surface of the glass reflector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the plastic prism may have a second surface arranged to adhere to a surface of a second glass reflector, and a bonding agent may be arranged to adhere the second surface of the plastic prism to the surface of the second glass reflector. The surface of the second glass reflector may also comprise a dielectric coating. The surface of the second glass reflector may be curved and the second surface of the plastic prism may be arranged to complement the surface of the second glass reflector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The or each glass reflector may be a pellicle reflector. The bonding agent may be a flexible silicone adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the combiner may be an eyepiece combiner arranged to form part of a helmet mounted display system. A combiner according to the invention is lighter than a conventional combiner formed from glass incorporate within headgear to be worn by a user, therefore the combiner reduces the loading of the headgear on the neck of the user and the user may eject from the aircraft while wearing the headgear incorporating the combiner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the invention, as method of forming a combiner includes forming a surface on a glass reflector, forming a surface on a plastic prism and arranging the surface to adhere to the surface of the glass reflector, and bonding the surface of the glass reflector to the surface of the prism, such that the bonding agent is arranged to allow the glass reflector and the plastic prism to expand and contract at different rates with respect to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The method may include priming the surface of the glass reflector and the surface of the plastic prism prior to bonding the surfaces to one another. The method may include coating the surface of the glass reflector with a dielectric coating prior to priming the surface of the glass reflector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the method may include forming a second surface on the glass reflector, forming a surface on a second plastic prism and bonding the second surface of the glass reflector to the surface of the second plastic prism. The method may include priming the second surface of the glass reflector and the surface of the second plastic prism prior to bonding the surfaces to one another. The method may include coating the second surface of the glass reflector with a dielectric coating prior to priming the second surface of the glass reflector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the method may include forming a second surface on the plastic prism, forming a surface on a second glass reflector and bonding the second surface of the plastic prism to the surface of the second glass reflector. The method may include priming the second surface of the plastic prism and the surface of the second glass reflector prior to bonding the surfaces to one another. The method may include coating the surface of the second glass reflector with a dielectric coating prior to priming the surface of the second glass reflector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The method may include forming the or each surfaces such that it is curved.</paragraph>

<brief-description-of-drawings>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates in cross section a combiner according to a first embodiment of the invention; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates in cross section a combiner according to a second embodiment of the invention, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a combiner as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> used as part of a head up display system.</paragraph>
</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The inventor has realised that the difference in quality of an optical coating on a plastic surface as opposed to a glass surface is due to the dielectric material used to form the optical coating. Dielectric materials, which are applied to the plastic surface in a number of thin layers to constitute the optical coating, have similar physical properties to those of glass and thus there exists a large difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the dielectric materials used to form the optical coating and the thermal expansion coefficient of the plastic surface. This leads to a crazing effect of the optical coating after thermally cycling which effects a user&apos;s vision of a scene viewed through the plastic surface and the optical coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the inventor has also realised that a plastic surface has a lower melting point compared with a glass surface and thus the deposition of an optical coating on to a plastic surface must be done at a substantially lower temperature compared with deposition of the optical coating on a glass surface. This results in a poorer adhesion of the optical coating to the plastic surface than can be achieved between an optical coating and a glass surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first embodiment of the invention comprises a combiner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, such as a glass pellicle reflector, that has first and second curved surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that have an optical coating, not illustrated, on either or both of the surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A first plastic prism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> arranged to complement the curved surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the glass reflector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A second plastic prism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> arranged to complement the second curved surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The first and second curved surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the surfaces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the first and second plastic prisms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are each primed with a suitable primer which is allowed to dry and is then polished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, first plastic prism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second plastic prism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are arranged with respect to one another such that the first curved surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> forms a well <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with the surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the first plastic prism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the second curved surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> forms a well <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with the surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the second plastic prism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, first plastic prism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second plastic prism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be retained in position relative to one another using a jig, not illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The wells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are completed with a seal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> arranged to close the wells <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a lower end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. That is, the gap between the first curved surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the glass reflector and surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the first plastic prism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the second curved surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the second plastic prism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are sealed at the lower end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The seal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be formed from a flexible silicone material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A bonding agent <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, represented by double hatchings in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is then injected into the wells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so as to fill the wells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The combiner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is then placed in a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air bubbles within the wells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The bonding agent <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is then allowed to cure at a temperature which will not unduly stress the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, first plastic prism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second plastic prism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It will be understood, that a dielectric coating, not illustrated, can be applied to either the first curved surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or second curved surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, or indeed both surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, prior to the surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> being primed and the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> being adhered to the first and second plastic prisms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that the optical coating has both light transmissive and light reflective properties. In this manner, a combiner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, suitable for use as an eyepiece in a head up display, can be formed from materials lighter than a conventional combiner using a pair of glass prisms bonded to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The bonding agent <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed from a flexible silicone material arranged to compensate for the different rates of expansion and contractions, that is the difference in the expansion coefficient between the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the first and second plastic prisms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the combiner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is caused to expand or contract during thermal cycling the adhesive will absorb shear stress caused by the different expansion coefficients, thereby providing a means to suitably adhere the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the first and second and plastic prisms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the crazing associated with prior art optical coating on a plastic surface is obviated as the optical coating is applied to a glass surface of the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the glass reflector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will have a greater range of reflective indices and dispersive properties compared with a plastic surface having the same optical coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the first curved surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be simply curved or may be concaved, that is substantially spherical. Similarly, the second curved surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be simply curved to complement the first curved surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or may be convex, that is substantially spherical, to complement the first curved surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The second plastic prism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> tends to distort light passing through its body, thereby causing distortion of the scene as viewed by a user. Therefore, the first plastic prism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is arranged to correct distortions generated by the second plastic prison <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> second embodiment of the invention, comprises a combiner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a plastic prism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which has a first curved surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a second curved surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. A first glass reflector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> arranged to complement the first curved surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the plastic prism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a second glass reflector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having a surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> arranged to complement the second curved surface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the plastic prism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The first and second curved surfaces <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the plastics prism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the surfaces <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> respectively of the first and second reflectors <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are each primed with a suitable primer which is allowed to dry and is then polished. The first and second glass reflectors <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be glass pellicle reflectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The first glass reflector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is arranged with respect to the plastic prism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> such that the first curved surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the first glass reflector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> form a well <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a seal <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> closes an end of the well <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The seal <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> can be formed from a flexible silicone material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the second glass reflector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and plastic prism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be arranged with respect to one another such that the first curved surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of second glass reflector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> form a well <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> closed at one end with a seal <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Again, the seal <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can be formed from a flexible silicone material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It will be understood, that the plastic prism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the first and second glass reflectors <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be held with respect to one another using a jig, not illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Bonding agent <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, represented by double cross hatching in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is then injected into the wells <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As in the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the combiner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is placed in a vacuum chamber so as to remove any air bubbles in the bonding agent <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the bonding agent <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is allowed to cure at a temperature which does not unduly stress the plastic prism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the first and second glass reflectors <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the plastic prism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has extensions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to provide a suitable mounting position for the combiner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> within an optical system, not illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the first and second curved surfaces <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the prism <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be curved or convex, that is substantially spherical, and that the surfaces <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> respectively of the first and second glass reflectors <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be concaved to complement their respective curved surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The second glass reflector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> tends to distort light passing through its body, thereby causing distortion of the scene as viewed by a user. Therefore, the first glass reflector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is arranged to correct distortions generated by the second glass reflector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in which like references have been used to indicate similar integers to those used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> combiner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned within a line of sight <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of an eye <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of a user, not illustrated. The eye <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> views a scene <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, in this instance indicated by an arrow, through the combiner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An image, not illustrated, formed by an image generator and optical system associated with the combiner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, also not illustrated, follows a light path <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the image is internally reflected from an aft surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, of the first plastic prism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, into the first curved surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the glass reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The optical coating disposed on the first curved surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> then reflects the image to follow a light ray path <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> along the line of sight <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the eye <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the user of the combiner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, typically a pilot of an aircraft, views the scene <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through the combiner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, that is through the optical coating, and the image appears to be superimposed on the scene <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Therefore, an image, which can represent primary flight data relating to the aircraft, can be conveyed to an eye <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the user so as to overlay a scene <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> viewed by the eye <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> through the combiner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such that the user does not need to look away from the scene <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, for example to read primary flight data from a head down display, and the image is provided at infinity such that the eye <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the user does not need to be refocused in order to view the image. It will be understood that the combiner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> operates in a similar manner to that described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It will also be understood that although the invention is described and predominately intended for use as a combiner, especially as an eyepiece combiner, to convey information to a pilot, the invention can find applications in other environments where information needs to be conveyed to a user such that the user does not need to look away from a scene viewed through the combiner. For example, a combiner according to the invention could be used in other transportation vehicles and to convey information from a central location to a user. </paragraph>
