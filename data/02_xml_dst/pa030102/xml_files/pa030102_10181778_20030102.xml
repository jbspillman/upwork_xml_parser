<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a composition for forming a tantalum oxide film, a process for forming a tantalum oxide film, a tantalum oxide film and use thereof. More specifically, it relates to a composition for forming a tantalum oxide film suitable for use as an insulating film for semiconductor devices, such as a capacitor insulating film or a gate insulating film for use in DRAMs, a tantalum oxide film, a process for forming the same and use of a tantalum oxide film as an insulating film. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The area of a capacitor in a DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) has been becoming smaller due to increases in the integration and density of a semiconductor device. When the capacity becomes smaller as the area of a capacitor decreases, the erroneous operation of a device may occur due to a software error or the like. Therefore, even when the area of the capacitor decreases, a sufficient capacity must be ensured. One of the means of solving this problem is to use an insulating film having a high dielectric constant (high dielectric film) as a capacitor insulating film. A SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>film has been used as a capacitor insulating film and capacity has been ensured by a 3-D memory cell structure. However, due to a recent tendency to rapidly increase the integration and reduce the design rule of a DRAM, it is becoming difficult to ensure the capacity of a memory cell with prior art methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Tantalum oxide is characterized in that it has a dielectric constant 3 times or more higher than SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>which have been used in capacitor insulating films and a thin film thereof having excellent step coverage can be easily deposited by CVD. Therefore, researches into tantalum oxide as the next-generation DRAM capacitor insulating film are now under way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The method of forming a tantalum oxide insulating film by CVD is disclosed in Applied Physics 69(9), p. 1067 (2000). Various studies on tantalum materials used for CVD are reported in Electronic Materials, No. 7, p. 18 (2000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, tantalum oxide insulating films formed by these prior art methods contain large quantities of impurities and oxygen defect due to their raw materials and film forming methods, which causes a leak current and reduces dielectric breakdown. A tantalum alkoxide used as a raw material to form a film by CVD has problems that its hydrolyzability is high and that impurities such as carbon remain in the film in large quantities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Further, film formation by CVD requires a bulky apparatus which is expensive itself and consumes a large amount of energy for vacuum and plasma systems, thereby boosting product costs. </paragraph>
