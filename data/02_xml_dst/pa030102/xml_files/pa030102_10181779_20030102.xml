<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to packings for chromatography, more particularly it relates to packings for chromatography which allow direct analysis of trace amounts of components present in serum and the like. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently high-performance liquid chromatography has been widely employed for separation or for qualitative or quantitative analyses of various materials. Since its separating power depends largely on the column employed, various columns have been developed and commercially available. Particularly prevalent columns among them are those comprising a carrier such as silica gel having carbon chains bonded thereto, and are generally referred to as reversed-phase columns. By the way, the high performance liquid chromatography, having high separating power and high sensitivity, has been often used for quantitative analysis of biological components such as low molecular weight compounds contained in plasma and the like. However, biological components in plasma such as albumin are likely to be adsorbed to the column, particularly when a reversed-phase type column is employed, resulting in a lowering the separating power of the column and increasing the pressure required for sending the solvent. Therefore, pretreatments have been required so far for removing the plasma protein and the like. In order to overcome these defects, Pinkerton et al. have developed a column comprising a porous silica gel support in which only the inside is chemically modified (Anal. Chem. 1985, Vol. 57, pp. 1757-1763). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The column developed by Pinkerton et al. is superior in eliminating the interference of the biological component during the analysis, but it is not sufficiently satisfactory from the viewpoints of retention of the low molecular weight compounds by the column, separating power and durability of the column. There are other columns such as those disclosed in JP-A 5-87790, which have been developed for similar purposes as the column developed by Pinkerton et al., but they are not satisfactory either. In addition to that, these columns including the ones developed by Pinkerton et al. are expensive since they have been produced in complicated production processes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Disclosure of the Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have extensively studied on a packing and a column packed with such a packing which can avoid the interference of biological components and show sufficient retentive and separating capacities, and have found that the defects of the conventional columns can be solved with the construction shown below, and completed the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a packing for chromatography comprising a porous carrier with the surface bonded to a hydrophilic polymeric material, and a carbon chain chemically bonded to inside of the pore. The present invention also relates to a column packed with a packing for chromatography comprising a porous carrier with the surface bonded to a hydrophilic polymeric material, and a carbon chain chemically bonded to inside of the pore. The present invention further relates to a method of analyzing or separating trace amounts of components by injecting whole blood, plasma or serum into a column packed with a packing for chromatography comprising a porous carrier with the surface bonded to a hydrophilic polymeric material, and a carbon chain chemically bonded to inside of the pore. The present invention further relates to a use of a packing comprising a porous carrier with the surface bonded to a hydrophilic polymeric material, and a carbon chain chemically bonded to inside of the pore, as a packing for chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When a packing for chromatography according to the present invention is employed for analysis of low molecular weight compounds in a biological sample, pretreatment such as protein removal and the like becomes unnecessary, the analysis of the biological components can be directly carried out, the analytical method is simplified and the time required for analysis is shortened. To provide such a packing is an object of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A porous carrier according to the present invention includes silica gel, cellulose, agarose and a synthetic polymer, having a particle diameter of generally 2 to 100 &mgr;m. As the carrier has many pores dented from the surface, it has a large specific surface area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A hydrophilic polymeric material means a polymeric substance having a hydrophilic group such as hydroxyl group having a molecular weight of from 1,000 to 2,000,000, and examples thereof include methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrolidone and hexadimethrine bromide. &ldquo;A carrier with the surface bonded to a hydrophilic polymeric material&rdquo; according to the present invention refers to a carrier wherein a hydrophilic polymeric material is physically or chemically bonded to the surface of the carrier and it is not substantially bonded to inside of the pores of the carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A part or all of the functional groups of a hydrophilic polymeric material according to the present invention may be chemically modified. Examples of chemical modification include glycolization, reduction and carboxylation to introduce two carboxyl groups. Glycolization refers to reactions, in which, for example, the cyclic moiety of the methacryloxy ring is treated with an acid such as diluted sulfuric acid to form two hydroxy groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A carbon chain bonded to inside of the pore of the carrier according to the present invention includes a linear or branched carbon chain optionally modified with a cyano, allyl, aryl, amino, carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, or sulfuric acid group and the like, and the carbon chain is chemically bonded to the carrier by an ester bond, ether bond, or amide bond and the like. Modification of the carbon chain can be carried out, for example, by a process in which a sililation reagent having a carbon chain is dissolved in an organic solvent such as toluene, cyclohexane, and tetrahydrofuran, and silica gel in which a carbon chain is bonded to inside of the pore, is added thereto to have the carbon chain chemically modified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The carbon chain may be linear or branched and the number of the carbon atoms in the carbon chain is 1 to 30. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The carbon chain is introduced from a compound having such a carbon chain; examples thereof include chlorosilane having C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>, and octadecyltrichlorosilane, a substance used for introducing an ion exchange group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> These carbon chains are chemically bonded to inside of the pores, which are open on the surface of the carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The pore diameter is preferably between 50 and 500 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Packings for chromatography according to the present invention can be produced, for example, by the following process. A 0.2 w/v % aqueous solution of polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide) is added to silica gel and stirred for about 1 hour. It is filtered through a glass filter, washed with water, and dried at about 130&deg; C. for about 1 hour to give a carrier wherein polybrene is bonded to the surface of silica gel. Hexane and triethylamine are added thereto, and octadecyltrichlorosilane is added gradually under stirring, then the reactants are stirred for about 30 minutes, then ethanol is added. The obtained carrier is filtered through a glass filter, washed with ethanol and dried at about 130&deg; C. for about 1 hour to give a packing according to the present invention. By packing the obtained packing into a column cartridge, a column according to the present invention can be produced. The column cartridge is normally made of stainless steel when used for HPLC analysis, however, when it is independently used for trapping trace amounts of substances contained in biological components, a column made of a synthetic resin can be used as well.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When a biological sample is directly injected into a column according to the present invention, macromolecule species such as a protein in the biological sample are excluded by the hydrophilic polymer on the surface of the packing, and flow through the column without reaching the carbon chain in the pores. On the other hand, low molecular weight compounds pass through the hydrophilic polymeric material on the surface of the packing and reach the pore of the packing and are retained by the carbon chains in the pore. Therefore, an analysis can be carried out without being affected by the macromolecular species such as a protein in the biological sample, and only the low molecular weight compounds are well retained and separated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Chromatograms of (1) blank solution, (2) p-hydroxy benzoic acid n-propyl ester sample solution (load 100 ng), (3) BSA solution (load 20 mg) and (4) BSA and p-hydroxy benzoic acid n-propyl ester mixed sample solution (loads were 20 mg and 100 ng respectively) are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows that the injected BSA (protein) was not adsorbed on the surface of the packing, and the protein was deemed to be excluded since the surface of the packing is modified with the hydrophilic group (chromatogram (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>)). As the p-hydroxy benzoic acid ester is retained in the packing according to the present invention due to the hydrophobic interaction, the inside of the packing is deemed to be modified with a carbon chain (chromatogram (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)). When a mixed sample solution containing BSA and p-hydroxy benzoic acid n-propyl ester was injected, p-hydroxy benzoic acid n-propyl ester was detected without being interfered by the BSA (chromatogram (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A graph showing the retention capacity of the trap column into which the BSA solution was repeatedly injected is given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> clearly shows that the performance of the trap column is not deteriorated by injection of a large amount of BSA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows chromatograms of a sample (300 &mgr;l), supernatant of rat plasma centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 30 minutes, which was obtained with a commercially available column (the surface of the carrier is modified with octyldecyl group) and a column according to the present invention. When the plasma is injected into the commercially available column, it is retained in the column resulting in large tailing (chromatogram (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>)), that makes the detection of trace amounts of substances in the plasma extremely difficult, while the chromatogram obtained with the column according to the present invention is free from any tailing since the plasma is not retained in the column, therefore it is suited for micro analysis of the plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> From the above-mentioned results, it is confirmed that the serum direct injection column packing according to the present invention excludes the BSA to a great extent through the hydrophilic polymeric material on the external surface of the packing, and the ODS chain on the inner surface of the packing has sufficient retention capacity. Even after a protein is injected, in an amount of 3000 mg or more as BSA, both the trap column and the analytical column showed no reduction in column performance and no remarkable increase in the column pressure was observed for sending the solutions. </paragraph>
