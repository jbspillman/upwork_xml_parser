<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to wireless base station apparatus and channel access control method for use in mobile communication systems such as mobile phones and car-phones. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recent years have seen a rapid growth of wireless communication services by means of such mobile communication systems as mobile phones and car-phones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a system configuration diagram of a mobile communication system. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> mobile communication system consists chiefly of switching control apparatus (RNC) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, base station apparatus (BTS) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and communication terminal apparatus (MS) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Switching control apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> cross-connects several base stations with backbone network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is in the public circuit. Meanwhile base station apparatus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> performs wireless communication with communication terminal apparatus <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in its cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As with current wireless communication services, the feasibility or infeasibility of access in response to call requests and the speed of communication depend on the state of saturation in communication channels, and only when the communication channels have room, is it possible to gain channel access and to increase the communication speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, the problem of depletion of frequency resources is envisaged as with the wireless communication services of the near future due to an upsurge of wireless communication users and growing demand for increasing communication speed, and a timely reaction to this problem is needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The purpose in using wireless communication services might vary on a per user basis, such as to report to the police or the fire department in which case emphasis lies on the urgency aspect, multi-media data communication in which case emphasis lies on the high-speed aspect, and private conversation in which case emphasis lies on neither the urgency nor the high-speed aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Currently, for the efficient use of frequency resources, various wireless communication services are offered according to the purpose of use, and these include the multilayer cell method whereby a communication channel of either a mobile phone or a PHS is selectively accessed, as well as the method for high-speed communication by using two PHS channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, these types of services are possible only on the conditions that wireless communication channels including frequency resources have room, and the problem that a user in urgency will be denied channel access when channels are saturated remains unsolved. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention aims to provide a wireless base station apparatus and channel accession control method that satisfy every user&apos;s need in respect to wireless communication services and that furthermore make effective use of frequency resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The above object is to provide wireless communication service that includes assigning priority and communication speed for access in reply to calls according to the type of user contract. That is, the above object can be achieved as follows: with respect to a user that desires good-quality service, a service is offered whereby channel access in reply to a call is secured with priority at the expense of special charges even where the channels are saturated, while with respect to a user that desires a low-rate contract, service is offered at low-rates, on the conditions that communication may be cut off when the channels become saturated.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Now embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the following descriptions, a user that receives good-quality service at the expense of high contract rates is called a priority user, while a user that makes a low-rate contract on the conditions that communication may be cut off or the communication speed may be reduced when a channel is saturated is called a low-rate user. Furthermore, as in conventional cases, a user with a type of contract whereby the feasibility or infeasibility of access depend solely on the status of saturation in a communication channel is called a conventional user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Of the low-rate user, furthermore, one that unconditionally accepts a channel cutoff request or a low-speed communication request is called a first low rate user. On the other hand, one that is able to choose whether or not to accept a channel cutoff request or a low-speed communication request is called a second low-rate user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a base station apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In base station apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, antenna <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> receives a signal transmitted from a communication terminal apparatus and outputs the signal to transmission/reception section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Antenna <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> then sends the signal output from transmission/reception section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to communication terminals by wireless transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Transmission/reception section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> processes the radio frequency signal input from antenna <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> into a baseband signal and then outputs the baseband signal to signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Also, transmission/reception section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> converts the baseband signal input from signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> into a radio frequency signal and outputs the radio frequency signal to antenna <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> executes modulation processing and decoding processing on the baseband signal input from transmission/reception section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and extracts the received data and various control signals. Furthermore, signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> outputs the received data, the user codes of users accessing or cut off from a channel, and information that denotes the communication speed of currently communicating users (hereinafter &ldquo;communicaiton speed data&rdquo;). Signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> then outputs a call access request signal and a high-speed communication request signal to channel status deciding section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and outputs the call access-requesting user code and a channel cutoff acceptance signal to user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Also signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> appends control information to the transmission data input from switching control apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via wire I/F section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and outputs the transmission data to transmission/reception section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> after coding processing and modulation processing. Furthermore, when the user code of a user subject to a channel cutoff or the user code of a user subject to a communication speed reduction is input from user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> outputs a channel cutoff request signal or a low-speed communication request signal for the user in question to transmission/reception section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When a call access request signal is input from signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, channel status deciding section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> makes decisions as to whether or not the channel is saturated based on the number of currently communicating users registered in user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and then outputs the decision to user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. When there is a high-speed communication request signal, channel status deciding section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> considers if there is room in the channel to perform high-speed communication and makes decisions as to whether or not the channel is saturated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> User code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> stores the user codes of currently communicating users and communicaiton speed data corresponding to each user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> User code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> identifies the type of the user that has requested a call access based on the user code input from signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, registers the identification result into user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and outputs the registration result to signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> If a priority user makes a call access request when the channel is saturated, user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> searches user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to see whether or not there is any low-rate user registered and, if there is, outputs such user to signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When a channel cutoff is accepted, user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> overwrites the user code of the priority user over the user code of the low-rate user that is subject to the channel cutoff stored in user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The user code of the removed low-rate user and the user code of the newly registered priority user are output to signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> If a priority user makes a high-speed communication request when the channel is saturated, user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> searches user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to see whether or not there is any low-rate user registered and, if there is, outputs such user to signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When a communication speed reduction is accepted, user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> overwrites the user code of the priority user over the user code of the low-rate user that is subject to the channel cutoff stored in user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The user code of the removed low-rate user and the user code of the newly registered priority user are output to signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Switching control apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> performs wireless communication with base station apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, stores currently communicating users&apos; user codes and communication speed data, and charges based on these data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Next channel access control processing by the above-described base station apparatus will be described using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and the flow chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> To begin with, in step (hereinafter &ldquo;ST&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and in ST <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, upon receiving a call access request signal from a user that wants to newly start communication, signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> outputs the call access request signal to channel status deciding section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and registers the user code with user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Next in ST <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, channel status deciding section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> makes decisions as to whether or not the channel is saturated based on the number of currently communicating users registered with user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and outputs the decision to user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When the decision from ST <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> reveals that the channel has room, in ST <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> registers with user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> the user code of the user that has made a call access request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In ST <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> transmits a signal to the effect of allowing channel access to the user that has made a call access request and implements channel access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the decision from ST <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> reveals that the channel is saturated, in ST <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> identifies as to whether or not the user that has made a call access request is a priority user based on the user code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> When the identification in ST <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> reveals the user that has made a call access request to be a priority user, in ST <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> searches user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to see whether there is any low-rate user registered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When the identification in ST <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> reveals the user that has made a call access request not to be a priority user, and when the search in ST <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> reveals that there is no low-rate user registered, in ST <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> finishes the processing by way of transmitting a signal to the effect of denying channel access to the user that has made a call access request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the search in ST <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> reveals that a low-rate user is registered, in ST <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and in ST <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> transmits a signal to the effect of cutting off the channel to the searched-out low-rate user. If a channel cutoff request is made thereupon, a first low-rate user unconditionally accepts the request while a second low-rate user chooses whether or not to accept the request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In ST <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and in ST <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, upon receiving a signal to the effect of accepting a channel cutoff from the relevant low-rate user, signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> implements a channel cutoff in respect to the relevant user and instructs switching control apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to charge the priority user that has made a call access request special charges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In ST <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> overwrites the user code of the user that has made a call access request over the user code subject to a channel cutoff in user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Where the channel status has reached point of saturation, it is possible to offer wireless communication service that includes priority of access in reply to calls based on the type of user contract, by thus selecting users to allow channel access based on user priority. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in ST <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and in ST <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, upon receiving from a user a high-speed communication request signal in request of high-speed communication, signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> outputs the high-speed communication request signal to channel status deciding section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and outputs the user code to user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Next in ST <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, channel status deciding section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> makes decisions as to whether or not the channel is saturated based on the number of currently communicating users registered with user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and outputs the decision to user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When the decision from ST <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> reveals that the channel has room, in ST <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> renews the speed communication speed data of the user that has made a high-speed communication request in user code storing section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> into &ldquo;High speed communication in progress.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Then in ST <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, signal processing section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> transmits a signal to the effect of allowing high-speed communication to the user that has made a call access request and implements high-speed communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when the decision from ST <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> reveals that the channel is saturated, in ST <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, user code registration section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> identifies as to whether or not the user that has made a call access request is a priority user based on the user code. </paragraph>
