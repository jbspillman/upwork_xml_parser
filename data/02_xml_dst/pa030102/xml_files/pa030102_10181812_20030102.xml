<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a panel-shaped building component consisting of a core layer of foamed plastic and outside plastic layers attached on either side to the core layer, between the core layer and the outside plastic layers there being flat stiffening layers. The invention relates furthermore to a process for producing this panel-shaped building component. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Building components of this type are already known, as the stiffening layers among others metal sheets, preferably of aluminum, being used. These stiffening layers are cemented over the entire surface to the core layer or the bordering outside layers. This cementing can be done relatively easily in the continuous production of the panel-shaped component, for example by bilateral application of an adhesive layer to the metal sheets. Under conditions of use under which the panel-shaped component is exposed to high shearing forces and/or thermal stresses, a high composite strength is necessary, and it cannot be easily achieved with cementing. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is to make available a panel-shaped building component which compared to known building components, is characterized by increased composite strength and at the same time can be produced in a simple and efficient manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As claimed in the invention a panel-shaped building component of the initially mentioned type is proposed which is characterized in that the stiffening layers are perforated and are joined free of adhesive both to the core layer and also to the outside layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The connection between the core layer and outside layers takes place advantageously by their being welded to one another especially by the formation of welding grooves in the area of the perforations of the stiffening layers. The prerequisite for this is that the materials used in the core layer and the outside layers are thermoplastics which can be welded to one another. Advantageously the thermoplastic materials can be polyolefins, for example polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) and/or polyamides (PA) and/or polystyrene (PS) and/or styrene polymerizates, for example acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene polymers (ABS), acrylic ester-styrene-acrylonitrile polymer (ASA) or styrene-acrylonitrile-copolymer (SAN) as well as thermoplastic polyesters, for example polyethylene terephthalate (PETP) or polybutyleneterephthalate (PBTP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, metal sheets which consist preferably of steel, aluminum or a metal alloy are used as perforated stiffening layers between the core and outside layers in the panel-shaped building component as claimed in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One advantageous configuration of the perforation in the stiffening layers consists in that they are made hole-like or slot-like, preferred embodiments for these perforated stiffening layers being those in the form of gratings or screens. Furthermore, it is also possible to use as the perforated stiffening layers between the core and outside layers fabrics or fiber composites, for example fiber-reinforced panels, and they can be of an inorganic or organic nature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The subject matter of the invention is furthermore a process for producing a panel-shaped component of the initially mentioned type which is characterized in that bilaterally perforated stiffening layers are placed on the plastic melt of the core layer which is prepared and foamed in an extruder, consequently the plastic melts of the outside layers prepared in other extruder units are applied to the perforated stiffening layers, and that a connection between the respective layers is formed by subsequent pressing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Materials for the core and outside layers are preferably thermoplastics which can be welded to one another. Suitable thermoplastic materials are especially polyolefins, for example polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) and/or polyamides (PA) and/or polystyrene (PS) and/or styrene polymerizates, for example acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene polymers (ABS), acrylic ester-styrene-acrylonitrile polymer (ASA) or styrene-acrylonitrile-copolymer (SAN), as well as thermoplastic polyesters, for example polyethylene terephthalate (PETP) or polybutyleneterephthalate (PBTP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, preferably metal sheets, specifically of steel, aluminum or metal alloys, are used as perforated stiffening layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Especially hole-like or slot-like stiffening layers, preferably in the form of a grating or screen, can be used as perforated stiffening layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible to use as the perforated stiffening layers those in the form of fabrics or fiber composites, for example of fiber-reinforced panels, and the materials used therein can be of an inorganic or organic nature.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The production of the building component as claimed in the invention is detailed using one embodiment: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The panel-shaped building component <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as claimed in the invention can be produced in a known system consisting of extruders and a downstream double belt press as the calender. In the extruder unit the plastic melt for the core layer which can additionally contain propellants for foaming is prepared. This plastic melt can be produced for example from polypropylene in granulate form. The perforated stiffening layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a thickness of preferably 0.1-1.0 mm are applied on both sides to this plastic melt, by which the stiffness of the building component is clearly increased. The stiffening layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be for example perforated aluminum foils roughly 0.5 mm thick. Then the plastic melts for the outside layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are applied to these perforated aluminum foils which are used as stiffening layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. These plastic melts can like the core layer consist of polypropylene and are obtained in separate extruder units from the corresponding plastic base materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Based on the perforations made in the stiffening layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, for example in the aforementioned aluminum foil, both the melt of the outside layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and also the melt of the core layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can penetrate through the perforation so that a type of &ldquo;melt composite&rdquo; is formed. The composite adhesion which is advantageous for the panel-shaped building component <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is produced by pressing this &ldquo;melt composite&rdquo; in a downstream double belt press such that the layers are welded to one another in the area of the welding grooves <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the panel-shaped building component <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is calibrated accordingly by the contact pressure applied in the double belt press. Then it is cooled and can be worked for example by sawing. </paragraph>
