<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> More generally, the present invention relates to a device and a method for removing trimmings from series of manufactured articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Devices of this kind are commonly used in the paper converting industry in order to eliminate the trimmings before packaging of the rolls of paper material, such as rolls of toilet paper, paper towels and the like. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">STATE OF THE ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the production of rolls of wound web-like material, for example rolls of toilet paper, paper towels or other paper material, winding of the web-like material into so-called logs, i.e. rolls with a diameter equal to that of the finished rolls and with a considerable axial length, is performed. The latter are then cut perpendicularly to their axis by means of so-called saw machines. During cutting of the logs, a front trimming and an end trimming are generated and must be eliminated before the subsequent roll-packaging operation and possibly recycled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to eliminate the trimmings, various devices of mechanical type have been developed. More recently, devices which perform elimination of the trimmings from the series of cut rolls with the aid of pneumatic means have been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An example of a pneumatic device for eliminating trimmings is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,475,917. In one of the embodiments described in this publication, the front and end trimmings of the series of rolls cut from the logs and subsequently fed to the device are eliminated by interrupting in a suitable zone the suction exerted by a flexible suction conveyor which removes the rolls from a feeder and transfers them to a receiver. By suitably positioning and dimensioning the non-sucking zone and using a conveyor of suitable length, it is possible to ensure that the front and end trimmings are always located in the position where the suction through the conveyor is interrupted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another system for eliminating the trimmings based on the use of pneumatic means in combination with mechanical means is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,033. This system envisages a suction conveyor divided into three portions, a central portion and two side portions, which may be staggered with respect to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the production and packaging of rolls of wound web-like material there also exists the need to sort the rolls onto separate conveyors depending on the specific requirements during the processing phase. U.S. Pat. No. 4,033,862 describes a sorting device which is able to receive, at its input, a series of rolls from which the trimmings have already been eliminated, in order to distribute them in accordance with a predetermined criterion on a series of conveyors arranged in succession. This device is not able to eliminate the trimmings. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The general object of the present invention is to provide a versatile device and a versatile method for eliminating trimmings from series of manufactured articles. According to a particular aspect, the object of the present invention is to provide a device and a method for eliminating trimmings located at the front and/or at the end of series of articles fed to the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a further particular aspect, the object of the present invention is to provide a device of the abovementioned type for eliminating trimmings from series of rolls obtained by cutting a roll or log with larger axial dimensions, which can be easily adapted to rolls of various sizes and/or to series of rolls of various lengths, without the need for large overall volumes and for replacement or modification of the suction means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is also to provide a device of the abovementioned type which does not require long times for adaptation to the various operating conditions and in particular to the various sizes of the rolls or to the variation in the number of rolls in a series. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and further objects and advantages, which will become clear to persons skilled in the art from a reading of the text which follows, are obtained according to the invention by envisaging that a continuous flexible conveyor equipped with suction openings, preferably along the whole of its extension, for the transportation of articles (for example rolls of web-like material) has, associated with it, at least one obturator element which is movable along the path for transferring the articles from an inlet to an outlet and which temporarily closes the openings of the conveyor opposite at least one trimming of a series of articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to a particularly advantageous application of the invention, the device serves to eliminate front and end trimmings from series of rolls obtained by cutting logs. In this case, the obturator element or obturator elements are arranged between the suction conveyor and an end trimming of a first series of rolls and between the conveyor and a front trimming of a following series of rolls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The conveyor with the associated suction system may be positioned so as to be arranged above the rolls which are fed to it, so as to retain the latter from above. However, this is not strictly necessary since the pneumatic grip exerted by the suction means may also be oriented non-vertically, provided that it is opposed by the force of gravity, due to the effect of which the trimmings are discharged. For example, the conveyor may be located laterally with respect to the rolls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> With the device as claimed in the present invention, contrary to what occurs in the devices of the prior art, the zone in which the conveyor is not sucking, which shall be positioned in each case opposite the trimmings to be eliminated, is defined by the movable obturator element, the movement of which is independent of the movement of the suction conveyor. It is therefore possible to position, in accordance with requirements, the obturator element with respect to the suction conveyor depending on the sizes of the rolls and the length of the series of rolls to be handled such that, with limited dimensions of the device and substantially without adaptation operations, the device may be adapted to widely varying operating situations, in particular to series of rolls of different lengths, without the need for replacement of the flexible suction conveyor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to a practical and advantageous embodiment, the movable obturator element is mounted on a continuous flexible member, for example a chain or a pair of chains, which extends parallel to the conveyor at least along the path for transferring the rolls from the inlet zone to the outlet zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Although it is theoretically possible to use a single obturator element, according to an advantageous embodiment of the invention the obturator elements are two in number, being mounted in two opposite positions on the same continuous flexible member. This also allows series of rolls with small axial dimensions to be handled at appropriate speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The obturator element or obturator elements may consist of a membrane which is impermeable to air and which is applied between two continuous flexible members. Along the roll transfer path, the membrane which forms the obturator element is arranged between the trimmings and the suction conveyor and moves at the same speed as the suction conveyor. The membrane may also be partially permeable to air, to a limited degree so as to prevent the pneumatic retention of the articles handled by the conveyor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In order to increase further the flexibility of the device, two independently controlled obturator elements may be envisaged, having the function of eliminating, respectively, an end trimming and a front trimming from successive series of rolls. In this way the distance between the successive series of rolls (or other articles) may be any and the device is adapted flexibly to the various operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Further advantageous features of the device as claimed in the invention are indicated in the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a method for eliminating the front and end trimmings from a series of rolls of web-like material, in which the rolls are engaged by means of suction by a continuous flexible suction conveyor and transported along a transfer path. Characteristically in accordance with the invention, the elimination of the trimmings occurs by inserting into the transfer path an obturator element which is separated from the conveyor and moving the obturator element together with the conveyor along the transfer path in order to intercept temporarily the suction opposite the trimmings, causing in this way elimination of the trimmings from the transfer path as a result of failing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the detailed description which follows, the invention will be described in combination with a sorting system able to sort the rolls onto two or more alternative exit paths. This sorting system is not necessary for implementation of the present invention, but is described merely by way of a possible further improvement so as to provide the device for eliminating trimmings with further characteristics and functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As will be clear to persons skilled in the art, the principles described above&mdash;which will be described below by way of application to a device specifically designed for eliminating trimmings from series of rolls cut from an original log of considerable axial length&mdash;may be applied with advantage also in other situations where similar requirements exist. In general, the principle on which the present invention is based may be used whenever it is required to eliminate one or more trimmings from a series consisting of one or more articles fed to the device, where &ldquo;trimmings&rdquo; is understood in general as referring to any waste element which may be positioned at the front and/or at the end, but also in an intermediate position along the series of articles processed by the device.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The device comprises a pair of side walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, between which a suction box <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> divided into two chambers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B by a separation baffle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is arranged. The chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A is connected to a suction duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A, while the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B is connected to a suction duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B. The separation baffle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be omitted and the suction duct may be single instead of double. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> denotes the end wall of the suction box <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which wall is divided into two portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B corresponding to the chambers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B into which the suction box is divided. Openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A are formed in the wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A, while openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B are formed in the wall portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One or more flexible conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> travel along the bottom surface of the wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The number of flexible conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (two in the example illustrated) corresponds to the number of roll feed channels. The two conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are arranged parallel to each other, as shown in the cross section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and are arranged so as to receive simultaneously two rows of rolls supplied from a two-channel saw machine (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The flexible conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are driven around a first idle roller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a second motorized roller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The roller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> receives the movement from a motor which, in the example illustrated, is indicated by <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and arranged coaxially with the roller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Each flexible conveyor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has openings <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A which extend along its whole extension. The openings <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A are flanked by lips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B which also extend along the whole extension of the conveyor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the bottom zone of the path of the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, where the latter make contact with the bottom surface of the wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the suction box <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a suction obtained by means of the vacuum generated inside the chambers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B is produced through the openings <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A. In a manner known per se, the suction exerted through the openings <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A has the function of retaining the rolls fed to the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the manner which will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Chain wheels <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are also supported idle, by means of suitable bearings, on the shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on which the roller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is supported. Similar chain wheels are mounted on the shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> supporting the roller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Assembly is such that the motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which causes rotation of the roller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> does not act on the chain wheels mounted on said shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the latter wheels being supported idle and thus being able to be actuated with an actuator different from and independently of the motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Another two pairs of chain wheels, denoted by <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, are also mounted between the side walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Respective chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are driven around the chain wheels and extend along a closed path, the bottom section of which is approximately parallel to the path of the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the zone where the latter make contact with the external surface of the bottom wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the suction box <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The movement of the chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is indicated by the arrow f<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, while that of the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is indicated by the arrow f<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A roll feeder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is located in the inlet zone of the device. The rolls R are fed in series, each series having a front trimming RT and an end trimming RC representing the portions of surplus material which must be eliminated by means of the device described. The feeder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is generally shown as a continuous conveyor, but may assume any suitable form and may be suitably equipped with thrusters which facilitate feeding of the series of rolls. The arrangement is known per se and various alternatives are available for the person skilled in the art. </paragraph>

The flexible conveyor members <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are actuated by the same motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which operates the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, by means of a belt drive <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Each of the flexible conveyor members <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> has, in the example illustrated, at least one section approximately parallel to the bottom wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the suction box <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and therefore to the respective section of the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> making contact with the external surface of said wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The arrangement of the flexible conveyor members <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> with respect to the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is such that, along the feed path of the rolls R transported in the direction of the arrow fR by the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, said rolls encounter firstly the flexible conveyor member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and only subsequently the flexible conveyor member <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A laminar valve <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> equipped with openings <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and capable of moving in an alternating manner in the direction of the double arrow f<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> so as to cause, respectively, the openings <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to communicate with the openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> B or be staggered with respect to the latter is arranged inside the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B of the suction box <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, the openings <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> B have substantially the same amplitude and a similar shape. The laminar valve <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> therefore allows the openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B to communicate with the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B or to intercept said openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B, interrupting the suction through them, effected via the duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Operation of the device described hitherto is as follows (see in particular FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The feeder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> feeds series of rolls R underneath the bottom section of the conveyor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Since the feeder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> extends right underneath the suction box <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and since it is positioned so that the fed rolls R are located with their upper part making contact with the lips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B of the respective conveyor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the suction generated through the openings <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A of the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> retains the rolls which form a seal against said lips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B. Consequently, the rolls R are transferred in the direction of the arrow fR toward the receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> If the laminar valve <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is located in a position such as to close the openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B in the portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B of the wall <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> corresponding to the suction chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B, the suction and therefore the retaining effect on the rolls R ceases opposite the first flexible conveyor member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the rolls R are released to the flexible conveyor member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and further conveyed in the direction of the arrow f<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> toward following processing stations. This is the situation illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If, on the other hand, the laminar valve <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is in a position such as to keep the openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> B open and in communication with the suction chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A, the retaining effect due to suction on the rolls R is maintained as far as the end zone of the suction box <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, opposite the flexible conveyor member <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The rolls R are in this case released by the conveyor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the flexible conveyor member <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> which transfers them in the direction of the arrow f<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> toward a further processing station. This is the situation illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Elimination of the front and end trimmings is obtained as follows (FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>): the position of the end trimming RC of a first series of rolls and the front trimming RT of the following series is known from the data supplied by the saw machine arranged upstream of the device (and not shown). It is therefore possible, by means of the motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, to cause the movement of the chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the membrane obturators <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B so that one of the two obturators <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B is arranged between the bottom section of the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the end trimming RC and front trimming RT when the latter are positioned by the feeder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> underneath the suction box <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the distance between the trimmings RC and RT corresponds approximately to the length of the obturators <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B. Consequently, the retaining suction effect is not exerted on the trimmings RC and RT, which fall toward a collection zone in the space between the terminal end of the feeder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the start of the flexible conveyor member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. A container or a suitable conveyor (not shown) collect and/or convey away the trimmings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The movement of the chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and consequently the obturators <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B continues&mdash;at the same speed as the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&mdash;until the obturator which has intercepted the suction opposite the trimmings just discarded is positioned beyond the suction box <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. From this position, the membrane obturators <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B will be displaced by means of movement of the chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> so as to be positioned for subsequent operation in order to eliminate successive front and end trimmings. The presence of two obturators allows one or other of the two obturators to be used alternately, resulting in more rapid positioning of said obturators in preparation for operation thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> show, in three different and successive operating conditions, a modified embodiment of the invention. Similar numbers indicate parts which are the same as or correspond to those in the previous embodiment. The device as claimed in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> differs from the previous device in that two pairs of chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B, which are driven around respective chain wheels and which are visible in particular in the cross section shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> (equivalent to the cross section shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), are provided. A first membrane obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X is attached to the chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A driven around the wheels <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A and the wheels <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A, while a second membrane obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y is attached to the chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B. The two pairs of chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B are actuated by independent motors denoted by <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In this way, the two pairs of chains and consequently the two membrane obturators may be displaced along the path defined by said chains in an independent manner by means of the two motors. As a result, it is possible to obtain certain advantages which will emerge clearly from the description of operation, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the instant in which the end trimmings RC reach the suction conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The two membrane obturators <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y are located adjacent to each other, with the front edge of the membrane obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X in a position such as to come into contact with the end trimmings RC. When the end trimmings RC are situated in front of the membrane obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X, the latter begins to move in the direction of feeding of the rolls, at the same speed as the latter, being controlled therein by the respective chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and by the motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>A. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the first phase of movement of the obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X which accompanied the end trimmings RC to the falling zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Vice versa, the chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> B and the membrane obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y may remain at a standstill. The advancing movement of the membrane obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y will start in synchronism with the advancing movement of the front trimmings RT of the following series of rolls. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the instant in which the obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X has reached and surpassed the pair of wheels <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A, while the membrane obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y is advancing in front of the first roll of the following series, which has yet to reach the point of separation from the pneumatic retaining system. The membrane obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X may advance to this point at high speed until it reassumes the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> in order to start a following roll discharge cycle, independently of the speed of advancing movement of the membrane obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y, owing to the use of two independent driving systems for the two obturators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The substantial advantage which is obtained with this configuration compared to that described previously consists in the fact that the distance between the end trimmings RC and the front trimmings RT may be any and is not dependent upon the longitudinal dimension of the obturators <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y. In fact, these two obturators act independently of each other on the end trimmings and on the front trimmings, respectively. Any greater or lesser distance between the end and the front of successive series of rolls is compensated for by simply delaying more or less the start of the movement of the second obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y with respect to the first obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X. As can be seen from FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, in fact, the distance between the front and end trimmings is greater than the sum of the longitudinal lengths of the two obturators. Nevertheless, having delayed the start of the advancing movement of the second obturator with respect to the first one, it has been possible to discharge both the front trimmings and the end trimmings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the first obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X, once it has reached the position in which the rolls leave the pneumatic retaining system, is able to advance at a speed greater than and independent of the speed of the rolls, in this configuration it is not necessary to provide on the same pairs of chains several obturators which act alternately in successive operating cycles, as instead envisaged in the preceding configuration. In fact, there is sufficient time for the obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X to position itself again at the working point while the obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y is still advancing at the (slower) speed of the rolls. Moreover, the active operating phase of the obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X is able to start even before the second obturator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y is correctly positioned in the operating position for eliminating the front trimmings of the following series of rolls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The system thus configured has an even greater flexibility and adaptability to any operating condition, it being possible to program from a keyboard or other suitable interface all the movements of the obturators so as to allow adaptation to any size of the rolls and to any length of the series of rolls as well as to any distance between successive series of rolls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The example in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> shows a configuration in which the rolls are sorted onto the flexible conveyor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, as an alternative to the previous configuration where the conveyor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> was active. The system for discharging the trimmings may also operate without the means for sorting onto two or more roll sorting and discharge paths, as may the sorting system also operate with a different system for discharging the trimmings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The device described, when it has both the sorting system and the system for eliminating the trimmings (in either one of the configurations described), allows simple and rapid sorting of the rolls R alternately onto the conveying member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> or onto the conveying member <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, depending on the requirement in each case in the production cycle. The transition from one of the two flexible conveyor members to the other may be requested, for example, depending on the type of manufactured article fed in each case to the device or depending on the operating conditions of the machines downstream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is clear that the concept described here with reference to a system with two flexible conveyor members <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be further developed by envisaging three or more flexible conveyor members arranged in series in the direction of feeding fR of the rolls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The device described also allows easy and rapid adaptation to the various sizes of the series of rolls arriving from the feeder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Contrary to the devices of the prior art, in fact, the zone in which suction through the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is interrupted in order to allow discharging of the trimmings may be positioned as required, being defined by the membrane obturators <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B or <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>X, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>Y. This allows, in addition to a high degree of flexibility, also a considerable limitation of the overall dimensions, since the length of the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the one hand and of the chains <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the other hand are not dependent upon the dimensions of the rolls and upon the overall length of the series of rolls fed to the device, contrary to that which occurs in the devices of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The adaptation of the device to the diametral dimension of the rolls is obtained&mdash;in a manner known per se&mdash;by means of heightwise adjustment of the side walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with respect to the flexible conveyor members <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the feeder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the drawing shows only a simplification provided by way of a practical demonstration of the invention, the form and dimensions of said invention being able to vary without thereby departing from the scope of the idea underlying said invention. </paragraph>
