<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns a seat comprising a seat back, a cushion, a pivoting handle mounted on one of the lateral sides of the seat back and adapted to cause the seat back to tilt onto the cushion from a raised position, a rotary plate fixed under the cushion, and a pivoting lever affixed to the rotary plate and adapted to cause the cushion to rotate on itself with the seat back in the raised position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It relates more specifically to a seat of this type mounted as a motor vehicle front seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Usually, the driver or passenger of an automobile experiences more problems in getting into the passenger compartment if it has a limited volume and/or accessibility. Thus, it is not easy for a passenger to reach the rear seats of a &ldquo;small&rdquo; vehicle that only has two hinged or sliding doors at the front of the vehicle, and this in spite of the fact that the seat back can be tilted onto the base of the front seat involved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In some types of vehicles equipped with front seats that rotate on themselves, however, it is possible to improve the accessibility to the rear seats, but at the expense of complicated operations. Indeed, the passenger must turn the handle mounted on the outer lateral side of the seat back with one hand in order to tilt the seat back onto the cushion, and, while bending down, he must simultaneously turn the lever located on the cushion with his other hand in order to rotate the cushion on itself while orienting it towards the outside of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The purpose of the invention is thus to propose a seat of the type mentioned above which allows the passenger to have a large accessibility to the rear seats of an automobile while being easy to manipulate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To this effect, an object of the invention is a seat, in particular for an automobile, comprising a seat back, a cushion, a pivoting handle mounted one of the lateral sides of the seat back and adapted to cause the seat back to tilt onto the cushion from a raised position, a rotary plate fixed under the cushion, and a pivoting lever fixed to the rotary plate and adapted to cause the cushion to rotate around the axis of rotation of the rotary plate with the seat back in the raised position, characterized in that it comprises means for causing the pivoting lever to rotate immediately after the pivoting of the handle so as to obtain a rotation of the cushion around the axis of rotation of the rotary plate immediately the seat back has been tilted onto the cushion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The seat can also comprise one or more of the following characteristics taken alone or in combination: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> the means are comprised of a cable having one of its ends affixed to the rear part of the seat back and the other end affixed to the pivoting lever; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> the cable is housed in a sheath; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> the seat consists of tubes affixed to the lower part of the rotary plate, which extend across it, the ends of these tubes being adapted to be affixed to a floor such as a floor of an automobile; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> the axis of rotation of the rotary plate is offset relative to the axis of the cushion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention also concerns a motor vehicle equipped with at least one seat described above, preferably mounted as a front seat.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a front seat of an automobile wherein access to the rear seats is very limited while the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is in a raised position, i.e., approximately vertical to the cushion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and when the cushion is in a driving position, i.e., fixed and approximately parallel to the lateral side of the vehicle body, which is not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> This front seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises, in a manner that is itself known, a handle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> pivotally mounted on the lateral side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> closest to the front door, which is not shown, when the cushion is in the driving position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It also comprises a rotary plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> affixed below the cushion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and having an axis of rotation (P) that is offset from the axis (C) by a distance d that is sufficiently large to increase the interior living space when the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> faces the rear seats of the vehicle and that is sufficiently small so that the seat back in the raised position does not come into contact with other elements of the vehicle when the cushion turns, such as the corresponding lateral support of the car body or the dashboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As to the rotary plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it comprises, in its lower part, two tubes <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that are affixed by means of screws, which are not shown, and that extend transversely across the plate along two of its sides. The ends <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of these tubes are affixed to two side rails <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, also by means of screws, which are not shown. The side rails <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are themselves affixed directly to the floor of an automobile, also by means of screws. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A pivoting lever <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is fitted tightly in a flexible, curved tab <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> arranged in front of the rotary plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The rotation of this lever <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> towards the cushion causes, in a manner itself known, a rotation of the cushion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> around the axis of rotation of the rotary plate (P) with the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the raised position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Finally, the seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the invention comprises a cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having one of its ends <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> fixed in a clamp <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This attachment of the end <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the clamp <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be done by any means available to the person of the art. This can include, for example, a screw going through the clamp that presses the end <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> against the inside of the recess made in the clamp <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in which the cable is housed. The clamp <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is itself affixed to the rear part of the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by welding. The cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is arranged in a protective sheath <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> that prevents damage to the cover of the seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that has a stop <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> against the rear of the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The other end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is itself fixed into an attachment clamp <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> welded to the pivoting lever <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at the end <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> opposite the one <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> on which the operating knob of the lever <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> is placed. The entire central part of the cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is itself arranged along the seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> below the cushion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and along the upper part of the rotary plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the protective sheath <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> being affixed to the rotary plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by means of attachments, which are themselves known, and which are not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The length of the cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is judiciously selected so as not to disturb the complete rotation of the cushion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> around the axis of rotation of the rotary plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, i.e., in the order of 180&deg;. This rotation corresponds to an orientation of the front seat such that the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> faces the rear seats of the vehicle, with the rear of the seat back facing the dashboard of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Operation of the front seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the invention will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When a passenger intends to access the rear seats of the vehicle, he operates the handle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by causing it to turn around its axis so as to cause the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to tilt onto the cushion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the unoccupied front seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and to go from its raised position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to an inclined position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). This tilting of the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> onto the cushion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causes tension in the cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> according to the arrow f at its end <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that is integral with the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This tension of the cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is sufficient to cause the pivoting of the lever <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> immediately afterwards. The rotation of the cushion around the axis of rotation of the rotary plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is thus obtained immediately after the tilting of the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> onto the cushion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The passenger can thus, without difficulty, maneuver the seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> tilted down, and easily orient it towards the outside, for example, at an angle of rotation &thgr; between 45 and 135&deg; (the angle of rotation here is the angle measured from the initial position of the seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i.e., fixed with the rear of the seat back facing the rear seats) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Accessibility to the rear seats is thus greatly improved since the passenger can easily orient the front seat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when he gets into the vehicle with the seat back <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> tilted down, without having to manipulate other elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The embodiment mode which has just been described is very advantageous to the extent that it makes it possible to obtain the desired kinematics while adding a minimum number of parts that do not change the structure of the seat. The additional cost caused by the installation of the cable according to the invention is thus very low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Of course, different embodiments of a seat of this type, which makes it possible to provide a large accessibility to the rear seats of a vehicle while remaining very easy to manipulate, can be imagined without exceeding the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is possible to imagine a mechanism that allows the rotary plate to slide on rails arranged longitudinally to the vehicle immediately after the seat back has been tilted onto the seat cushion. </paragraph>
