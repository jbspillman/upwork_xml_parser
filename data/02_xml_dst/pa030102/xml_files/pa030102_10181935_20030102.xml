<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a microorganism detecting kit capable of counting living cells, dead cells and particular microorganisms at one time by the color development of the cells from a specimen with a plurality of types of microorganisms (the concept of which means the inclusion of bacteria and true fungi), i.e., microorganisms such as bacteria and true fungi possibly deposited thereon or incorporated therein, and a microorganism counting apparatus and a microorganism counting process capable of counting the color-developed microorganisms. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As for such kit for detecting the microorganisms, there are known a self-adhesive sheet as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.10-70975, and a plate counting process, which is a common process for determining the number of deposited cells. The detail of such detecting kit is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. The self-adhesive sheet <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is comprised of a self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a support <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Microorganisms in a specimen are brought into a contact with the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and collected on a surface of the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. An antibody and/or an aqueous solution of a color-developing substrate for microorganisms to be detected is brought into contact with the surface of the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the color development of the microorganisms on the surface of the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is observed visually or by a microscope, thereby confirming the presence or absence of the microorganisms and the number of the microorganisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There is also known a deposited-bacterium measuring kit (not shown) based on a plate counting process as one of culturing processes, which are common processes for determining the number of bacteria or fungi. The deposited-bacterium measuring kit is adapted to judge the presence or absence of microorganisms and count the number of microorganisms by bringing the surface of a culture medium into direct contact with a specimen, collecting microorganisms on the surface of the culture medium, culturing the microorganism deposited to the surface of the culture medium as they are, and observing them visually or by a microscope or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such conventional microorganism detecting kit requires steps of bringing the self-adhesive sheet into contact with the specimen, collecting the microorganisms and then applying a reagent. For this reason, a time and a technique are required for an examining operation. An immune process for detecting particular microorganisms using an antibody has a high sensitiveness, because the antibody is bonded specifically with an antigen. In the immune process, however, the use of the antibody is essentially required and for this reason, there are problems in respect of the nature itself of the antibody such as the production and management of the antibody and an immune reaction detecting means. The immune process is not capable of judging the life or death of cells. In addition, if the dyeing of the antibody is used, the self-adhesive layer is dyed to a dyed color and after the dyeing, colors other than the specimen deposited to the self-adhesive layer are required to be removed. Further, the antibody and the color-developing substrate are used, and the entire area to be detected is dyed and for this reason, particular microorganisms can be detected, but cannot be detected simultaneously with the common bacteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are such conventionally known apparatus for counting microorganisms, which is designed to apply exciting light directly to a sample containing microorganisms, acquire fluorescent rays emitted from the fluorescent substances produced in the microorganisms as image data, measure a concentration of the fluorescent substances in the microorganisms and measure the activity of the microorganisms from the addition of the intensity of the fluorescent ray, as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.5-111394. The detail of such microorganism counting process is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. A suspension of methanogens germs is placed on a preparation <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, and exciting light <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is applied to the suspension. Fluorescent rays generated are recognized using a high-sensitiveness television camera <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and VTR <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and stored. The intensity of the intended fluorescent ray is detected from an image picture projected on a monitor television <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> using a picture-processing device <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Such conventional microorganism counting process cannot be suited for microorganisms producing no fluorescent substance. In addition, in the conventional microorganism counting process, microorganisms incapable of producing a fluorescent substance because of a weaker activity are not detected in some cases, even if they are target microorganisms. The activity or number of the microorganisms cannot be necessarily detected. The microorganism counting apparatus is used in food factories in many cases. In such case, it is an important factor for the management how many are all microorganisms present rather than particular microorganisms. Therefore, for as the standard of living microorganisms on a fresh vegetable, the number of common bacteria is 1,000,000/ml or less. According to the introduction of a latest HACCP, not only the examination of the number of living germs on a food itself but also the examination in a factory itself and in an operating procedure, e.g., the examination of living germs on a wall, a floor surface, cooking devices such as a chopping board and a kitchen knife have been conducted, and the management of a food itself and the management of environments are important. However, the conventional technique is complicated and requires a specialized knowledge and thus, it is not true that anybody can measure microorganism easily in a field using the conventional technique. Even in respect of the apparatus, exciting light is applied to fluorescent substances produced by microorganisms, and fluorescent rays emitted from the fluorescent substances are analyzed by processing of a picture. For this reason, a technique for enlarging the picture at high magnifications as in a microscope is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The common culturing process for detecting the deposited germs suffers from a problem that a lot of time is taken for culturing deposited microorganisms. Further, some of types of microorganisms may be not bred on a culture medium having the microorganisms deposited thereon in some cases, which may cause an underestimation. Furthermore, the culturing process detects only living germs and for this reason, the number and the life or death of microorganisms existing in the environments cannot be necessarily confirmed by the culturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There are such conventionally known microorganism counting processes and apparatus, in which an added compound is permeated into microorganism bodies and then decomposed by an enzyme reaction in the microorganism bodies, and microorganisms emitting fluorescent rays are detected, as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.10-323197. These microorganisms are recognized as living microorganisms. In addition, the numbers of living and dead microorganisms are grasped by using a reagent for dyeing the dead cells in combination with an above-described reagent. There are other conventionally known techniques, in which particular microorganisms are detected in a luminescent manner using an antibody, as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.7-140148, and in which the number of particular microorganisms and the numbers of living and dead microorganisms are grasped using a reagent for dyeing the microorganisms non-specifically in combination with an antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a food sanitation field or the like, it is desired to detect particular microorganisms promptly. Coliform baciteria and particular <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>are measured as the particular microorganisms, and depending on the type of food, particular microorganisms such as staphylococcus are measured. However, in a situation in which particular microorganisms coexist together with common bacteria or in a situation in which impurities exist, it is required that the particular microorganisms are separated or separated and cultured using a separating means, or the impurities are removed. The common bacteria and the particular microorganisms cannot be counted simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In such conventional microorganism counting process and apparatus, a process for discriminating microorganisms promptly described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 10-323197 uses a fluorescent reagent comprising fluorescein or the derivative thereof and a fluorescent dye comprising propidium iodide under limited conditions. However, the fluorescent reagent comprising fluorescein or the derivative thereof is subject to a course in which it is decomposed by esterase produced by microorganisms to emit rays, and hence, the fluorescent reagent largely depends on the activity of the enzyme. Namely, an enzyme activation temperature or the substrate specificity varied depending on the type of microorganisms is exemplified as an error influence factor. Therefore, in environments in which the same type of microorganisms only exists, a high-sensitiveness measurement is expected, but there is a high possibility that an underestimation or an overestimation may be caused in actual service environments. The esterase may be produced even outside microorganism cells. In such a case, the microorganisms are integrated with a background and for this reason, there is a possibility that an accurate detection cannot be achieved. Therefore, there is a problem that even if the fluorescent reagent is used in combination with the propidium iodide, or the double dyeing is carried out, the numbers of living and dead microorganisms cannot be necessarily grasped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the microorganism counting process described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.7-140148 employs an antibody to detect specific microorganisms and a dyeing reagent to be non-specifically bonded to microorganisms. In this process, it is requisite to use the antibody, but the antibody is high in sensitiveness, because it is bonded specifically, and on the other hand, the life and the death cannot be discriminated. Further, a process using this technique cannot discriminate the life and death of microorganisms dyed by the non-specifically dyeing reagent contained in a specimen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is also desired to measure particular microorganisms and common bacteria simultaneously and promptly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention solves such a conventional subject, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein a type or a plurality of types of staining or coloring compounds are incorporated into a specimen contact portion, whereby the collection and detection of cells can be conducted simultaneously to reduce the reagent applying step, and microorganisms can be detected promptly. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein to detect particular microorganisms, it is unnecessary to remove microorganisms other than the particular microorganisms and proteins which are impurities, and it is also unnecessary to separate impurities and microorganisms other than the subject microorganisms incorporated in a specimen, and the particular microorganisms can be detected simultaneously and promptly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein a detecting-reagent containing section having a staining or coloring compound incorporated therein is provided in addition to a specimen contact portion, whereby microorganisms can be detected by adding a detecting reagent to the specimen contact portion without being deposited directly to a specimen, and the microorganisms can be detected safely, because an operator cannot touch the specimen contact portion and the detecting-reagent containing section directly, leading to an enhancement in microorganism detecting operability; and particular microorganisms can be detected simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein exciting light and fluorescent rays emitted by the exciting light and having a particular wavelength can be controlled by carrying out the staining by fluorescent rays, and cells to be detected can be discriminated easily and simply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein the numbers of living and dead cells or the number of dead cells can be counted at a single-cell level by using a compound suitable to be bonded to nucleic acid in the living and dead cells or the dead cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein the number of only living microorganisms can be counted by incorporating a compound for staining living cells by the reaction with a substance derived from the microorganisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein the judgment can be achieved with a good sensitiveness by ensuring that the substance derived from the microorganisms is an enzyme protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein the presence or absence of particular microorganisms can be judged with a higher sensitiveness by ensuring that the substance derived from the particular microorganisms is an enzyme protein, and further, the life or death of the microorganisms can be judged from the reactivity by the measurement with the passage of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein by separating compounds for developing colors by the reaction from one another, the color development provided by the compounds can be visually confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein it is possible to facilitate the storage of the compound by supporting the compounds on a carrier, and the detecting sensitiveness can be increased by increasing the area of contact with a specimen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein it is possible to facilitate the storage of the compound by supporting the compounds on a carrier, and the detecting sensitiveness can be increased by increasing the area of contact with a specimen, and wherein by separating the compound-supporting carriers developing the color by the reaction from one another, the color development provided by the compounds can be visually confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein the need for the scanning on a specimen contact means can be eliminated by setting the size of at least a specimen contact portion of the specimen contact means to be equal to the size of a light-receiving means of an optical microorganism counting apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein the reactivity of one or more compounds with microorganisms contained in a specimen can be increased by supporting the one or more compounds on a surface of a specimen contact portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein a reduction in activity of collected cells can be prevented by containing a culturing component in a specimen contact means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein a microorganism collecting effect can be enhanced by providing a specimen contact portion with a self-adherent property, whereby microorganisms deposited to a specimen can be counted precisely. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism detecting kit, wherein a special light-separating means is not required by providing the microorganism detecting kit with a light-separating function, and the confirmation of the color development can be simplified. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The microorganism detecting kit has a feature that the third compound is a compound capable of developing a color by the reaction with a substance derived from microorganisms. Thus, in the microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention, only living cells can be counted by a difference between amounts of colors developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The microorganism detecting kit has a feature that the substance derived from microorganisms is an enzyme protein.

Even when the staining is carried out at closer wavelengths, the visual judgment can be achieved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The microorganism detecting kit has a feature that the specimen contact means contains a culture medium for culturing microorganisms.

<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The microorganism detecting kit has a feature that the specimen contact means has a self-adherent property on its surface to be brought into contact with the specimen. Thus, in the microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention, the cells deposited to the specimen can be collected reliably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The microorganism detecting kit has a feature that the specimen contact means has a grip portion.

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The microorganism detecting kit has a feature that the detecting-reagent containing section has a function for transmitting only light having a particular wavelength. Thus, in the microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention, it is unnecessary to separate rays specially and hence, it is possible to simplify the confirmation of colors developed and to easily carry out the switching placement of a means for separating light having another wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The microorganism detecting kit has a feature that the specimen is a liquid specimen, and the specimen contact means is a preservation reservoir formed so that the liquid specimen stored in the preservation reservoir is of a given thickness. Thus, in the microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention, even when the specimen is the liquid, the specimen can be introduced into and stored in the preservation reservoir, and the thickness of the specimen can be maintained constant, whereby an error due to a difference in thickness can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above objects, the present invention provides a microorganism counting apparatus, comprising a specimen contact means in which any one or some of the following compounds are incorporated: a first compound for staining living and dead cells, a second compound for staining dead cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, a third compound for staining living cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, and at least one or more fourth compounds for staining particular microorganisms at a wavelength different from the above-described staining by the reaction with a substance derived from particular microorganisms; a light source for applying exciting light in a predetermined range of wavelength to a very small given area of the specimen contact means; a light-receiving means for receiving light emitted in a predetermined range of wavelength by virtue of the exciting light; a microorganism judging means adapted to receive the rays emitted by the application of the light from the light source within a preset given time for judging microorganisms, and to determine that microorganisms exist when the amount of light received is in a preset threshold value range; a moving means for moving the very small given area continuously or intermittently; and a means for adding the numbers of microorganisms from signals indicative of the judgment as microorganism from the microorganism Judging means. Thus, in the microorganism counting apparatus according to the present invention, it is possible to grasp the living or dead state of the microorganisms contained in the specimen contact means and/or the number or presence or absence of particular germs simultaneously and promptly, and to minimize the area and time of application of the exciting light, thereby inhibiting the extinction of the compound(s) contained in the specimen contact means by the exciting light. Further, the microorganisms and a foreign matter can be distinguished from each other by providing a threshold value for the intensity of the fluorescent ray, and the counting of the number of microorganisms contained in a given area can be carried out promptly and simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is possible to detect the microorganisms promptly and easily by incorporating the compound capable of grasping the living or dead state of the microorganisms into the specimen contact means, and it is also possible to avoid the deposition of the detecting-reagent containing section to the specimen by disposing the detecting-reagent containing section and the specimen contact means in a separated relation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In addition, microorganisms can be recovered efficiently from the specimen by providing a means for transferring microorganisms contained in an object on the surface of the specimen contact means, and the microorganism counting apparatus has a high sensitiveness. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> A microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention includes a specimen contact means having one or some of the following compounds incorporated therein: a first compound for staining living and dead cells, a second compound for staining dead cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, a third compound for staining living cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, and at least one or more fourth compounds for staining particular microorganisms at a wavelength different from the above-described staining by the reaction with a substance derived from particular microorganisms. The specimen contact means, for example, is comprised of a self-adhesive layer retaining a detecting reagent thereon and adapted to collect microorganisms from a specimen, a support for supporting the self-adhesive layer, and a grip which is in contact with the support to adjoin the latter. The microorganism detecting kit has such an effect that only living and dead cells can be stained by bonding of the compound for staining the living and dead cells to nucleic acid in the living and dead cells, and the presence or absence of the living and dead cells can be detected, or the numbers of the living and dead cells can be counted. The self-adhesive layer, for example, is one formed by mixing a solution resulting from mixing of peptone, sodium chloride or the like with an agar suspension, with 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride used as a compound for staining living and dead cells, and placing the solution containing the staining compound into a vessel after sterilization to solidify the solution. If the specimen is a wall surface, living and dead cells deposited to the wall surface are deposited to a surface of a culture medium containing the compound by bringing the surface of the self-adhesive layer into contact with the wall surface using the grip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Another microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention includes a specimen contact means containing the following compounds incorporated therein: one or more of a first compound for staining living and dead cells, a second compound for staining dead cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, and a third compound for staining living cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining; and at least one or more fourth compounds for staining particular microorganisms at a wavelength different from the above-described staining by the reaction with a substance derived from particular microorganisms. For example, when microorganisms are to be detected for food sanitation, it is a conventional practice that the number of common bacteria is counted, and the presence or absence of Coliform bacteria is confirmed. In such a case, the detection kit according to the present invention has such an effect that it is possible to simply carry out the counting of the common bacteria and the confirmation of the presence or absence of Coliform bacteria simultaneously and promptly, by counting microorganisms, i.e., living cells, which can be cultured on a culture medium, and by using a culture medium, in which a compound which can react with a substance derived from particular microorganisms which is Coliform bacteria, is mixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> A further microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention includes a detecting-reagent containing section and a specimen contact means, the detecting-reagent containing section containing one or some of the following compounds incorporated therein: a first compound for staining living and dead cells, a second compound for staining dead cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, a third compound for staining living cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, and at least one or more fourth compounds for staining particular microorganisms at a wavelength different from the above-described staining by the reaction with a substance derived from particular microorganisms. Thus, living and dead cells deposited can be stained, and the presence of the living and dead cells can be judged, or the numbers of the living and dead cells can be counted. Further, it is possible to prevent the detecting reagent from remaining on the surface of the specimen by carrying out this operation. The specimen contact means, for example, is comprised of a self-adhesive layer adapted to collect microorganisms from the specimen, a support for supporting the self-adhesive layer, and a grip which is in contact with the support to adjoin the latter. The detecting-reagent containing section is comprised of a film or a face-shaped layer containing the detecting reagent, and a support. The specimen contact means and the detecting-reagent containing section are connected to each other, for example, by a hinge, so that the self-adhesive layer of the specimen contact means and the film or the face-shaped layer of the detecting-reagent containing section are inner surfaces and in contact with each other. Alternatively, the specimen contact means and the detecting-reagent containing section may be formed in separated states. For example, the specimen contact portion is of a structure in which a generally commercially available normal agar culture medium (made by Nissui Seiyaku, Co.) is used as the self-adhesive layer and laminated by the support for supporting the self-adhesive layer, and a grip is attached to adjoin the support. The detecting-reagent containing section is comprised of the film having 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride retained thereon as the compound for staining the living and dead cells, and the support, so that a specimen is brought into contact with the surface of the self-adhesive layer of the specimen contact means using the grip, whereby cells deposited to the specimen are collected onto the surface of the self-adhesive layer. After the collection, the film retaining the compound in the detecting-reagent containing section is affixed to the cell-deposited surface of the self-adhesive layer, and the detecting reagent retained in the detecting-reagent containing section is moved onto the self-adhesive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> A further microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention includes a detecting-reagent containing section and a specimen contact means, the detecting-reagent containing section containing the following compounds incorporated therein: one or more of a first compound for staining living and dead cells, a second compound for staining dead cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, and a third compound for staining living cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining; and at least one or more fourth compounds for staining particular microorganisms at a wavelength different from the above-described staining by the reaction with a substance derived from particular microorganisms. Thus, living and dead cells deposited can be stained, and the presence of the living and dead cells can be judged, or the numbers of the living and dead cells can be counted. Further, the presence or absence of Coliform bacteria can be confirmed simultaneously. Namely, the number of common bacteria and the presence or absence of Coliform bacteria can be confirmed easily and promptly. Further, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that it is possible to prevent the detecting reagent from remaining on the surface of the specimen by this operation. When the number of common bacteria is to be counted and the presence or absence of Coliform bacteria is to be confirmed, the specimen contact means is formed using a culture medium comprising a commercially available normal agar culture medium, and the detecting-reagent containing section is formed using a film retaining 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride as the compound for staining the living and dead cells and a compound reactive with a substance derived from Coliform bacteria. Thus, the specimen is brought into contact with the surface of the normal agar culture medium, whereby cells deposited to the specimen are collected. After the collection, the film retaining the compounds thereon is affixed to the cell-deposited surface of the normal agar culture medium, and the detecting reagent retained is moved onto the surface of the normal agar culture medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism detecting kit, the staining or coloration is fluorescent. In this case, the color of the detecting reagent covering the surface of the culture medium and the fluorescent color developed are different from each other. Therefore, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that it is possible to prevent the interference of the staining wavelength, to easily recognize the microorganisms even visually, and further to count the microorganisms precisely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism detecting kit, the first compound is a compound capable of being bonded to nucleic acid. In this case, the dyeing of the nucleic acid exiting within cells is utilized as an indication and hence, after the dyeing, the cells can be detected to a one-cell level. Thus, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that the numbers of living and dead cells can be counted at a further high sensitiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism detecting kit, the second compound is a compound capable of being bonded to nucleic acid. In this case, the dyeing of the nucleic acid exiting within cells is utilized as an indication and hence, after the dyeing, the cells can be detected to a one-cell level. Thus, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that the numbers of dead cells can be counted at a further high sensitiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism detecting kit, the third compound is a compound suitable to stain microorganisms by reacting with a substance derived from microorganisms. In this case, the compound reacts with a metabolite derived from living cells, thereby providing an effect that the living or dead of the cells can be judged by the reactivity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism detecting kit, the size of the specimen contact portion is equal to that of a light-receiving means. In this case, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that a scanning course can be omitted by the fact that the size of the specimen contact portion is equal to that of the light-receiving means, and the microorganisms can be detected more promptly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism detecting kit, the specimen contact means having at least one or more of the first compound, second compound, third compound and fourth compound contained on its surface to be brought into contact with the specimen. Thus, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that it is possible to enhance the reactivity with microorganisms contained in the specimen by supporting compound(s) only on the specimen contact portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism detecting kit, the specimen contact means contains a culture medium for culturing microorganisms. Thus, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that it is possible to maintain the activity of cells, or increase the reduced activity of the cells to enhance the reactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism detecting kit, the specimen contact means has a self-adherent property on its surface to be brought into contact with the specimen. Thus, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that cells can be collected reliably by the fact that the specimen contact portion has the self-adherent property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism detecting kit, the specimen contact means is provided with a grip portion. Thus, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that microorganisms can be collected irrespective of the shape of the specimen and further, it is possible to prevent an operator from touching the specimen or the specimen contact portion after deposition of microorganisms to the specimen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The microorganism detecting kit itself has a function to transmit only light having a particular wavelength. Thus, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that a special light-separating means is not required and hence, it is possible to simplify the confirmation of a color developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The microorganism detecting kit includes the detecting-reagent containing section having a function to transmit only light having a particular wavelength. Thus, since the detecting-reagent containing section has the light-separating function, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that a special light-separating means is not required and hence, it is possible to simplify the confirmation of a color developed, and it is possible to easily conduct the switching placement of a means for separating light having another wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism detecting kit, the specimen is a liquid specimen, and the specimen contact means is a preservation reservoir for preserving the specimen, so that the liquid specimen stored in the preservation reservoir is of a given thickness. The microorganism detecting kit has a function to be able to preserve even the liquid specimen under constant conditions, whereby the detection can be simplified. Further, the microorganism detecting kit has an effect that it is possible to prevent the mis-recognition due to a variation in thickness by setting the thickness of the liquid specimen at the given value and hence to carry out the precise detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> A microorganism counting apparatus according to the present invention is intended to count microorganisms contained in a specimen, and includes a specimen contact means having such a shape that it can be easily brought into contact with a wall surface or a cookware such as a shape like a food stamp or a film shape, or having a structure provided with a grip. Any one or some of the following compounds are previously incorporated into the specimen contact means: a first compound for staining living and dead cells, a second compound for staining dead cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, a third compound for staining living cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, and at least one or more of fourth compounds for staining particular microorganisms at a wavelength different from the above-described staining by the reaction with a substance derived from particular microorganisms. The compound(s) incorporated into the specimen contact means can be changed depending on the purpose, whereby microorganisms to be detected can be changed. For example, when microorganisms to be detected are only living germs, only the third compound is incorporated, and when the sterilizing effect is to be verified, the second and third compounds are incorporated. Thus, the compounds can be selected as desired, depending on the purpose and the microorganisms to be detected. The specimen contact means, if it is of a culturing type usually used, is of a size on the order of 40 mm in diameter. However, if the size of germs contained in the specimen contact means are as very small as 1 to 5 &mgr;m, and a CCD camera conventionally used is employed to conduct the picture processing, the number of required pixels is enormous, and it is difficult to conduct the direct recognition. For this reason, such germs could be never detected without use of a magnifying means having a magnification of about 1000. Therefore, the present inventors have aimed at the size of germs contained in a surface of the specimen contact means in contact with a specimen, and have found that exciting light is applied in a predetermined range of wavelength to the area of 1 to 5 &mgr;m square (which is desired to be as large as possible, if it can be measured as a luminance of a light-receiving means, but which is desired to be equal to or smaller than the same size of 30 &mgr;m square as a photodiode), and the amount of rays emitted by virtue of the exciting light is measured, whereby the number of microorganisms is counted from a value resulting from the addition of the rays. In this case, the intensity of fluorescent ray emitted by application of the exciting light is changed with the time. Therefore, it is necessary to set a time within a given range of amount of rays emitted, and to judge the presence or absence of microorganisms from the amount of rays at that time. More specifically, impurities other than microorganisms emit no fluorescent ray, but emit scattered light of exciting light or the like, which provides an influence upon reception of light. For this reason, when the amount of rays received has reached equal to or larger than a given value, it is determined that there are microorganisms. Depending on the type of impurities, it can be assumed that the amount of fluorescent rays emitted from objects may be equal to or more than the amount of rays emitted from microorganisms. For this reason, if an amount of rays is in a preset range, it is determined that there are microorganisms, and basically, if an amount of rays in the range is received, it is determined that there is one microorganism. A very small area, to which the exciting light is applied, is moved continuously or intermittently, and for example, as compared with data in a conventional agar culture medium diffusion process, the entire area having a diameter of 40 mm is scanned, and the numbers of microorganisms in such areas are added, whereby the total number of microorganisms can be counted. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the underestimation due to the extinction of the compound(s) by the exciting light and to prevent the overestimation due to rays emitted from foreign matters. Thus, it is possible to confirm the life or death of microorganisms in a short time and to count the numbers of living and dead microorganisms in a short time without need for special technique and equipment, as compared with the conventional culture process and antibody process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> It is of course that a reagent as harmless as possible is selected as each of the first, second, third and fourth compounds. However, the microorganism counting apparatus is used mainly in food factories in many cases, and when what is to be detected is a cookware, it is not preferred for sanitation that a specimen contact means containing a reagent, even if it is harmless, is brought into contact with the cookware. In some cases, it is preferable depending on the characteristics of a reagent that the reagent is allowed to react with a specimen immediately before application of exciting light, and that each of the first, second, third and fourth compounds is carried on a film independently of the specimen contact means, or stored in a vessel and added to the specimen contact means immediately before application of exciting light. Based on this viewpoint, 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, which is one of reagents capable of being permeated non-specifically into living and dead cells through their membrane surfaces and bonded specifically to nucleic acid existing in cells, is retained in the detecting-reagent containing section, so that it is permeated from the detecting-reagent containing section into microorganisms collected on the specimen contact means. The life or death of microorganisms collected can be judged at the same time by doubly dyeing the microorganisms using propidium iodide, which is one of reagents capable of being permeated non-specifically in to dead cells through their membrane surfaces and bonded specifically to nucleic acid existing in cells, and applying exciting light having a specific wavelength to the microorganisms to stain or color the microorganisms. Alternatively, living microorganisms can be detected directly by applying exciting light having a specific wavelength to a compound capable of being permeated into cells and decomposed by esterase existing in living microorganism cells to stain the microorganisms, as is 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, thereby staining or coloring the living microorganisms. Additionally, it can be confirmed promptly whether microorganisms to be detected exist in microorganisms sampled from a specimen, by using a detecting-reagent containing section containing a compound reactive with a substance derived from particular microorganisms and a microorganism contact means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Microorganisms existing in a specimen are deposited efficiently to the specimen contact means by utilizing a transfer means. The transfer means includes those having a viscosity and liable to be adhered in a lattice configuration. It is possible to prevent the underestimation of microorganisms contained in a specimen by detecting the microorganisms using a specimen contact means having such a transfer means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Even when the specimen is liquid, the detection of microorganisms is made possible by utilizing a preservation reservoir for preserving the specimen. Examples of the preservation reservoirs are those defined by a thin layer formed at a site where a specimen is added, and the specimen is introduced to the preservation reservoir and spread, whereby microorganisms contained in the specimen are uniformized and detected. Alternatively, a fine groove may be defined previously in the preservation reservoir, and a liquid specimen may be poured into the fine groove, whereby the liquid specimen can be spread in the preservation reservoir. Further, by using a specimen contact means formed so that a liquid specimen stored in the preservation reservoir is of a given thickness, it is possible to maintain the distance from the light source or the light-receiving means to the specimen constant and to carry out the estimation with less error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> There is also an effect that microorganisms can be detected at a high sensitiveness and a very small specimen can be also detected, by the fact that the staining or coloration is fluorescent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> In addition, the compound for staining or coloring the living cells is a compound for staining or coloring the living cells by reacting with a substance derived from microorganisms, and an amount of such substance produced is detected, whereby the activity of microorganisms can be estimated. In this case, it is possible to grasp the number of the living cells by counting the stained microorganisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The compound for staining the living and dead cells or the dead cells is a compound capable of being bonded to nucleic acid. Thus, the nucleic acid retained in the cells can be detected and hence, the cells can be detected to a one-cell level, and the number of existing microorganisms can be counted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> In addition, by targeting the substance derived from particular microorganisms, the particular microorganisms can be detected. Further, by targeting an enzyme protein, the detection of the particular microorganisms can be achieved at a high sensitiveness, and the activity of the particular microorganisms can be also grasped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The light-receiving means is at least one photoelectric converting element, and a collector lens for collecting rays emitted by virtue of the exciting light is mounted in front of the photoelectric converting element. This provides the following effect: Fluorescent rays generated by the exciting light can be introduced in an increased range of the fluorescent rays into the photoelectric converting element and hence, a high detection sensitivity can be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> A plurality of photoelectric converting elements included in the light-receiving means are disposed in a linear arrangement. Thus, the movement of the photoelectric converting elements in a direction of an X-axis (a direction of arrangement of the photoelectric converting elements) is not required, and the detection of microorganisms in a given area can be carried out by moving the photoelectric converting elements only in a direction of a Y-axis (in a moving direction), and hence, the counting of microorganisms can be carried out promptly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The specimen contact means is of a disk shape and is movable. Thus, the detection of microorganisms can be achieved by rotating the specimen or the light source. For example, a photo-disk reading device may be used as a detecting means. The movement of the light source can be carried out at only the radius of the specimen contact means by placing and rotating the specimen contact means. Thus, the detection can be automated and increased in speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> The specimen contact means may be of a polygonal shape and is movable. Therefore, microorganisms contained on the specimen contact means can be detected easily. For example, a scanner may be used as a detecting means. Thus, the detection can be automated and increased in speed by placing and moving the specimen contact means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> A drive means for moving either one or some of the light source, the light-receiving means and the specimen contact means is mounted as a means for moving a very small area and is movable in a preset range of speed. Thus, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of the slippage of the color developed, the occurrence of the persistence of vision or the occurrence of the afterglow at the time of moving a very small area, and to prevent the overestimation or the underestimation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> A reflecting plate is mounted as a means for collecting light emitted from the light source and/or a means for collecting light to the light-receiving means. This provides an effect that it is possible to prevent a loss of extra light and to enhance the sensitiveness by collecting the light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> A light-separating section for transmitting light having a particular wavelength is mounted between the light source and the very small area. Thus, even when the wavelength of light emitted from the exciting light source is wide, the exciting light having the particular wavelength can be extracted. Further, by mounting the light-separating section for transmitting light having a particular wavelength between the very small area and the light-receiving means, it is possible to extract fluorescent ray shaving a particular wavelengths among the fluorescent rays having the various wavelengths, as does the exciting light, and the counting can be carried out at a high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> An auto-focusing means for adjusting the focus on the very small area within the specimen contact means is mounted on at least one of the light source and the light-receiving means. Thus, the stable counting can be achieved without dependence on the shape of the surface of the specimen contact means. Further, by the provision of the auto-focusing means, the area irradiated by the exciting light can be maintained constant, and the load applied to microorganisms collected by the specimen contact means and stained or colored can be minimized, thereby avoiding the underestimation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> A means is provided for introducing light emitted from the light source into the specimen contact means using an optical fiber. Thus, even if the specimen contact means is of a complicated shape, stable exciting light can be provided. Further, the light source can be mounted at another location by using the optical fiber. Thus, even when an exothermic light source is used, the load applied to the specimen contact means and microorganisms collected by the specimen contact means due to a generated heat can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> By using a lens adapted to transmit ultraviolet rays, an ultraviolet ray-generating means can be used as the light source, and hence, even exciting light in an ultraviolet range can be provided stably to the specimen contact means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> The apparatus or the specimen contact means may be provided with a means for indicating a measuring position, and the light-receiving means is provided with a means for recognizing the measuring position. Thus, it is possible to grasp a position in which at least one of the light source and the light-receiving means exists, to prevent the double detection of such position and the omission of detection and to avoid the overestimation or the underestimation. Further, the means for indicating the measuring position on the specimen contact means is magnetic, thereby providing an effect that the position can be recognized simply and precisely, and the overestimation or the underestimation can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> When the position on the locus for recognizing the measuring position on the specimen contact means is to be moved, it is moved to a next recognizing locus position with the distance kept constant from the original recognizing locus position. This makes it possible to prevent the omission of detection and to detect the entire specimen contact means. Further, the distance from the original recognizing locus position to the next recognizing locus position is in a range of 10 to 50 &mgr;m, thereby providing an effect that it is possible to enhance the correlation to the culture process, which is one of the conventional processes. This distance is a minimum distance capable of avoiding a range of recognizing colonies as one colony due to the duplication of the colonies, as is the case with the culture process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Microorganisms contained in the specimen contact means can be counted easily and promptly by recognizing each of signals provided from the microorganisms contained in the specimen contact means as a binary punctual coordinates, and counting the number of the punctual coordinates of the provided signals. Further, a luminance is determined from the binary punctual coordinates, whereby the activity of the microorganisms can be measured. Additionally, the correlation to the culture process can be enhanced by recognizing the adjacent signals as one signal. Yet further, the shape of deposits deposited to the specimen contact means can be grasped from the adjacent signals, and objects of shapes other than microorganisms can be eliminated from the counting, leading to an enhancement in accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> In a microorganism counting apparatus for counting microorganism utilizing the staining emission of light, received light is received by a light-receiving element, and the number of microorganisms is determined from an amount of light within a given time. Luminaries can be recognized by provision of a light-receiving means for receiving the colored and emitted rays. Further, by limiting the rays to an amount of light detected within the given time by the light-receiving element, it is possible to prevent the mis-recognition caused upon the extinction of microorganisms stained to emit the light and to recognize the precise colored and emitted rays, and to recognize the number of microorganisms precisely by adding and counting such rays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism counting apparatus for counting microorganisms utilizing colored and emitted rays, preset threshold values are provided for the intensity of the colored and emitted rays received by the light-receiving means, and when the intensity of the colored and emitted rays is fallen within the range of the threshold values, it is determined that there are microorganisms. Thus, too large or too small coloration due to foreign matters can be distinguished from the coloration of microorganisms, and the number of microorganisms can be recognized precisely by adding and counting the emitted rays within the threshold values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism counting apparatus for counting microorganisms utilizing colored and emitted rays, when rays emitted by microorganisms and recognized by a light-receiving element and rays entering a light-receiving element adjoining such light-receiving element are recognized as the presence of microorganisms, the microorganisms are judged all together as one group of microorganisms. Thus, it is possible to maintain the correlation to a case where when adjacent microorganisms form colonies with the growth thereof, the adjacent colonies are coalesced together and recognized as one colony in the plate counting process, which is one of the prior art processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> The apparatus includes a light source and a light-receiving means, so that cells are counted by a difference between wavelengths of rays emitted by a specimen and amounts of fluorescent colors developed. This apparatus has an effect that cells emitting fluorescent rays can be counted simply, and the estimating time can be shortened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> A microorganism counting process according to the present invention comprises the steps of bringing a first compound for staining living and dead cells and a second compound for staining dead cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining into contact with a specimen, and detecting the living cells and the dead cells simultaneously from a difference between the wavelengths and a difference between amounts of colors developed. Thus, the cells can be measured at a high sensitiveness even in environments where there are many types of microorganisms, and the estimation can be achieved even in actual service environments, without dependence on the enzyme activity indicated by the microorganisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Even when an enzyme is produced outside cells of microorganisms by the microorganisms, the microorganisms can be detected, while preventing the integration of the microorganisms with the background, because the compounds do not react the enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> In addition, unlike the detection using an antibody, the living and death of cells can be distinguished from each other at a high sensitiveness, because the compounds are bonded specifically to many types of cells. For example, by counting living and dead cells and dead cells simultaneously by bringing a reagent comprising of a mixture of 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride capable of being bonded to nucleic acid contained within living and dead cells with a propidium iodide capable of being bonded to nucleic acid contained within dead cells into contact with a specimen, and the number of the living cells can be measured from a difference between the number of the living and dead cells and the number of the dead cells. Further, the reagent reacts with individual cells quickly to achieve the staining or coloration and hence, the presence of the living and dead cells can be confirmed within a short time, as compared with the conventional culture process and the conventional antibody process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> The microorganism counting process comprises the steps of bringing one or more of a first compound for staining living and dead cells, a second compound for staining dead cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining, and a third compound for staining living cells at a wavelength different from the above-described staining; and at least one or more fourth compounds for staining particular microorganisms at a wavelength different from the above-described staining by the reaction with a substance derived from particular microorganisms, into contact with a specimen, and detecting both or one of the living cells and the dead cells and the particular microorganisms simultaneously from a difference between the wavelengths and amounts of colors developed. The living and dead cells, the dead cells, the living cells and the particular microorganisms can be detected simultaneously, whereby the counting of polluting microorganisms in medical and food sanitation fields and the monitoring of microorganisms in environments can be carried out promptly. For example, the number of common bacteria can be counted in food fields by the counting of the living and dead cells, the counting of the dead cells and the counting of the living cells and further, the states of foods after being sterilized can be grasped by measuring the dead cells. In addition, because Coliform bacteria discharge a specific enzyme protein called &bgr;-galactosidase, the presence of Coliform bacteria can be ascertained by using 4-methylumbelliferyl-&bgr;-D-galactoside, which reacts with the enzyme protein, and hence, the microorganism pollution can be examined in medical and food sanitation fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> The staining or coloration is fluorescent, thereby providing an effect that the interference of the wavelength of colored rays can be prevented, and the colored rays can be visually recognized simply. Further, the precise number of cells can be counted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> The first compound is one capable of being bonded to nucleic acid. Thus, living and dead cells can be counted to a one-cell level by bonding of the first compound to nucleic acid, and hence, the living and dead cells can be counted precisely at a high sensitiveness even in the presence of impurities such as metabolites from microorganisms, dusts and inorganic substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The second compound is one capable of being bonded to nucleic acid. Thus, dead cells can be counted to a one-cell level by bonding of the second compound to nucleic acid, and hence, the dead cells can be counted precisely at a high sensitiveness even in the presence of impurities such as metabolites from microorganisms, dusts and inorganic substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> The third compound is one for staining microorganisms by the reaction with a substance derived from microorganisms in the specimen, thereby providing an effect that the presence or absence of living microorganisms can be confirmed by the reaction of the third compound with a substance derived from microorganisms such as metabolites from microorganisms. In addition, the substance derived from microorganisms is an enzyme protein and thus, the presence or absence of living microorganisms can be judged at a higher sensitiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> The substance derived from particular microorganisms is an enzyme protein. In general, the enzyme protein is a substance resulting from the metabolism of living cells and hence, the living particular microorganisms can be counted without destruction of living cell membranes in a pretreatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> In the microorganism counting process, a compound for staining particular microorganisms by the reaction with a substance derived from particular microorganisms is brought into contact with a specimen, and particular microorganisms are detected from a wavelength and an amount of color developed. Thus, a detecting reagent can be supplied in a suitable amount to the specimen, and the particular microorganisms can be counted at a high safety and a high sensitiveness without direct or indirect touching of an operator with the specimen. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> After the cell or microorganisms deposited to the specimen are deposited to the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> including the agar culture medium, the compounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 contained in the agar culture medium react with the cell or microorganisms to become individually bonded to the cell or microorganisms to stain or color them. Living and dead cells, dead cells and living cells, which exist, can be confirmed by counting the colored cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> The 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride for staining or coloring the living and dead cells and the propidium iodide for staining or coloring the dead cells are passed through cell membranes and bonded to nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> The 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, after being bonded, absorbs exciting light at an exciting wavelength of 359 nm to emit light having a fluorescent wavelength of 461 nm to color the living and dead cells. The propidium iodide absorbs exciting light at an exciting wavelength of 535 nm to emit light having a fluorescent wavelength of 617 nm to color only the dead cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Further, the 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate is decomposed by esterase produced by cells to produce a fluorescein, thereby emitting fluorescent rays as a result of application of exciting light. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> In an actual use example, sterilized normal agar culture medium containing 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, propidium iodide, 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate and 4-methylumbelliferyl-&bgr;-D-galactoside, which are detecting reagents, was to be formed a self-adhesive layer, and the self-adhesive layer was brought into direct contact with a wall surface of a drain tank in an air conditioner by using the grip and placed onto a microscope adapted to emit exciting light. Then, exciting light was applied to the surface of the self-adhesive layer. Cells irradiated by the exciting light are colored or stained at individual wavelengths, and the number of individual cells emitting fluorescent rays was counted visually through a light-separating film for separating the fluorescent rays. Germs were collected from the specimen and measured in 2 to 3 minutes. For comparison, microorganisms on the wall surface of the drain tank are collected and cultured in a standard agar food stamp (made by Nissui, Co.) for detecting common bacteria and in a deoxycholate food stamp (made by Nissui, Co.) for detecting Coliform bacteria, and the number of detected cells was counted. However, the food stamps could not detect living and dead cells and dead cells and could not culture thermophiles and special bacteria and for this reason, the number of cells detected was smaller than that detected by the microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention. The number of living Coliform bacteria detected was equal to that of living Coliform bacteria detected by using the microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, amounts of rays emitted from the living and dead cells and the dead cells are counted from differences between wavelengths of colored fluorescent rays and between amounts of rays emitted, thereby counting the numbers of the living cells and the dead cells. Further, the presence or absence of Coliform bacteria and living cells can be confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> To count the deposited germs, they can be detected at 200 to 1,000 magnifications by a magnifying lens such as a microscope. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Even if a detecting kit is formed by using a reagent-containing sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in place of the reagent-containing vessel and using a specimen-retaining vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in place of the specimen contact vessel, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> similar effect is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In an actual use example, a detecting kit was used, which was formedusing a normal agar culture medium as a specimen contact means, and using a detecting-reagent containing section formed by a film retaining a solution containing 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, propidium iodide, 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate and 4-methylumbelliferyl-&bgr;-D-galactoside. The normal agar culture medium as the specimen contact means was brought into contact with a wall surface of a drain tank in an air conditioner and after the contact, the film containing the detecting reagents was brought into close contact with the surface of normal agar culture medium in contact with the wall surface. The specimen contact means and the detecting-reagent containing section left in contact with each other were placed onto a microscope capable of emitting exciting light, and exciting light was applied to them. Cells irradiated by the exciting light were stained or colored at individual wavelengths, and the number of individual cells emitting fluorescent rays was counted visually through alight-separating film for separating fluorescent rays. Germs were collected from the specimen and measured in 2 to 3 minutes. For comparison, microorganisms on the wall surface of the drain tank are collected and cultured in a standard agar food stamp (made by Nissui, Co.) for detecting common bacteria and in a deoxycholate food stamp (made by Nissui, Co.) for detecting Coliform bacteria, and the number of detected cells was counted. However, the food stamps could not detect living and dead cells and dead cells and could not culture thermophiles and special bacteria and for this reason, the number of cells detected was smaller than that detected by the microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention. The number of living Coliform bacteria detected was equal to that of living Coliform bacteria detected by using the microorganism detecting kit according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> With the above-described arrangement, the movement of the compound to the specimen due to the direct contact of the compound to the specimen can be prevented, and microorganisms existing in the specimen can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Example 3 of the present invention will be described below. An arrangement is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. A detecting kit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in Example 3 is comprised of a reagent-containing sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> retaining, on its surface, carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made by using activated carbon as a starting material and each providing with pores and each having 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride 2 supported thereon, a self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which is a specimen contact means, a support <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> retaining the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a grip <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for bringing a specimen into close contact with the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> With the above-described arrangement, the 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride 2 supported in the pores in the carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is protected from the oxidation due to a warm heat provided by the natural leaving, ultraviolet rays contained in natural light, or air, and the detecting kit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be preserved for a long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that by supporting, on a carrier having pores such as the carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having the pores, propidium iodide as the second compound for staining the dead cells at the wavelength different from the above-described staining, 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate as the third compound for staining the living cells at the wavelength different from the above-described staining, and 4-methylumbelliferyl-&bgr;-D-galactoside capable of measuring Coliform bacteria, as the fourth compound for stating the particular microorganisms at the wavelength different from the above-described staining by the reaction with the substance derived from particular microorganisms, the preservation of them can be facilitated, and the detecting sensitiveness can be enhanced by an increase in area of contact with the specimen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> In the example, the 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride was supported on the carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made by using activated carbon as the starting material and having the pores, but even if propidium iodide, 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate and 4-methylumbelliferyl-&bgr;-D-galactoside capable of measuring Coliform bacteria may be supported in the form of a mixture on activated carbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a similar effect can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> The carrier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a carrier having pores, but if the carrier is one having pores such as zeolite and silica gel, a similar effect can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Example 4 of the present invention will be described below. An arrangement is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> A detecting kit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in Example 4 is comprised of a reagent-retaining layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> retaining, in a separated manner on its surface, carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made by using activated carbon as a starting material and each providing with pores and each having 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride 2 supported thereon as a first compound for staining living and dead cells, and carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made by using activated carbon as a starting material and each providing with pores and each having 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate 4 supported thereon as a second compound for stating living cells, a self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a support <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> retaining the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a grip <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for bringing a specimen into close contact with the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, the fluorescent reagents are moved from the carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contained on the reagent-retaining layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to living and dead cells or dead cells, or to Coliform bacteria or living cells, which is deposited to the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the specimen, to dye or stain the various cells. In this case, the reagent-retaining layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is bisected, and the carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> retaining the reagents in the above combination are retained in the resulting separated sections of the reagent-retaining layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To carry out the detection, light having a wavelength peculiar to each of the fluorescent reagents is applied to each of the separated sections to stain intended cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is possible to detect the presence or absence of Coliform bacteria, the number of all germs, the number of living germs and the number of dead germs at one time and to grasp the state of the specimens in a short time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the carrier is not limited to the activated carbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> In addition, if even one type of the reagent is supported on the carrier, a useful effect can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Example 5 of the present invention will be described below. An arrangement is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> A detecting kit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in Example 5 is comprised of a self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> adapted to be brought into direct contact with a specimen to collect cells deposited to the specimen, a support <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for supporting the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a grip <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for enhancing the operability of the detecting kit, carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> containing a reagent colored by the presence of cells in pores, a reagent-containing sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for retaining the carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a light-separating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for separating applied exciting light into light having an intended wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, living and dead cells, dead cells and particular microorganisms deposited to the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are stained or dyed by the staining reagents supported in the carriers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and exciting light is applied through the light-separating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the stained cells and microorganisms. The exciting light stains the cells deposited to the self-adhesive layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through the light-separating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and hence, even if the exciting light is a light of a wider wavelength emitted from a light source, the cells can be detected and counted only by the detecting kit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> The light-separating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not only available to separate the exciting light but also available to separate fluorescent rays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> The light-separating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be comprised a film for separating the exciting light and a film for separating the fluorescent rays, which are superposed onto each other. In this case, the separation of the exciting light and the separation of the fluorescent rays produced by the exciting light can be carried out at one time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> The light-separating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be mounted on the support <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Example 6 of the present invention will be described below. An arrangement is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> A liquid specimen detecting kit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in Example 6 includes an introduction port <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for throwing a liquid specimen, and a discharge port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for discharging a surplus amount of liquid specimen and air previously contained in the liquid specimen detecting kit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The liquid specimen detecting kit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is of a structure in which a surface, on which at least a detecting section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> exists, is a light-transmittable surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that microorganisms can be detected in the detecting section. Further, a surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> opposed to the light-transmittable surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a structure in which it is in a parallel-positional relationship to the light-transmittable surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and it is not inclined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, even if the specimen is liquid, it can be retained in a given space. In addition, when microorganisms contained in the liquid specimen have been introduced into the liquid specimen detecting kit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the microorganisms can be diffused in a given region without being superposed one on another, because the distance between the light-transmittable surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> located in an opposed relation to the surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are maintained at a given thickness. Thus, it is possible to prevent the underestimation due to the superposition and to count the microorganisms precisely by a detecting means placed on the detecting section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the sensitiveness for detecting microorganisms can be enhanced by mounting a filter in front of the introduction port <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in order to remove foreign matters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In addition, the light-transmittable surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be formed so that it does not influence the exciting light such as ultraviolet rays, thereby preventing the obstruction of the exciting light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> The distance between the light-transmittable surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> located in an opposed relation to the surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in a range of 0.5 to 15 &mgr;m. Thus, it is possible to prevent the superposition of microorganisms and to achieve the precise discrimination. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> When exciting light is continuously applied to a fluorescent coloring matter, the intensity of fluorescent light emitted by the exciting light forms a curve of attenuation as shown in the curve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> due to the fading. A given time <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for maintaining the intensity including and around the maximum intensity of fluorescent light existing in the curve of attenuation is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, for the intensity of fluorescent light attenuated as shown in the curve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, even when counting after attenuation and not being counted, the given time <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for maintaining the intensity including and around the maximum intensity of fluorescent light is provided, and the addition and counting are carried out within such time, whereby the mis-recognition due to the fading of the fluorescent coloring matter can be prevented to enable the precise counting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The given time <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be set to be peculiar to the coloring matter, and may be changed depending on the type of the coloring matter. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> When microorganisms existing on a specimen contact means and stained or colored to emit rays have been detected, an intensity <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of fluorescent rays as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> can be obtained. A maximum threshold value 23 and a minimum threshold value 24 derived from the intensity of fluorescent rays of microorganisms are provided for the intensity <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and values of intensity <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of fluorescent rays existing between the maximum and minimum threshold values 23 and 24 are recognized as fluorescent rays derived from microorganisms and added all together to count the microorganisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, peaks having intensity values of fluorescent rays existing between the maximum and minimum threshold values 23 and 24 derived from the intensity of fluorescent rays of the microorganisms are recognized as microorganisms, and other values are determined as provided by foreign matters and are not counted, thereby enabling the precise counting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> The threshold values may be varied depending on the coloring matter, and a preset time suitable to the varied values may be provided. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Microorganisms existing on a specimen contact means and colored to emit light are shown in a CCD image <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. When they are recognized by a CCD element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, rays emitted from microorganisms are recognized within pixels. In this case, when a pixel with a germ B<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> recognized therein and a pixel with a germ C<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> recognized therein exist around a pixel with a germ A<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> recognized, the germ A<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the germ B<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the germ C<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are recognized as a germ group <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, as shown in an imaging diagram <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When a germ such as a germ D<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is recognized within one pixel, it is recognized as one germ E<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, as shown in the imaging diagram <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the germs in the pixels are counted in an adding manner. When the germs existing at locations on the CCD image <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> have been cultured, colonies A<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a colony B<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as shown in a culture medium <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, when a large number of germs exist, adjacent germs are recognized as one germ group <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and counted as one bright point in an adding manner. Thus, when the counting of the germs are carried out in the culture process which is one of the prior art processes is carried out, the correlation to the prior art process can be provided in consideration of the fact that the germ group is recognized as one colony. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> It is desired that a locus of exciting light on a specimen placed on a microorganism counting apparatus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, covers the entire specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, the exciting light is moved for detection as along a locus A<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to cover the width and the length of a specimen. The locus for detecting the entire specimen may be circular as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Therefore, the exciting light can be moved as along a locus B<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to detect microorganisms. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a model of a microorganism judging means in which a light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is moved along each of the loci on the specimen contact means, and using fluorescent rays produced by the exciting light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Fluorescent rays emitted from a specimen forms a microorganism Judging means <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> in correlation to sites emitting the fluorescent rays. Scattered rays produced from impurities or the like, fluorescent rays generated by the exciting light and the like coexist on the microorganism judging means <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and rays are not same as fluorescent rays emitted from target microorganisms in some cases. Therefore, threshold values are provided. The threshold values include an upper limit value <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and a lower limit value <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> for the intensity of fluorescent rays, and fluorescent rays within a range between the upper and lower limit values are recognized as derived from microorganisms and added all together. Thus, fluorescent rays derived from impurities other than microorganisms can be grasped to enable the precise counting of microorganisms. The threshold values are determined by the intensity of fluorescent rays emitted by microorganisms. When adjacent microorganisms exist, the waveform provided by fluorescent rays emitted from microorganisms is of a profile indicating the existence of the adjacent microorganisms as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. In this case, when the adjacent microorganisms have been detected in an agar culture medium diffusion process which is one of the prior art processes, colonies may be superposed one on another with the propagation of the microorganisms and the coalescence of colonies and determined as one colony at a time point of confirmation visually in some cases. Therefore, according to the present invention, in a case as shown in the waveform <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the adjacent microorganisms are detected as one microorganism. Thus, it is possible to provide the correlation to the agar culture medium diffusion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> The time of application of exciting light to the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is set in a range in which the intensity of fluorescent rays is not extinguished, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Namely, the time is in a range of threshold values <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the microorganism counting apparatus comprises a light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> as a light collector means, and a light-receiving section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. Exciting light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is separated by an exciting light separating filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to extract a target wavelength. The separated exciting light is diverted through a prism <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> into a path. The diverted exciting light is passed through the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and collected onto the surface of a specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Fluorescent rays emitted by microorganisms excited on such surface by the exciting light are transmitted again through the prism <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. In this case, the fluorescent rays are transmitted, as they are, through the prism <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> to reach the light-receiving section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The fluorescent rays reaching the light-receiving section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> are passed through a fluorescent ray separating filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to extract only a target fluorescent ray, and to reach a photoelectric converting element <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> included in the light-receiving section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, where they are converted into signals and recognized. Although not shown, the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> or the microorganism counting apparatus is provided with a means for moving the specimen contact means, so that all or some of fluorescent colors developed in the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> The fluorescent rays reaching the photoelectric converting element <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> are judged as derived from microorganisms or foreign matters in the microorganism judging means <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The fluorescent rays judged as derived from microorganisms are added all together, and the number of microorganisms is counted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> The exciting light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is collected by the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and the exciting light to be applied by the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is collected in a region of a very small given area. In this case, the term &ldquo;very small given areas&rdquo; indicates a region on the order of 0.2 to 7.0 &mgr;m per side, as determined based on the size of bacteria or true fungi. On the basis of comparison with the agar culture medium diffusion process which is one of microorganism detecting means utilized currently in most cases, colonies formed by the group of microorganisms cultured and propagated by the agar culture medium diffusion process may be superposed one on another if they are closer in distance to one another and finally, the superposed colonies may be recognized as one colony as confirmed visually in some cases. In this case, the term &ldquo;very small given area&rdquo; indicates a region on the order of 100 to 500 &mgr;m per side, when it is based on the distance between the non-superposed colonies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> The time of application of the exciting light collected by the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> depends on the time of extinction of the compound emitting fluorescent light and the intensity of the exciting light. Depending on the type of the compound, the compound may be decomposed even by ultraviolet rays existing in the natural world and hence, it is desirable that the exciting light is applied for a time in a range of about 2 second to about 300 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> When the luminance after the coloration is recognized, a position of fluorescent coloration is represented by a binary system comprising &ldquo;0&rdquo; and &ldquo;1&rdquo;, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. In the binary system, adjacent colors developed are regarded as one luminescent source <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. If the size and the luminance of the luminescent source are relatively largely different from preset values, such luminescent source is recognized as a foreign matter <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and regarded as out of the examination and is not counted as microorganism. As for a distance between adjacent colors developed, on the basis of comparison with the agar culture medium diffusion process which is one of microorganism detecting means utilized currently in most cases, colonies formed by the group of microorganisms cultured and propagated by the agar culture medium diffusion process may be superposed one on another if they are closer in distance to one another and finally, the superposed colonies may be recognized as one colony as confirmed visually in some cases. Thus, the term &ldquo;very small given area&rdquo; indicates a region on the order of 100 to 500 &mgr;m per side, when it is based on the distance between the non-superposed colonies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Microorganisms deposited on a specimen emit fluorescent rays by virtue of the coloring compound. Typical of the coloring compound are 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, which is one of reagents capable of being permeated non-specifically into microorganism cells irrespective of life or death of the microorganisms and bonded to nucleic acid in the microorganisms to color the microorganism cells, and propidium iodide which is one of reagents capable of being permeated non-specifically into dead cells and bonded to nucleic acid in the microorganisms to color the microorganism cells. Examples of other coloring reagents are 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, 2&prime;,7&prime;dichlorofluorescein diacetate, 6-(N-succinimidyloxycarbonyl)-3&prime;,6&prime;-0,0&prime;-diacetylfluorescei n, dihydrodorhodamine, fluorescein diacetate, 4-azidofluorescein diacetate and the like. The luminescence relies on the activity of an enzyme in the cells and is capable of dyeing living germs. Examples of reagents for dyeing particular microorganisms such as Coliform bacteria are 4-methylumbelliferyl-&bgr;-D-galactoside, 4-methylumbelliferyl-&bgr;-D-glucuronide and the like. These compounds react specifically with an enzyme produced by particular microorganisms to become decomposed into 4-methylumbelliferone. The 4-methylumbelliferone is excited by ultraviolet rays to emit fluorescent light. Thus, the number or the presence or absence of particular microorganisms can be detected by detecting the fluorescent light emitted by the excitation by the ultraviolet rays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a means for detecting microorganisms after being colored or dyed. The compounds have different maximum exciting wavelengths and emit fluorescent rays having different wavelengths, after being excited, thereby enabling the multiplex dyeing. In the detection of colors developed, if the light from the light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has a wider wavelength, the exciting light can be regulated in wavelength and separated by the exciting light separating filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The exciting light separating filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> can be exchanged depending on a target subject to be detected and hence, it is possible to accommodate various fluorescent reagents. At the same time, if the fluorescent colored light has a wider wavelength, it is possible to accommodate various fluorescent reagents by exchanging the fluorescent light separating filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> depending on a target subject to be detected in order to detect a target color developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Examples of the light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are various diodes, a halogen lamp, a xenon lamp, a cold cathode tube, a laser, a black light, a mercury lamp and the like. Among these light sources, any of the diode, the cold cathode tube and the black light with the maximum exciting wavelength limited relatively can be mounted without use of the exciting light separating filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the fluorescent light separating filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in some cases. When the halogen lamp, the mercury lamp or the like is used, the use of the exciting light separating filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the fluorescent light separating filter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be required in some cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> The prism <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> have a nature that they transmit ultraviolet rays, as required. Examples of materials having the ultraviolet ray-transmittable nature for forming the prism <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are a quartz glass and the like. Thus, it is possible to accommodate fluorescent reagents excited by ultraviolet rays. The specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> may be placed on a member which is rotatable. The exciting light collected by the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is moved from an outer peripheral portion to a center portion of the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, or from a center portion to an outer peripheral portion of the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through a distance corresponding to the radius of specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. In this case, it is possible to prevent the occurrences of the slippage, the persistence of vision and the afterglow of the fluorescent light emitted by the excited compound when the exciting light collected by the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> exists at the outer peripheral portion and when the exciting light collected by the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> exists at the center portion, by changing the rotating speed of the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> when the position of the exciting light collected by the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is at the outer peripheral portion and when the position of the exciting light collected by the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is at the center portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> A means is provided for recognizing the position in which the exciting light has been collected. Thus, the position of the exciting light collected by the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is recognized, so that the collection of the light is prevented from being deviated from the locus, and when the collection of the light has been deviated, it is returned again to the locus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> The coloring or staining reagents having the cell permeability have been exemplified, but any of coloring or staining reagents may be used which have a cell membrane depositability, a cell wall depositability, a sugar chain bondability, a functional group bondability, an amino acid adherability, an ion sensitivity, an oxygen reactivity, and even in this case, cells can be likewise detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> In addition, the coloring or staining reagents excited by the exciting light to emit the fluorescent light has been exemplified, but any of coloring or staining reagents having an ability of staining and coloring cells may be used and even in this case, cells can be likewise detected. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The compounds contained in the specimen contact means are capable of carrying out the multiplex dyeing, but they are not necessarily required to be mixed together. For example, a single specimen contact means maybe divided into portions corresponding to the number of dyeing compounds, so that cells can be detected in such portions, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> A diffraction grating may be utilized as a means for separating the exciting light or the fluorescent light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> The persistence of vision and the afterglow of the fluorescent light are prevented by adjusting the rotating speed of the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, but may be prevented by adjusting the moving speed of the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for applying the exciting light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> The means for recognizing the light collection position is not necessarily required to directly recognize the exciting light collection position, and may be a means capable of grasping the locus on the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Fluorescent rays excited and produced from dyed microorganisms existing in a specimen by the exiting light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are turned in direction by the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, collected by the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and detected by the light-receiving section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The fluorescent rays reaching the light-receiving section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> are judged as microorganisms or foreign matters in a microorganism judging means <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The fluorescent rays judged as the microorganisms are added all together, whereby the number of the microorganisms is counted. The light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> scans the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>.

In this case, the term &ldquo;very small given area&rdquo; indicates a region on the order of 0.2 to 7.0 &mgr;m per side, as determined based on the size of microorganisms such as bacteria. On the basis of comparison with the agar culture medium diffusion process which is one of microorganism detecting means utilized currently in most cases, colonies formed by the group of microorganisms cultured and propagated by the agar culture medium diffusion process may be superposed one on another if they are closer in distance to one another and finally, the superposed colonies may be recognized as one colony as confirmed visually in some cases.

Examples of materials having the ultraviolet ray-transmittable nature for forming the reflecting plate <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and the lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are a quartz glass and the like. Thus, it is possible to accommodate fluorescent reagents excited by ultraviolet rays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent any influence to the fluorescent light due to a reduction in intensity of the exciting light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> or due to external light, a dark-field view plate or the like for placing the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in a dark-field environment may be placed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> The light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is not necessarily movable. It is possible to detect the deposited microorganisms by moving the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> The light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is not necessarily built in the microorganism counting apparatus. A light source section including a light source <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be mounted outside the apparatus, so that exciting light can be introduced from the light source section into the apparatus utilizing an optical fiber or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> A means for removing lights of wavelengths other than a target wavelength may be provided depending on the type of the light source.

At this time, the pushing is carried out at a strength and for a time as much as the specimen contact portion <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is not crashed. Microorganisms deposited from the subject of examination are dyed by the addition of a compound for staining or dyeing microorganisms depending on the state or nature of the microorganisms or by the permeation of a compound previously contained in the specimen contact portion <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The detection of the specimen contact means <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> containing the dyed microorganisms is started.

Further, by the light-separating film <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> transmits light having particular wavelengths, the cells or microorganisms emitting fluorescent rays are lighted individually. The cells or microorganisms lighted at the particular wavelengths are counted, whereby the number of living and dead cells and the number of dead cells are counted and thus, the number of existing living cells is calculated. In this manner, the number of the living cells and the number of the dead cells in the specimen can be confirmed. </paragraph>
