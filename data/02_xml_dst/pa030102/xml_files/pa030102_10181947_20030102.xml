<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a modular construction system consisting of insertable modules which are embodied as hollow cubes and have open quadratic side surfaces. Adjacent modules in said modular construction are connected to an upper and lower section by means of insertable connector elements. Both sections have two parallel beams which are distanced from each other. The beams of different sections are arranged at right angles to each other and respectively define the perimeter of the insertable element. Both sections have a common peripheral raised edge which is used as a stop when the insertable element is inserted into the hollow cube. The invention also relates to special modules and special insertable elements. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention refers to a modular construction system according to the introductory part of claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A modular construction system with modules in the form of hollow cubes, to which further identical hollow cubes can be connected on all sides, is known. Therefore, in connecting the modules, insertable connector elements are provided which with their full surface, are inserted into the openings of a lateral wall of a cube, and which are connected with the opening of a lateral wall of an added, identical cube so that cubes can only be connected coaxially along the free axis of a coordinate system (however, not staggered relative to each other). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to increase the variability of such a modular construction system, and especially to position the individual cubes of a row in a staggered manner relative to the cubes of an adjacent row, e.g. similar to a multilayer brick compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, this object is solved by the characterising part of claim 1. Further embodiments are the subject of the subclaims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With the proposed modular construction system the individual modules are connected with each other by means of connector elements which are inserted into the openings of the lateral walls of the cubes in such a manner that modules with 0.5 or 1.5 times the width can also be connected with identical cubes of full width (1.0 times the width). The modules have a measure or unit of a relative to each other and to the insertable connector elements, thus, that a basic module has a width, length and height with the measure 6a if a is the width of the frame elements of a cube, which delineate the openings of each lateral wall, whereby the opening has a width of 4a. Accordingly, the insertable connector elements, which connect adjacent cubes with each other, are made exclusively to a width of 4a, their sides being square and symmetrical with an opening with the width of 2a. The insertable connector elements are constructed so that with a width of 4a units two beams arranged parallel to each other with a width a are staggered at a distance of 2a from each other, and that in the lower plane two lower beams are arranged at 90&deg; to upper beams and also with a width of a each and at a distance of 2a from each other so that the entire structure of the insertable connector elements comprises two beams at right angles to each other, which are arranged in different planes. These insertable connector elements consist of beams with square cross section having a width a and a distance 2a from each other (within the upper or the lower plane) so that within the distance between two beams the frame elements of two hollow cubes can be inserted which support each other, and so that the two cubes on the one side of the insertable connector elements are positioned staggered in view of the cubes arranged underneath or sidewards, and thus the cubes arranged one above the other are staggered by half the width of the cube (brick wall compound). Because the edge of the cube inserted parallel to the two beams of the insertable connector element, which cube has the width a of the edge compared to the distance 2a of the two beams, can be inserted resting on the left or on the right beam, an out-of-centre connection of the cube on the connector element can be obtained so that the inserted cube can be shifted by a distance a into the free space between the opposite beams, and thus different distances to the various beams can be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The edges of the openings of the walls of the cubes are provided with stops which allow the connector elements to be inserted into the openings only up to the centre of the height of these elements so that the one half resp. the one section of the connector elements is inserted into the opening of the wall of the cube, whereas the second half of the connector element is connected with the opening of the next cube to be added resp. the next two cubes. Each of the connector elements is provided with a projecting peripheral rim in the centre, which engages the stop of the opening of the wall of the cube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to obtain closed surfaces (e.g. for doors or windows) within the modular construction system, plate-type elements of the size of the openings of the lateral walls of the cubes are provided, the outer perimeter of which corresponds with the perimeter of the rim of the openings, and which are provided with edge elements which fit the stop elements of the edges of the openings of the cube in such a manner that the plates can be plugged or snapped into the peripheral edges of the openings so that plane surfaces of the outer sides of the cubes will be obtained. Said plates e.g. are provided with central recesses for removing the plates by means of pins or the like and for allowing pins to be inserted with other types of structural elements into said recesses, e.g. wheel axes. The plates inserted into said recesses e.g. can be facade-type blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the invention the connector elements can instead of being provided as central, square recesses, also be entirely closed and be provided with a central bore hole, which can accommodate an axle or through which an axle can be passed which is used for fitting a special module, e.g. an individual wheel or a wheel at each end of the axle. The central, circular recess can e.g. be formed as a bearing element for such an axle, and two connector elements on opposite sides of an axle can be provided and can be combined with each other by means of clips, snapping or locking elements. For example, modules formed as hollow modules are designed in such a manner that the cubes along a diagonal plane are divided into two halves so that roofs can be built therewith. The roofing can be formed in the shape of a pyramid, calotte or cap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the set of such a modular construction system can be provided with one or several flat base plates having connecting elements by means of which the modules can be inserted into the open sides. Furthermore, the invention proposes to use adaptor plates which allow the provision of an adaption from the raster measure of a hollow cube to a different raster measure of other modules of a different shape and size; in this manner the modular construction system can be extended so as to be used in connection with entirely different modular construction systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a different aspect of this invention, it is proposed, for universal use of the modular construction system to combine individual cubes into columns, corner connections or the like, e.g. to fasten them together by adhesive or to mold them in one piece in a molding process. Furthermore, it is proposed to combine a number of cubes into a base plate, within which the cubes are combined in rows and columns and are firmly connected with each other, e.g. by adhesive or by being molded. A special modular element according to the invention is formed in such a manner that it is combined from several rows and possibly several columns of individual cubes, which are combined to form a square or a larger cube, the interior of which is hollow and open at one side, and within which an electrical source in the form of batteries, accumulators and the like is accommodated. From this electrical source conductors are provided leading from the square, which are supply lines, e.g. for little bulbs for lighting purposes for elements of the modular construction system, for electrical motors for driving vehicles, cranes and other electrically driven machines or toyss, or for transmissions for driving such vehicles and the like which are made from modular cubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to a further embodiment of the invention, special play cubes are formed in such a manner that they are designed as a supporting plate, on the front side of which a face or a similar design element is plastically formed, or is designed as the picture of a face or the like, and that the rear side is provided with pins or similar extensions which can be inserted into the openings of cubes. Instead of such faces (or similar parts of the body or similar structures) support plates as play elements can be formed in such a manner that they form headgears, e.g. hats, helmets or the like, also with pins, extensions or the like on the rear side to be inserted into the recesses of cubes. Further special modules can be designed as adaptors for a transfer from four cubes forming a square onto an individual cube, or designed in the form of couplings for trailers, in the form of wheels or wheel rims, which by means of couplings can be inserted into the recesses of the tubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a another embodiment of this invention the modules according to the invention can be arranged within a container, e.g. a bucket with the shape of a cube with enlarged dimensions designed as an individual module, the length of the edge of which is several times the length of a module according to the invention, and which on its lateral walls and at the bottom is entirely closed so that the frame-type limitations of the lateral walls and the bottom surface is closed by lateral walls resp. a bottom wall, e.g. in the shape of internally staggered cassettes. Furthermore, a container formed in the shape of an enlarged module is provided with a lid which can be fitted or snapped onto the upper peripheral edge of the lateral walls of the cube, which can be provided with a handle for carrying the container, and which is positioned within corresponding recesses of the lateral frame portions in such a manner that it can be folded back in these support positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Instead of being an exact cube, the shape of the container resp. bucket can also be designed in such a manner that the lateral walls are slightly tapered from the top to the bottom so that a number of buckets can be arranged one within the other and can be stacked. Further embodiments of modules or modular elements are the subject matter of subclaims and are described in more detail together with the drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A cube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a modular construction set is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in a perspective view. Further cubes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, . . . with identical measurements to cube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and which are combined with cube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, are schematically shown. The cubes according to the modular construction system have lateral surfaces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which are designed as frames and form square openings <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> so that the cubes are hollow cubes with open sides. Such cubes are combined by means of insertable connector elements <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Each insertable connector element <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has an upper and a lower section <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The upper section <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comprises two beams <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with square cross-section which beams are arranged so that they are separate from each other, the lower section <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>comprises two beams <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, also of square cross-section; the beams <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as well <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are arranged at right angles to each other and one above the other so that they form the outer restriction edges of a connector element and in plan view form a central opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with square dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The dimensions of the cubes are chosen so that the entire cube length resp. width resp. height is 6a (a&equals;one unit), so that the frame portions have a width of a each and are at a distance of 4a each from each other. Accordingly, the connector elements <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> have a width resp. length of 4a units each, the beams <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> also have a length of 4a and a cross-section of a&times;a so that the distance between two parallel beams is 2a each. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> the cubes are connected with each other by means of said connector elements <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in a different manner so that a connector element can be inserted into an opening <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of a lateral wall of a cube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with one section <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the connector element <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, whereas the other section <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of cube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> extends from the cube wall, and a further cube <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with its opening wall is connected with the second section so that both cubes are connected with each other. The connector element is designed so that it can be connected to two cubes arranged next to each other, whereby the two adjacent edges of the two neighbouring cubes can be placed in the free space between two opposite beams, and so that one half of the connector element each is connected with each of the two cubes. The opposite section of the connector element can then be used to fit a further cube, the wall opening of which is connected by means of this section of the connector element so that the cubes arranged in different planes are staggered by half the width of a cube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a connection point between an insertable connector element <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and two cubes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected thereto. In the centre axis of the connector element <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is shown a symmetrical, triangular, peripheral projection <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of which are in contact with corresponding bevels <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the edges of the cube, which allows the cubes to be arranged close to each other without gaps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a wheel-type structural element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with an axle journal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> added thereto or inserted, which axle journal has a bearing-type extension <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which can be inserted into a connector element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> or a borehole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> so that the connector element can be used as a bearing for a wheel element. In this case the connector element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is not, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, provided with an inner opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, but with a closed plate receiving the bore hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> instead of said opening. </paragraph>
