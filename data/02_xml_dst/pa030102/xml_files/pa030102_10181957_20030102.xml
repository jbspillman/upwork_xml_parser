<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of judging entries for a contest, e.g., over a network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is common for a contest that all entries, for example, paintings, photos, illustrations, architectural plans, music scores, and other creations, are judged by the judges appointed by the sponsor to award prizes in the contest. Such a method of judgment is easily feasible only when the number of entries is small. However, if the number of entries is as large as over ten thousands, the judgment method will be conducted with much difficulty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As the Internet has widely been popularized, it may be used as an Internet network for entering a contest. In that case, the number of entries is enormously increased to, for example, hundreds thousands or more, as the contest is open to the Internet users of all the world. As a result, the above conventional judgment method will hardly be performed over the Internet. It is hence desired for every contest accessible over the Internet to handle and judge a large number of entries fairly and simply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of judging a large number of entries fairly and simply for any of contests. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A method of judging entries for a contest according to the present invention is provided comprising the steps of: registering each entry of a contestant; selecting a predetermined number of entries from the entries of the contestants and requesting another contestant to judge the predetermined number of the entries; registering the entry of the another contestant; and ranking the entries judged by the contestants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention allows the entries for the contest to be registered and then delivered to each contestant, e.g., as a group of five to seven entries which are judged by the contestant for determining rankings. On condition that the contestant is assigned to act as a judge, its entry for the contest is accepted and registered as a competitor for the prize. The entry of each contestant can be judged by any succeeding contestant who entries the contest after that. Since the entry of each contestant is judged by the other contestants, it can easily be ranked. Also, as the contestant is requested to judge the entries of the other contestants before its entry is accepted, its action for the entry and the judgment can be done at higher efficiency. Because the entries are ranked by the judgment of the contestants, their evaluation can be fair to some degree. Moreover, when some, namely 100 to 200, of the entries which have passed the primary judgment are assigned as the primarily awarded entries and subjected to the secondary judgment by specialists or professionals, their evaluation can much be fair and efficient. As the number of entries is increased, they can be judged at two, primary and secondary, or more steps to narrow down to a few awarded entries with a degree of the fairness. The contest judged by the method of the present invention may be intended for awarding music scores such as ringer melodies, paintings, photographs, cartoons, illustrations, writings, architectural plans, ideas, short stories, songs (word and music), playing performances, and other creations.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODES FOR EMBODYING THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A method of judging entries for a contest according to the present invention will be described in more detail referring to the accompanying drawings. The contest in this description is intended for awarding the ringing tone melodies of mobile telephones (referred to as ringer melodies hereinafter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> illustrate a judging system for judging entries of the ringer melodies for the contest. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the judging system includes a contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> linked to a known Internet network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is owned by a sponsor of the contest, for example, an advertising agent or a ringer melody provider. The contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is linked to personal computers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>N of clients (PC clients) who enroll as the contestants by the Internet network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for two-way communications and also to mobile telephones <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N of the clients (telephone clients) preferably. The mobile telephones <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N are arranged accessible to the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via a mobile telephone switching antenna network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a mobile telephone server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the Internet network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for two-way communications. The PC clients <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>N and the mobile telephones <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N serve as contest entering means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The Internet network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also linked with a payment server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a banking firm. In case the contest fee is necessary for entering the contest, the contestants have to submit contest applications with the contest fee through entering their relevant data including the ID number, the bank account number, and the total of fee from their personal computers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>N or mobile telephones <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N. The data is then transmitted via the Internet network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the payment server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which in turn carries out the following procedure. More specifically, the payment server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> asks the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the banking firm via the Internet network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the creditability of each contestant and when receiving a reply indicating that the contestant is eligible, directs a bank where the contestant has its account to pay the fee for the contest. The amount of money for the fee is then drawn from the account of the contestant and transferred to the sponsor of the contest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A procedure of entering the contest will be explained as followed by the method of judging the entries, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the procedure, the entry for the contest is conducted from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, although it can be made from the personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. It is essential that any entering means has a function of two-way communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The procedure starts with the contestant dispatching its created ringer melody along with the relevant entry data, e.g. in the form of an E mail, to the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for the contest. The E mail including the created ringer melody is transmitted from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the contestant via the mobile telephone switching antenna network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the mobile telephone server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the Internet network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) illustrates a display on the screen of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for dispatching the entry including the title of the created ringer melody and, if desired, the name, birth, and occupation of the contestant. The entry is accompanied with the created ringer melody data. Moreover, when the entry fee is needed, the account number for payment shall be added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving the entry of the E mail from the contestant, the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> temporarily registers and saves its contestant data and the created ringer melody in a memory means <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> provided therein. After the temporary registration, the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> picks up a predetermined number (preferably 2 to 10, five in this embodiment) of the other ringer melodies from the memory means <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which have officially been registered and delivers them to the contestant. As a result, the ringer melodies of the other contestants are partially displayed on the screen of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the contestant. The number of the other ringer melodies to be delivered from the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for judgment by each contestant is determined by a judgment number setting means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) illustrates an example of the five ringer melodies displayed on the screen of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the contestant after received from the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this example, the title and the number of each ringer melody to be judged are displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In addition to the judgment number setting means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a number comparing means <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for selectively determining the number of the other ringer melodies to be received and displayed on the mobile telephones <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the contestants depending on the total number of the entries. The action of the means involves calculating the total number of entries and, when the total number exceeds a given level, determining how many preliminary contests have to carried out and how many entries have to be received by the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of each contestant in consideration of, e.g., the total number of the entries and the time of decision for awarding the entries. When the total number of the entries is not greater than the given level, the contest will be started directly with the final stage without having preliminary stages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The judgment number setting means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can increase or decrease the number of the other ringer melodies to be delivered to each entry means, for example mobile telephone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. For example, when some pieces of information are given including the total number of entries and the total duration required before the final decision is made, they may be used for an automatic reverse action of determining the number of ringer melodies to be delivered to each entry means. This allows the judgment number setting means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to set the number of ringer melodies to be judged to a range from 2 to 10. It is generally supposed that if the number of ringer melodies to be judged is greater than 10, the result of the judgment will hardly be adequate. Yet, the number of ringer melodies to be judged by each contestant can be set to greater than 10 if desired. The number comparing means <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may preferably be designed for detecting discrepancies between the judgments and examining whether or not the judgment has to be repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving the predetermined number, e.g. five, of the ringer melodies of the other contestants, the contestant examines and judges them with scores which are then received by the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The judgment may be made by each contestant assigned with one vote and giving its vote to the most favorable ringer melody. For example, the display shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) illustrates the entry two is awarded with one vote. Alternatively, the most favorable ringer melody may be awarded with three points while the second favorable ringer melody is awarded with one point. Moreover, the judgment may be made by ranking all the five ringer melodies from the first awarded with five points to the fifth awarded with one point. This type of the judgment method may also be modified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the predetermined number (namely five) of the ringer melodies to be judged are not officially registered by the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> before the first to fifth entries are received. As the above described judgment is hence unfeasible, the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can without any condition officially register five of the initial entries with their contestant data and melody data. Each of the sixth and more entries are then requested by the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, where five or more of the other ringer melodies have been received and registered, for judging any set of the (namely five) other ringer melodies. The set of the other ringer melodies to be judged may be selected on the first come first served basis. More specifically, the sixth contestant receives the ringer melodies of the first to fifth entries, the seventh (the eighth, the ninth, . . . ) contestant receives the ringer melodies of the second (the third, the fourth, . . . ) to sixth (the seventh, the eighth, . . . ) entries, and so on. The created ringer melody of each entry can thus be judged by the other contestants and its most favorable one is awarded with five points of the maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> However, as apparent from the description, the method fails to permit the initial five contestants to judge the other entries and the final five entries, of which the contestants are allowed to judge the other entries, to be fairly judged by the other contestants. For elimination of the above drawback, a modification of the method is proposed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The modification is explained in more detail referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. When it is confirmed that the number of entries is twelve, the sixth contestant is assigned to judge the ringer melodies of the first to fifth entries and the seventh contestant is assigned to judge the ringer melodies of the second to sixth entries. Similarly, the last, twelfth contestant is assigned to judge the ringer melodies of the seventh to eleventh entries. Also, while the first contestant is assigned to judge the ringer melodies of the eighth to twelfth entries, the second contestant is assigned to judge the ringer melodies of the ninth to twelfth entries and the first entry and the third contestant is assigned to judge the ringer melodies of the tenth to twelfth entries and the first and second entries. Similarly, the fifth contestant is assigned to judge the ringer melodies of the twelfth entry and the first to fourth entries. In this manner, each contestant is assigned to judge the ringer melodies of any five other contestants. When the number of entries is increased to 10,000 or 100,000, the same manner can be used for the judgment. In any case, the first to fifth contestants receive the ringer melodies of the other entries to be judged only when the total number of the entries has been confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The result of each judgment is then transferred to the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a judgment determining means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The judgment determining means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> receives, saves, and sums the points of the judgment from the contestants to determine the rank. The entry for the contest is officially accepted on the condition that its contestant judges the ringer melodies of other contestants and delivers the result of the judgment to the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In turn, the contestant data and its ringer melody data which have temporarily been registered are formally registered and the ringer melody is treated as an entry to be judged in the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The contestant then receives a notice of entry acceptance from the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which indicates that its entry is officially accepted as is displayed in the screen of its mobile telephone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). For example, the entry number assigned to the ringer melody created by the contestant is displayed. When the entry fee is required upon the formal registration, the contestant starts a procedure for paying the entry fee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Since the judgment of the ringer melodies of the other contestants is mandatory to each contestant who wants to enter the contest, the ringer melody of each entry is judged by the other contestants. Accordingly, the entry for the contest can significantly be encouraged and, even if the number of entries is increased, the ringer melody of each contestant can be judged easily, readily, and, to some degree, fairly. This may be explained by most of the contestants having degrees of knowledge of the ringer music and participating as those who skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The judgment of the ringer melody of each entry is carried out by the above manner. At the final stage of the judgment, the ringer melodies of all the contestants are ranked by the points. The ringer melodies are ranked by their points, for example, five points for the highest and ranked down, to determine the first prize, the second prize, and so on. Alternatively, at the final stage, the ringer melodies awarded with, for example, five points (and also four points) may be grouped as a top rank (for example, ten entries being selectively grouped) and then judged by professionals of the ringer music. This allows a large number of the entries to be judged efficiently and fairly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The method of this embodiment involves a single process of the judgment. However, when the number of entries for the contest is too large, their ringer melodies may be subjected to a first-stage judgment. Then, the ringer melodies passed on the first-stage judgment may be judged at the second-stage. Alternatively, the ringer melodies passed on the second-stage judgment may be subjected to a third-stage judgment. The second-stage judgment following the first-stage judgment can be conducted by the following manner. At the first-stage judgment, a given number of the ringer melodies of the other entries are judged by each contestant who is formally registered as an entry for the contest on the condition that it judges the ringer melodies of the other contestants. As the ringer melodies are ranked by the first-stage criteria, their higher entries are passed as the first-stage judgment passed ringer melodies. After the first-stage judgment, the contestants of the passed ringer melodies are informed via the Internet network <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the antenna network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that their entries are passed on the first-stage judgment and moved to the second-stage judgment. As a similar procedure as of the first-stage judgment is carried out for the second-stage judgment, a given number of the first-stage judgment passed ringer melodies are judged by each contestant who is formally registered as a first-stage judgment passed entry for the contest on the condition that it judges the ringer melodies of the other first-stage judgment passed contestants. As the ringer melodies are ranked by the second-stage criteria, their highest entry or the final stage entries are determined. In this manner, a large number of the entries can be judged efficiently and fairly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> For example, when the number of entries is 100,000, the ringer melodies passed on the first-stage judgment (e.g. 2,000 entries) have to be subjected to the second stage judgment to narrow down the entries judged at the final stage. In the same manner as mentioned above, each five of the 2,000 ringer melodies passed on the first-stage judgment are then secondarily judged by each contestant of which the ringer melody has passed the first-stage judgment. At the second-stage judgment, the contestants of which the ringer melodies fail to pass the first-stage judgment are not allowed to participate the judgment. By repeating this procedure, the third, fourth, or higher stage judgments are conducted to fairly determine a group of the final entries (e.g. ten ringer melodies) which are then judged by professionals of the ringer music at the final stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> For conducting the second, third, fourth, or higher stage judgments, the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of this embodiment further includes a selecting means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for automatically notifying the selected or passed contestants of the entry into a further stage judgment after the registration in the judgment determining means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When the number of the finally passed ringer melodies determined by the judgment determining means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is greater than the number of the final stage entries (e.g. ten), the selecting means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> selects and contacts the contestants for participating the second, third, or higher stage judgment. Results of the second-stage judgment are then received and summed by the judgment determining means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for determining the second-stage judgment passed entries. Similarly, results of the third-stage judgment are then received and summed by the judgment determining means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for determining the third-stage judgment passed entries. The selecting means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a further function for notifying awarded ones of the contestants of the entry into the final stage judgment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention allows each contestant to enter the contest through accessing the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from its entering means such as the personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Upon identifying and directing the contestant for carrying out a pre-entering procedure through the payment server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the banking computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> drives its judgment number determining means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to determine the number of ringer melodies to be delivered to each entry means or mobile telephone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from a variety of factors including the total number of entries and the duration required for determining the final winner. This setting of the number maybe conducted manually or automatically depending on those factors. In turn, the contestant judges a group of the ringer melodies of the other contestants and supplies the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with its judgment points. The judgment points are saved in the memory means <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The judgment determining means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> then analyzes the judgment points of each contestant to determine the awarded ringer melodies. Then, the contestants of which the ringer melodies are awarded are identified by the selecting means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the contest server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and, if desired, they are further subjected to a higher-stage judgment.
