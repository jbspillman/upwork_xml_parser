A quartz specimen is immersed in hydrofluoric acid to expose a layer to be analyzed located at a prescribed depth. On an exposed surface, a decomposition liquid such as hydrofluoric acid or nitric acid is dripped to decompose only an extremely thin layer to be analyzed, followed by recovering of the decomposition liquid. The decomposition liquid is quantitatively analyzed by use of atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or the like to measure an amount of metal contained in the decomposition liquid. From a difference of thicknesses before and after the decomposition and an area of dripped decomposition liquid, a volume of a decomposed layer to be analyzed is obtained. From this and the amount of metal contained in the decomposition liquid, a concentration of metal contained in the layer to be analyzed, in addition a diffusion coefficient of a layer to be analyzed is calculated. With thus obtained diffusion coefficient as an index, quartz material in which metal diffuses with difficulty is sorted out.

In the thermal treatment equipment, an almost cylindrical quartz tube, that is, a quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, is disposed. The semiconductor wafers <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> are accommodated in the quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> together with a wafer boat <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> holding the wafers <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> approximately level, in an almost vacuum state. The wafers <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> are heat-treated by heat from a heater <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is arranged so as to surround the quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the drawing, a furnace cover <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is a cover for carrying the semiconductor wafers <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> together with the wafer boat <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in and out of the quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. A rotary table <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> rotates during heat treatment to improve uniformity of heat treatment of the semiconductor wafers <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> of the wafer boat <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, reflector plates <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and a furnace liner tube <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> are disposed to make more uniform a temperature distribution in the thermal treatment equipment, an heat insulator <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> being disposed to cover an approximate entirety of the thermal treatment equipment to maintain heat therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The heater <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes metal atoms such as copper or the like, upon heating, the metal atoms diffusing from the heater <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to deposit on a surface of the quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The metal atoms deposited on the surface of the quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> diffuse in the quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in a thickness (depth) direction to reach the inside of the quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Therefrom, the metal atoms intrude into a space inside of the quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and deposit on the semiconductor wafers <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> being heat treated to cause so-called contamination, thereby resulting in an occurrence of poor quality products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Physical properties and compositions of the quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are considered to have some relationship with diffusion and contamination of the metal. Accordingly, the physical properties and compositions of quartz material constituting the quartz glass furnace tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are necessary to be controlled. In particular, a diffusion coefficient when the metal atoms diffuse through the quartz glass is an indicator in grasping a diffusion speed of a contaminant. Accordingly, accurate knowledge of the diffusion coefficient is important. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, data, which are supplied from manufacturers of the quartz glass furnace tubes, of the diffusion coefficient of quartz materials configuring the quartz glass furnace tubes scatter largely dependent on manufacturers thereof. Between the manufacturers compared, there is a difference in data of as much as approximately 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>times at maximum. Accordingly, there is a problem in impartially judging quality of the quartz glass furnace tube that is a product in terms of the data of the diffusion coefficients supplied from the manufacturers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in existing methods, the diffusion coefficients of the quartz glass furnace tubes are measured by means of SIMS method (Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy method) or an optical method. However, in the SIMS method, a detection lower limit is extremely coarse as 4.8 &mgr;g/g, an analysis area (depth) being small as approximately 200 &mgr;m. Accordingly, there are problems that measurement capacity is poor, measurement accuracy being low, investment being large, cost for one measurement being high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the optical method, a depth resolution is too thick as 500 &mgr;m, the detection lower limit being approximately 10 ng/g. As a result, both the measurement capacity and measurement accuracy can not be sufficiently satisfied. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a flow of an analysis method involving one embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> being a diagram schematically showing circumstances in implementing the above method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In implementing an analysis method involving the present invention, first a specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of for instance rectangle or square is prepared. The specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is immersed in a surface treatment liquid, hydrofluoric acid (HF) for instance, to etch a surface thereof <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The etched surface is a surface of a layer to be analyzed. For instance a surface of a layer of a depth of 10 &mgr;m from the surface of the specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is exposed (step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). At that time, a thickness of a layer to be etched can be controlled by appropriately adjusting the conditions such as a concentration of the treatment liquid such as hydrofluoric acid, an etching period during and a temperature at which the etching is implemented. Furthermore, hydrofluoric acid may be used in any one of liquid and gaseous (vapor) forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Next, the specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is taken out of hydrofluoric acid, followed by cleaning and drying, thereafter a thickness of the specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is measured (step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). In measuring the thickness, various kinds of known measuring methods that use a micrometer or electromagnetic waves may be used. Thus obtained thickness is recorded as for instance dn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Next, on a single surface of the specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, as a decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> a mixed liquid of for instance hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid is dripped (step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). At that time, the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be hydrofluoric acid alone, or a mixed liquid of hydrofluoric acid and other acid, for instance one or more of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, or a mixed liquid of hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen peroxide, or a mixed liquid of hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen peroxide and other acid, for instance one or more of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> From a viewpoint of easiness to dissolve metal atoms in quartz into the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a mixed liquid of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid is preferably used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A composition and concentration of the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a mixing ratio in the mixed liquid are preferably adjusted to values appropriate for decomposing a surface of quartz of the specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by 10 &mgr;m per approximate 30 min for instance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> After dripping the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, while maintaining at an appropriate temperature as it is, a surface of the quartz specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is decomposed by a very thin layer, for instance a layer of a thickness of approximately 10 &mgr;m (step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> At that time, the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, owing to its <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> own surface tension, is held on the specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to enable to dispense with a cap or container. Accordingly, during the decomposition, a substance attached to a container does not contaminate the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, or an amount thereof does not vary as the result of sticking to the cap. Here, an area S in which the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> spreads out is measured, or in the range of a known area S the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is spread out and held. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Though the period and conditions when holding the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are design matter, it is preferable to adjust so that a surface of quartz of a thickness of approximately 10 &mgr;m is decomposed in for instance 30 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Next, after the prescribed period passed to completely decompose, the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is recovered (step <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Thus obtained decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is subjected to a quantitative analysis equipment, metal contained in the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, for instance an amount of copper being analyzed (step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). For the quantitative analysis equipment used at that time, though whatever apparatuses can be used, typically, for instance an atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or an ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy), and an ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy) may be employed. Thus obtained amount of metal is recorded as for instance Cn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Next, a thickness of the quartz specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of which surface was decomposed in the aforementioned step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is measured by the use of the method similar with that in the step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). Thus obtained thickness of the specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is recorded as d<highlight><subscript>n&plus;1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Next, a concentration of metal in the layer to be analyzed is obtained from data obtained as mentioned above. That is, from the thicknesses dn and d<highlight><subscript>n&plus;1 </subscript></highlight>of the specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> obtained in the steps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a thickness of the layer to be analyzed is obtained. Thus obtained thickness is multiplied by the area S obtained in the step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to result in a volume Vn of the layer to be analyzed. In the volume Vn, the metal of the amount Cn obtained in the step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is contained. Accordingly, a concentration of metal contained in the layer to be analyzed can be obtained from Cn/Vn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Given the concentrations of metal, a diffusion coefficient D of the layer to be analyzed can be obtained from Fick&apos;s second law &part;C/&part;t&equals;D&middot;&part;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>C/&part;X<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, as ln C&equals;&minus;X<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/4Dt&plus;A. (In the equations, C: a concentration of metal at a depth X (atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>), D: a diffusion coefficient (cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s), X: depth (cm), t: diffusion time period (sec), A: constant). By solving the above equation, the diffusion coefficient D can be obtained (step <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>). The obtained diffusion coefficient is recorded as Dn (step <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Following this, whether a further inside layer is necessary to analyze quantitatively as a layer to be analyzed or not is judged (step <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). When the further quantitative analysis being judged necessary, returning to the step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, with hydrofluoric acid, for the further inside layer too, similarly the steps from <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are repeated to obtain a diffusion coefficient D<highlight><subscript>n&plus;1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> After that, the steps <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are similarly repeated to analyze thin layers to be analyzed of a thickness of approximately 10 &mgr;m consecutively from outside to inside of the quartz specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the respective diffusion coefficients D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, - - - , D<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>n&plus;1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>n&plus;2</subscript></highlight>, - - - D<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>being obtained and recorded. Upon completion of the quantitative analysis of the innermost side of the layer to be analyzed, all the analysis operations are over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As explained in the above, according to the analysis method involving the present embodiment, with hydrofluoric acid a surface of a layer to be analyzed at a desired depth is exposed, and thereafter an amount of metal in the layer to be analyzed is analyzed. Accordingly, a metal content at an arbitrary depth of the quartz specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, in its turn a diffusion coefficient in the arbitrary layer, can be analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, with the decomposition liquid a layer to be analyzed is decomposed to analyze. Accordingly, a very thin layer can be analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Still furthermore, a decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is held on a specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by its own <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> surface tension. Accordingly, during decomposition, a contaminant is very low in intruding into the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is analyzed in liquid with decomposition liquid. Accordingly, a shape of the specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is large in degree of freedom. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the following, an example of the first embodiment of the present invention will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As a specimen for analysis experiment, a quartz specimen for analysis of depth&times;width&times;thickness&equals;20 mm&times;20 mm&times;4 mm was prepared. To investigate a state where copper atoms diffused in the quartz specimen, on a single surface of the specimen a solution of ionized copper of a concentration of 10 &mgr;g/g was coated. While maintaining a temperature of 1050&deg; C. under an atmospheric pressure, in this state, the specimen was heated for 24 hours to diffuse copper atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Next, the specimen, after cleaning the surface thereof, was immersed in hydrofluoric acid. Thereby, the outermost layer of a thickness of approximately 10 &mgr;m was etched to expose a surface of a layer necessary to analyze. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Next, after obtaining a thickness d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the specimen, a mixed liquid of 25% hydrofluoric acid and 0.1 N nitric acid was prepared as a decomposition liquid, followed by dripping on the specimen. In this state, the decomposition liquid was held on a surface of the specimen by its own surface tension to decompose a layer to be analyzed. After the decomposition of approximately 30-min, the decomposition liquid was recovered. Thus, the decomposition liquid thought to contain copper was obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The decomposition liquid thus recovered was subjected to atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), copper contained in the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> being quantitatively analyzed to obtain a copper content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a thickness of the specimen after the decomposition by the decomposition liquid was measured to obtain a value of thickness d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The thickness d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> obtained by the later measurement was subtracted from the thickness d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> previously obtained to obtain a thickness of a layer to be analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Thereby, the diffusion coefficient of the decomposed layer was made calculable. In addition, due to the later further experiments, it was confirmed that a depth resolution when analyzed due to the present analysis method is approximately 10 &mgr;m, a lower detection limit of the metal contained in the quartz specimen being 2.8 ng/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> (Reproducibility Verification Experiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> An experiment for verifying reproducibility involving the present invention was carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> By the method similar with that of the above embodiment, two pieces of specimens ware prepared, being coated by a copper solution to prepare two forcedly contaminated specimens. With these specimens, operations similar with that of the aforementioned embodiment ware conducted to investigate a state of diffusion of copper (copper concentration). Results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. An abscissa shows a distance (depth) from a surface of a quartz specimen, an ordinate showing a contained copper concentration. As obvious from the diagram, data of two specimens are very close, showing having high reproducibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> (Cross Contamination Verification Experiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Next, a cross contamination verification experiment of the present analysis method was carried out. This will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>. For the present experiment, a specimen prepared in the similar way with the aforementioned embodiment (forcedly contaminated specimen <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>) and a specimen that is not coated by the copper solution, the quartz specimen as it is (bulk material <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) ware prepared. These two specimens <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> ware accommodated in the same treatment space <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, with the treatment space <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> under an atmosphere of 50% hydrofluoric acid, being maintained in this state for a definite period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The copper concentrations of the respective layers to be analyzed of the forcedly contaminated specimen <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and bulk material <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> ware analyzed to investigate an influence on the bulk material <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Here, the copper concentrations of the respective analysis layers ware analyzed for the respective analysis layers similarly with the aforementioned embodiment, being obtained as the copper concentrations of the respective decomposition liquids. The results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the bulk material <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is hardly contaminated by copper to show no influence. That is, it is shown that the copper dissolved in the decomposition liquid does not diffuse again into the specimen, amounts of copper analyzed of the respective layers to be analyzed reflecting extremely accurately a state of copper diffusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned analysis method involving the present invention is compared with an existing one in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the present invention is confirmed to be superior in the lower detection limit, resolvable region (depth), cross contamination and reproducibility, to the existing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As a result, according to the present invention, the diffusion coefficient of high reliability can be obtained by the use of the analysis method of high accuracy. Accordingly, with the diffusion coefficient, quality of the quartz material can be differentiated, thus enabling to obtain a quartz tube through which copper diffuses with difficulty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> That is, the surface of the quartz specimen is divided into thin layers to be analyzed, the layers to be analyzed each being chemically analyzed. Accordingly, an analysis result of high accuracy can be obtained, resulting in a diffusion coefficient of high reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the same specimen is separated, from the outside thereof toward the inside, into many adjacent layers, the adjacent layers each being chemically analyzed. Accordingly, the circumstances where metal atoms diffuse can be verified in detail, resulting in obtaining the diffusion coefficient of high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In addition, the layer to be analyzed is exposed by the use of a chemical method due to acid treatment, only a very surface of the quartz specimen being decomposed by the use of the decomposition liquid to analyze. Accordingly, a very thin layer to be analyzed at an arbitrary depth can be analyzed as analysis unit, a distribution of the diffusion coefficients in the quartz specimen being able to analyze in a thickness direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the decomposition liquid is held owing to the surface tension of its own, contaminants from the container or the like can be suppressed to the minimum from mingling, resulting in the analysis of high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, classification of quartz due to manufacturing methods and differences of characteristics of the quartz are shown. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the quartz due to electric melting process is slight in amounts of both OH and metal, being considered to be the most suitable as material used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing another flow of an analysis method involving an embodiment different from one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> being a diagram schematically showing the circumstances implementing the present method. In the present embodiment, a method for calculating a volume of a layer to be analyzed in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is altered to another one. In addition to the above, a contact between a layer to be analyzed and a decomposition liquid is implemented, not by dripping the decomposition liquid, but in a container therein the decomposition liquid is accommodated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In implementing the analysis method involving the present embodiment, first for instance a rectangular or square specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is prepared, the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> being immersed in a surface treatment liquid, for instance hydrofluoric acid (HF), to etch a surface thereof <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The etched surface is a surface of a layer to be analyzed. For instance, a surface of a layer at a depth of 10 &mgr;m from the surface of the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is exposed (step <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). A thickness of the layer to be etched at this time can be controlled by appropriately adjusting the concentration of the treatment liquid such as hydrofluoric acid being used and conditions such as etching period and temperature. Hydrofluoric acid can be in any form of liquid and gaseous (vapor) forms. These are identical as the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Next, from in hydrofluoric acid the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is taken out, being cleaned and dried, thereafter a weight of the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is measured by means of a weighing device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). In measuring the weight, various kinds of known weighing methods may be used. Thus obtained weight is recorded as wn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Next, the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is put into a container <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> therein a decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, for instance, a mixed liquid of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid is contained, one surface of the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> being made to come into contact with the decomposition liquid (step <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>). At this time, the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be hydrofluoric acid alone, or a mixed liquid of hydrofluoric acid and other acid, for instance one or more of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, or a mixed liquid of hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen peroxide, or a mixed liquid of hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen peroxide and other acid for instance one or more of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Considering an easiness with which metal atoms in quartz dissolve into the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a mixed liquid of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid can be preferably used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Composition and concentration of the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and mixing ratio in the mixed liquid are preferably adjusted to values appropriate for decomposing a surface of quartz of the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by for instance 10 &mgr;m per approximately 30 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, after coming into contact, are maintained as they are at an appropriate temperature, the surface of the quartz specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> being decomposed by a very thin layer, by a layer of a thickness of for instance approximately 10 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Though the period and conditions when the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is maintained are design matter, these are preferably adjusted so that the surface of the quartz is decomposed by for instance approximately 10 &mgr;m per approximately 30 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Next, upon completion of the decomposition after a prescribed period, the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is recovered in a recovery container <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Thus obtained decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is subjected to quantitative analysis equipment, thereby metal contained in the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, for instance a content of copper being analyzed (step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>). At that time, whatever analysis equipment may be used as the quantitative analysis equipment, typically for instance an atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy), ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy) or the like may be used. An amount of metal obtained at this time is recorded as Cn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Next, a weight of the quartz specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of which surface is decomposed in the aforementioned step <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is measured in the manner identical with that in the step <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>). Thus obtained weight of the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is recorded as w<highlight><subscript>n&plus;1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Next, from thus obtained data, a metal concentration of the layer to be analyzed is calculated. That is, from the weights wn and w<highlight><subscript>n&plus;1 </subscript></highlight>of the specimens <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> obtained respectively in the steps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a weight of the layer to be analyzed is obtained as a difference thereof. With thus obtained weight and a density of the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> measured in advance, a volume Vn of the layer to be analyzed is obtained. With thus obtained volume and an area S of a surface of the layer to be analyzed that is measured in advance, a thickness thereof also can be calculated (step <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>). Thus obtained thickness is used to indicate a position in a depth direction of the layer to be analyzed in the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. In the volume Vn, the amount Cn obtained in the step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is contained. The metal concentration contained in the layer to be analyzed is given form Cn/Vn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Given the concentrations of metal, a diffusion coefficient D of the layer to be analyzed can be obtained from Fick&apos;s second law &part;c/&part;t&equals;D&middot;&part;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>C/&part;X<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, as ln C&equals;&minus;X<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/4Dt&plus;A. (In the equations, C: a concentration of metal at a depth X (atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>), D: a diffusion coefficient (cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s), X: depth (cm), t: diffusion time (sec), A: constant). By solving the above equation, the diffusion coefficient D can be obtained (step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>). The obtained diffusion coefficient is recorded as Dn (step <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Following this, whether a further inside layer is necessary to be analyzed quantitatively as a layer to be analyzed or not is judged (step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). When judged that the further quantitative analysis is necessary, returning to the step <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, with hydrofluoric acid, similarly for the further inside layer too, the steps from <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are repeated to obtain a diffusion coefficient D<highlight><subscript>n&plus;1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> After that, the steps <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are similarly repeated to analyze thin layers of a thickness of approximately 10 &mgr;m consecutively from the outside to the inside of the quartz specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the respective diffusion coefficients D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, - - - , D<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>n&plus;1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>n&plus;2</subscript></highlight>, - - - D<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>being obtained and recorded. Upon completion of the quantitative analysis of the innermost side of the layer to be analyzed, all the analysis operations are over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Even in the second embodiment explained in the above, with hydrofluoric acid a surface of a layer to be analyzed at a desired depth is exposed, thereafter a content of metal in the layer to be analyzed being analyzed. Accordingly, a metal content at an arbitrary depth of the specimen <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, in its turn a diffusion coefficient in the arbitrary layer, can be analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, with the decomposition liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> a layer to be analyzed is decomposed to quantitatively analyze. Accordingly, a very thin layer can be analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not restricted to the range disclosed in the aforementioned embodiments and embodiments. In the aforementioned embodiments and embodiments, the case of analyzing the concentration and diffusion coefficient of for instance copper contained in the quartz is explained as the example. However, the present invention can be similarly applied to metals other than copper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the aforementioned embodiments, the quartz specimens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are divided into multi-layers to be analyzed inwardly from the outside thereof, the layers to be analyzed each being successively quantitatively analyzed. However, the layer to be quantitatively analyzed may be one layer, or all analyzable layers of the quartz specimen <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be quantitatively analyzed from the outermost portion thereof, or only some layers to be analyzed at particular depths may be quantitatively analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> (Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Next, a third embodiment of the present invention will be explained. In embodiments following the present embodiment, the contents duplicating with that of the preceding embodiments will be omitted from explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, quartz material having, in a depth direction, 200 &mgr;m or more of a metal diffusion region of which diffusion coefficient obtained by the use of the analysis methods explained in the aforementioned first or second embodiments is 5.8 E-10 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s or less is used to manufacture a quartz tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> are flowcharts showing a flow of manufacturing steps of a quartz tube involving the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In implementing a manufacturing method of a quartz tube involving the present embodiment, first of all quartz material is sorted out (step <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>). At that time, a criterion for sorting out the quartz material is whether or not the material has 200 &mgr;m or more, in a depth direction, of a metal diffusion region of which diffusion coefficient is 5.8 E-10 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Here, a reason for sorting out one of which diffusion coefficient is in the aforementioned range is that when the diffusion coefficient is outside the range, metal atoms diffuse through the quartz in a short time to copy on wafers being treated. Thus, an inconvenience that causes an occurrence of poor quality due to so-called contamination is invited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> As another index, other than the diffusion coefficient, for judging quality of quartz material, a content of hydroxy group can be cited. In specific, the quartz material of which content of hydroxy group is 60 &mgr;g/g or less is preferably used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Here, a reason for restricting a preferable range of the hydroxy group content to the aforementioned one is as follows. When the content of the hydroxy group is outside of the aforementioned range, a region of which diffusion coefficient of metal in the quartz material is 5.8 E-10 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s or less can not satisfy the depth of 200 &mgr;m. As a result, the metal atoms diffuse through the quartz in a short time to copy on wafers being treated, causing as so-called contamination an inconvenience of an occurrence of poor quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> This is because there are considered the following relationship between the number of hydroxy group in the quartz material and the diffusion coefficient thereof. That is, when the number of the hydroxy group increases, the diffusion coefficient also increases, in other words, a region of small diffusion coefficient in a depth direction becomes shallower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> As the support thereof, the followings are found from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. That is, in the quartz manufactured due to the electric melting process in which metal atoms are confirmed to diffuse with relative difficulty, an amount of hydroxy group is lower. On the other hand, in the quartz manufactured due to flame fusion method in which metal atoms are confirmed to diffuse with relative easiness, the amount of hydroxy group is higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when compared with the quartz material manufactured due to the flame fusion method, it is preferable to manufacture a quartz tube with the quartz material manufactured due to the electric melting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as still another index other than the diffusion coefficient, a density of the quartz material can be cited. In specific, it is preferable to use the quartz material of which density is in the range of 2.2016 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to 2.2027 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Here, the reason for restricting the preferable value of the density in the aforementioned range is as follows. That is, when the density deviates out of the aforementioned range, a region of which diffusion coefficient of metal in the quartz material is 5.8E-10 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s or less does not reach a depth of 200 &mgr;m. As a result, the metal atoms diffuse through the quartz in a short time to be copied on wafers being treated. Thus, so called contamination is caused to result in an inconvenience of an occurrence of poor quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The relationship between the density of the quartz material and the diffusion coefficient therein is considered as follows. That is, when the density deviates out of the aforementioned range, the diffusion coefficient becomes larger, in other words, a region in a depth direction of which diffusion coefficient is small becomes shallower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as still another index other than the diffusion coefficient, a copper content in the quartz material can be cited. In specific, it is preferable to use the quartz material of which copper content is 5 ng/g or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Here, the reason for restricting the preferable copper content in the aforementioned range is as follows. That is, when the copper content deviates out of the aforementioned range, a region of which diffusion coefficient of metal in the quartz material is 5.8E-10 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s or less does not reach a depth of 200 &mgr;m. As a result, the metal atoms diffuse through the quartz in a short time to be copied on wafers being treated. Thus, so called contamination is caused to result in an inconvenience of an occurrence of poor quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> This is because the relationship between the copper content in the quartz material and the diffusion coefficient thereof is considered as follows. That is, when the copper content increases, the diffusion coefficient becomes larger, in other words, a region in a depth direction of which diffusion coefficient is small becomes shallower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The quartz material thus sorted out, after cutting in a length necessary for manufacturing a quartz tube shown in an outline shape <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>, is cleaned (step <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>). The cleaning is performed, before the following machining, of all material including quartz material with hydrofluoric acid and deionized water. For instance, with 5% hydrofluoric acid the cleaning is carried out for more than 10 min, followed by cleaning with deionized water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Next, it is air dried in a clean room (step <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>), followed by, while shaping one end side on a lathe in a hemisphere like an outline shape <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, closing to seal round (step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>). Similarly, while rotating on the lathe, an open end side is spread outwardly in a diameter direction to shape a flange (step <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a branch pipe for feeding a gas into the quartz tube is welded to shape like an outline shape <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>. Then, by annealing, strain caused during the welding is relieved (step <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>). The annealing is carried out for instance at a temperature between 1050 to 1200&deg; C. for 30 to 240 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Next, when cleaned with hydrofluoric acid, the cleaning with deionized water is followed (step <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>). The cleaning, for instance, after cleaning with 5% hydrofluoric acid for more than 10 min, is performed by the use of deionized water. Then, for instance in a clean room, it is air dried (step <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Next, a flange portion shaped in the step <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is ground by the use of a grinder <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>), followed by cleaning (step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). The cleaning, for instance, after cleaning with 5% hydrofluoric acid for more than 10 min, is performed by the use of deionized water. Then, for instance in a clean room, it is air dried (step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Then, the obtained quartz tube is fired by means of a burner to carry out firing (step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). A firing temperature at this time is cited as still another index other than the diffusion coefficient. In concrete, the firing temperature is preferable to be in the range of 1050 to 1500&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Here, the reason for restricting the preferable firing temperature in the aforementioned range is as follows. That is, when the firing temperature deviates out of the aforementioned range, a region of which diffusion coefficient of metal in the quartz material is 5.8E-10 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s or less does not reach a depth of 200 &mgr;m. As a result, the metal atoms diffuse through the quartz in a short time to be copied on wafers being treated. Thus, so called contamination is caused to result in an inconvenience of an occurrence of poor quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> This is because the relationship between the firing temperature and the diffusion coefficient of the quartz material is considered as follows. That is, when the firing temperature deviates outside of the aforementioned range, the diffusion coefficient becomes larger, in other words, a region in a depth direction of which diffusion coefficient is small becomes shallower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Next, by annealing again, strain is relieved (step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). The annealing is implemented for instance at a temperature in the range of 1050 to 1200&deg; C. for 30 to 240 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Next, when cleaned by hydrofluoric acid, the cleaning with deionized water is followed (step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). The cleaning, for instance, after cleaning with 5% hydrofluoric acid for more than 10 min, is performed by the use of deionized water. Then, for instance in a clean room, it is air dried (step <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Thus manufactured quartz tube is further inspected (step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>) to be finally a completed product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> According to a manufacturing method of the present embodiment, in a stage of material sorting, by the use of the analysis method shown in the first or second embodiments an accurate diffusion coefficient can be obtained. Owing to thus obtained diffusion coefficient, quartz material furnished with adequate physical properties can be sorted out, a quartz tube being manufactured by the use of the sorted quartz material. Accordingly, quartz tubes that can be heat-treated without causing the contamination due to metal atoms can be manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> (Fourth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In the following, a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an entire configuration of thermal treatment equipment. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a vertical treatment furnace for treating semiconductor wafers, objects to be treated, under a high temperature, the treatment furnace <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprising a level base plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a circular opening <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the central portion thereof. In the opening <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the base plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted through as a cylindrical treatment tube that is open at a lower end and has a flange portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the open end. A periphery portion of the flange portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is removably attached to the base plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through a manifold <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In addition, at a lower side portion of the quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an inlet tube portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for introducing a treatment gas and an exhaust tube portion not shown in the figure for exhausting the treatment gas are formed in one body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> At the periphery portion of the quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for heating the inside of the quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is disposed. Between the heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an equalizing tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disposed concentrically with the quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to cover the quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to equalize the heating due to the heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A heat generating resistance wire <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>consisting of alloy of iron (Fe), chromium (Cr) and aluminum (Al) is wound in coil to form the heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Outside and above thereof, an insulator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is disposed to cover it, the outside of the insulator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> being covered by an outer shell not shown in the figure. As the heat generating resistance wire <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>one consisting of molybdenum disilicide (MoSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or kanthal (trade name) is also applicable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is divided into a plurality (for instance 3 to 5) of zones in a height direction, to the respective zones temperature sensors <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> being disposed to enable to independently temperature-control the respective zones. The heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the insulator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the outer shell are supported on the base plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.

The closing plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> takes the wafer boat <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> into and out of the quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, being connected to an elevator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> for opening/closing the closing plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Next, an operation of thus configured heat treatment apparatus will be. explained. The inside of the quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the treatment furnace <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is heated in advance by the heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to a prescribed temperature, being gas purged by nitrogen gas. In this state, the closing plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is opened, the wafer boat <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> holding the semiconductor wafers being introduced into the quartz tube <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> together with the heat insulating mould <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> due to an ascending movement of the closing plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>.
