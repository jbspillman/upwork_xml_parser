<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a technology for optimizing the operating speed and power consumption of transistors by controlling a threshold voltage by way of applying a bias voltage to a support substrate beneath a buried oxide film in a MOS type semiconductor apparatus formed with an SOI substrate. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In modern MOS-type semiconductor apparatuses, along with the miniaturization of device dimensions, an increase in operating speed and improvement in low-power consumption are being advanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition, a decrease in power source voltage has advanced, and the effect the threshold voltage of a transistor has on the operating speed of the transistor or the leak current while turned off is becoming bigger. In other words, as the threshold voltage increases, the leak current while turned off decreases, and power consumption is also reduced, but the operating speed of the transistor becomes slower. Conversely, as the threshold voltage decreases, the operating speed of the transistor becomes faster, but the leak current while turned off increases, and power consumption increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the threshold voltage varies to some extent for each chip product. As a result, for a MOS-type semiconductor apparatus, which uses a plurality of chips, as a whole, a loss is incurred in that the design must be adapted to the slowest of the varying operating speeds among the chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In relation to such a problem, for a bulk process where source areas and drain areas are formed on the surface of a silicon wafer, a method utilizing the substrate bias effect in order to control the threshold is being studied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, when the substrate bias effect is utilized in a bulk process, there are problems in that because the substrate and the source areas or the drain areas have PN-junctions, leak currents in the reverse direction increase, and in that holes generated via impact ionization accumulate in the substrate, causing the substrate potential to change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention aims at adjusting the threshold voltage to a predetermined value in a MOS-type semiconductor apparatus, decreasing leak currents without reducing the operating speed of the transistors, and lowering power consumption. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present inventors discovered that in an SOI (silicon on insulator) type MOS-type semiconductor apparatus, when conductors are provided in a support substrate beneath an insulation layer (a so-called buried oxide film), and a bias voltage is applied to the conductors, because the conductors and the source areas or the drain areas are insulated via the buried oxide film, unlike a case where the substrate bias effect is used in a bulk process, a problem of increased leak currents in the opposite direction does not arise, and further that, when an oscillator is formed in a MOS-type semiconductor apparatus, by comparing signals generated by this oscillator to a reference signal inputted from outside, and by setting a bias voltage based on the difference between both signals, the threshold voltage can be optimized at an arbitrary value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In other words, the present invention provides a semiconductor apparatus which is a MOS-type semiconductor apparatus formed with an SOI substrate in which a support substrate, an insulation layer and a semiconductor layer are sequentially layered, and which has conductors beneath the insulation layer, and further has a threshold-value control circuit which compares signals formed by an oscillator in the semiconductor apparatus to a reference signal inputted from outside, and applies a bias voltage to the conductors based on the difference between both signals.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail with reference to the drawings. In the drawings, identical reference numerals express identical or equivalent component elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> are a schematic top surface view (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) and a cross sectional view (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) of one example of an embodiment where the present invention is applied to a MOS-type semiconductor apparatus of an SOI type having a full-depletion type C-MOS (complementary MOS) transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An SOI type semiconductor apparatus is a semiconductor apparatus formed with an SOI substrate in which semiconductor layers (SOI layers) comprising a support substrate, an insulation layer (buried oxide film), and single-crystal Si are sequentially layered, and it is known that complete isolation of each element becomes easier, and that suppression of soft errors and latch-up which are particular to C-MOS type transistors becomes possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition, among SOI type semiconductor apparatuses, those which have a full-depletion type transistor in which the SOI layer is reduced to approximately 100 nm in thickness, and in which the entire SOI layer is substantially depleted by controlling the impurity density of a channel formed in the SOI layer directly beneath a gate electrode to a relatively low state have superior characteristics such as reduced diffused layer capacitance and a sharp rise of drain current in the sub-threshold area, and practical application to portable electronic apparatuses is expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A MOS-type semiconductor apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> is a MOS-type semiconductor apparatus comprising a full-depletion type C-MOS transistor to which the construction of the present invention is applied. By applying the construction of the present invention to a semiconductor apparatus comprising a full-depletion type transistor, it is possible to effectively control the threshold voltage by applying a bias voltage, and thus it is quite desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The MOS-type semiconductor apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> differs from conventional SOI-type semiconductor apparatuses in that in order to enable application of bias voltages V<highlight><subscript>sub1 </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>sub2</subscript></highlight>, it comprises P-wells (PWL) and N-wells (NWL) as conductors in a support substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> beneath a buried oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and in that terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to which a bias voltage is applied are pulled out to the upper surface, and it also differs in that a threshold-value control circuit is provided between the terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and earth lines L<highlight><subscript>V0 </subscript></highlight>drawn out from the P-wells (PWL) or the N-wells (NWL) so that the predetermined bias voltages V<highlight><subscript>sub1 </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>sub2 </subscript></highlight>can be applied between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, P-MOS transistors or N-MOS transistors comprising a source area S and a drain area D formed with an SOI layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the buried oxidized film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed thereon via a gate oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is constructed in a manner similar to full-depletion type SOI-type C-MOS type semiconductor apparatuses of public knowledge. An interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed on the P-MOS transistors and the N-MOS transistors, on which power-supply wirings L<highlight><subscript>Vdd </subscript></highlight>and the earth lines L<highlight><subscript>V0 </subscript></highlight>are provided. Note that in the figures, wirings formed in the inter-layer insulation film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Such a MOS-type semiconductor apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be obtained by, for example, performing device isolation through the trench method on the SOI substrate based on the SIMOX (separation by implanted oxygen) method, forming the P-wells (PWL) and the N-wells (NWL) by way of ion implantation via the buried oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and subsequently forming the N-MOS transistors or the P-MOS transistors by conventional methods. In other words, after forming the P-wells (PWL) and the N-wells (NWL), the gate oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed via thermal oxidation of the surface of the SOI layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed thereon, LDD areas, the source areas S, and the drain areas D are formed via ion implantation with the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as a mask, the inter-layer insulation film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is layered, and the various wirings and terminals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In forming the P-wells (PWL) and the N-wells (NWL), it is preferable that the polarity of impurities be set such that the P-wells (PWL) and the N-wells (NWL) become accumulated layers (accumulation) in accordance with the values of the bias voltages V<highlight><subscript>sub1 </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>sub2 </subscript></highlight>applied thereto. Further, in a case where the support substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is earthed, it is preferable that the support substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> be formed with a triple-well structure, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> For the gate electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, it is preferable that N-type or P-type polysilicon, or a high-melting point metal such as W, Ti or a high-melting point intermetallic compound such as TiN having work functions around the mid-gap of Si be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, in a C-MOS construction in which the N-MOS and the P-MOS are alternately disposed, it is preferable that bias voltages V<highlight><subscript>sub1 </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>sub2 </subscript></highlight>appropriate for each row of the P-wells (PWL) and the N-wells (NWL) be applied simultaneously. In this case, it is preferable, ordinarily, that the bias voltage V<highlight><subscript>sub1 </subscript></highlight>applied to the P-wells (PWL) and the bias voltage V<highlight><subscript>sub2 </subscript></highlight>applied to the N-wells (NWL) be set such that V<highlight><subscript>sub1</subscript></highlight>&equals;&minus;V<highlight><subscript>sub2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block configuration diagram of a threshold-value control circuit utilized in the MOS-type semiconductor apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. This threshold-value control circuit is an application of a publicly known AFC (Automatic Frequency Control) circuit, and it comprises a ring oscillator which oscillates signals based on drive currents of an arbitrary N-MOS or P-MOS transistor in the semiconductor apparatus, a frequency divider which down-converts the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator, a phase detector into which signals f (SOI) from the frequency divider and reference signals f (ref) of a constant frequency from outside are inputted, a charge pump (Charge Pumping) circuit which enables the application of bias voltages at a voltage higher than the power source voltage, and a low-pass filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the relationship between the bias voltage V<highlight><subscript>sub </subscript></highlight>and the threshold voltage V<highlight><subscript>th </subscript></highlight>of a full-depletion type N-MOS transistor is simulated, the results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are obtained. Conditions for this simulation are T<highlight><subscript>OX</subscript></highlight>/T<highlight><subscript>SOI</subscript></highlight>/T<highlight><subscript>BOX</subscript></highlight>&equals;3.5/30/100 nm, threshold value judging current&equals;0.1 &mgr;A/&mgr;m. Further the dotted line is a relationship diagram for the bias voltage V<highlight><subscript>sub </subscript></highlight>and the threshold voltage V<highlight><subscript>th </subscript></highlight>generated by variations in physical dimensions. The area marked by oblique lines is a normal operating range of the N-MOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As such, the threshold-value control circuit compensates for variations in the threshold voltage V<highlight><subscript>th </subscript></highlight>caused by variations in the manufacture of chips or by the in-use environment by optimizing the bias voltages V<highlight><subscript>sub1 </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>sub2 </subscript></highlight>applied to the P-wells (PWL) or the N-wells (NWL), and adjusts the threshold voltage V<highlight><subscript>th </subscript></highlight>such that it is within the normal operating range of a transistor. For example, with respect to an N-MOS chip whose threshold voltage V<highlight><subscript>th </subscript></highlight>is high, leak current is low, operating speed is slow, and thus whose signal f (SOI) is slow, when the initial bias voltage V<highlight><subscript>sub </subscript></highlight>is 0V (refer to dot A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), if a difference between the signal f (SOI) and the reference signal f (ref) is detected by the phase detector, the bias voltage V<highlight><subscript>sub </subscript></highlight>applied to the N-MOS chip from the charge pump circuit becomes 4V, and a predetermined operating speed (refer to dot B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) can be obtained. In addition, when a predetermined operating speed is already obtained, a difference between the signal f (SOI) and the reference signal f (ref) is not detected by the phase detector. Accordingly, in this case, the bias voltage applied from the charge pump circuit is held at 4V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the modes described above, and may take various modes. For example, conductors in a support substrate to which a bias voltage is applied are not only limited to wells formed via ion implantation in the support substrate, but may also be back gate electrodes formed beneath the buried oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention can be applied to semiconductor apparatuses comprising long-channel transistors, and is not limited to full-depletion type transistors whose thickness of the SOI layer is roughly 100 nm or below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to the MOS-type semiconductor apparatus of the present invention, because the optimal threshold voltage can be set depending on the required operating speed and the like regardless of variations in manufacture among the chips or of changes in temperature, leak current can be reduced and power consumption can be lowered without lowering the operating speed of the transistors. Further, because the margin of irregularity during design can thus be estimated to be less, it is possible to enhance the minimum operating speed of the chips. </paragraph>
