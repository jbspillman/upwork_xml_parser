<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is generally directed to a device for generating a stream of solid particulate matter or liquid which is provided at sufficient pressure and velocity so that it can remove solid debris, difficult stains and other unwanted materials (e.g. glues, adhesives, etc.). The device can be constructed on a large scale for and removal of unwanted materials from large objects such as platforms, floors and the like. The device can also be constructed on a small scale wherein the substrate may be as small as a large size coin. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Devices for generating a stream of pressurized particulate matter such as sand blasters are known in the art. Such devices employ solid particulate matter (e.g. sand) which has been accelerated by a pressurized gas or liquid to provide a pressurized stream which can be directed at a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such devices are successful in generating a pressurized stream of solid particulate matter. However, they suffer from a number of disadvantages including a lack of control of the substrate damage due to the pressurized stream and problems with cleaning up the solid particulate matter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Most devices employ an abrasive material as the solid particulate matter such as sand, glass beads, and plastic beads. Most of the solid abrasive materials customarily employed are difficult to dispose of after use and/or present environmental problems. This is because the solid particles must be collected or swept from the area around the substrate and properly disposed of. This requires significant cost and in some cases the solid particulate matter comes under environmental scrutiny leading to waste disposal problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For those devices which employ non-abrasive materials, they are disadvantageous because they do not provide the combination of manageable size and control of the pressurized stream and/or are not easily connected to a single fluid source through conventional fluid supplying and pressurizing equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would therefore be a significant advance in the art of treating substrates with a pressurized stream of a treating media in the form of a solid particulate matter, liquid or mixtures thereof if sufficient control can be provided to the stream by controlling the rate and pattern of flow of the treating media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It would be a further advance in the art if the treating media was safe and effective to use and could be easily disposed of without raising environmental concerns. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention is generally directed to a device for generating a pressurized stream of a treating media employing a vessel for combining the treating media and a pressurized fluid stream, a pressurized fluid delivery assembly for delivering the pressurized fluid to the vessel and a conduit for transporting the pressurized treating media out of the vessel and towards a substrate for cleaning or other similar purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As used herein the term &ldquo;treating media&rdquo; shall mean any solid particulate matter or any liquid or mixtures thereof which can be pressurized and delivered towards a substrate for cleaning or other purposes. Examples of solid particulate matter include, but are not limited to, bicarbonates, carbonates, oxides, silicas, plastic materials, glass beads and the like. Examples of liquids include, but are not limited to, surfactants, detergents, solvents and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown an embodiment of a device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention for delivering a pressurized stream of treating media. By way of example only, the treating media will be hereinafter described with regard to the drawing figures as &ldquo;solid particulate matter&rdquo;. The device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is loaded with the solid particulate matter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> up to an upper level <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. An opening <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided at the top of the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> enabling a conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to extend into the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> toward the bottom end thereof. The conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has an opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which, as explained hereinafter, provides an entry for pressurized solid particulate matter to enter the conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extends out of the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> where it is in operable connection with a fluid delivery assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As used herein, the term &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; is intended to cover gases, liquids and combinations thereof. The fluid delivery assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a source of compressed fluid (not shown) which may be within or without the device which plugs into a connecting assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> including optionally a water vapor trap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for removing water from the pressurized fluid, (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) a shut-off valve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which may include a pressure gauge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to monitor the pressure of the pressurized fluid. A pressure release valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be provided to prevent against over pressurization the device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> including the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The pressure release valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be located at any point which is in contact with the pressurized fluid emanating from the source thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the connecting assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to a manifold <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which provides the opportunity for the pressurized fluid to be delivered to the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and in a particular embodiment of the invention to provide a separate stream of pressurized fluid upward through the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which extends out of the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the particular aspect of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receives pressurized fluid from the fluid delivery assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which enters the top end of the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The pressurized fluid exerts pressure on and mixes with the solid particulate matter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to provide a pressurized stream of solid particulate matter for entry into the opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At the same time, a separate stream of pressurized fluid enters the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a point above the upper level <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the solid particulate matter through an opening within the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As shown specifically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is positioned within the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a point within the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The pressurized fluid enters the opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and thereby creates a pressure differential which draws the pressurized solid particulate matter entering the opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> upward through the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that it may proceed to a pressurized stream of solid particulate matter delivery system hereinafter designated by numeral <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In an alternative aspect of the present invention as shown specifically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the pressurized fluid enters an opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at a point outside the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment of the invention, the pressurized fluid stream from the fluid delivery assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be branched so that a portion of the pressurized fluid goes down into the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as previously explained and another portion enters the opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to create the pressure differential as previously described. The opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may typically be at the junction of the conduits <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or in close proximity thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which provides access to the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the pressurized fluid should be of sufficient size to enable a sufficient amount of pressurized fluid to enter the conduit and create a sufficient pressure differential so as to assist in drawing the pressurized solid particulate stream upward through the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The size of the opening may vary depending on the size of the conduit. In general, the ratio of the size of the opening and the internal dimension of the conduit (e.g. diameter) is from about 1:1 to 1:20, preferably at or about 1:10. By way of example, a conduit having a diameter of 0.25 inch would suitably have an opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>measuring about 0.25 inch. As previously indicated, the size and shape of the opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may vary so long as a sufficient pressure differential is created to assist in drawing the pressurized treating media stream such as a pressurized solid particulate matter stream through the delivery system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a bypass valve assembly incorporating a fluid control device such as a ball valve or needle valve may be used to provide a pressurized fluid stream from the conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a location within the manifold <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the solid particulate matter delivery system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an extension of the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or a second conduit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connected to the first conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through a connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Such connectors are well known in the art. The second conduit is provided at an end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> opposed from the connected end with an opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which may deliver the pressurized solid particulate matter to a substrate. In a preferred embodiment of the invention as specifically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is provided a nozzle assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which provides for the controlled release of the pressurized stream of solid particulate matter from the device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has at least one opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for emitting the pressurized particulate matter. The nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be provided with multiple openings <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to provide larger coverage of the targeted substrate. It will be understood that the size of the opening or openings <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be routinely adjusted depending on whether the treating media is a solid particulate matter, a liquid or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a preferred form of the invention, the treating media is solid particulate matter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and is principally made of water soluble compounds such as bicarbonates (e.g. sodium and calcium bicarbonates) or carbonates (e.g. calcium carbonate) so that they can be readily dissolved and washed away in the clean up operation. This provides distinct advantages over prior art systems which employ non-soluble solid particulate matter (e.g. sand) which provides more difficult clean up. Bicarbonates and carbonates also provide advantages oversolid particulate matter materials (e.g. water soluble, easy waste disposal, non-toxic, non-substrate damaging) which present environmental concerns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is typically made of materials which can withstand pressurization typically up to and exceeding 300 psi. In most cases, for moderate sized cleaning operations, a vessel rated to 120 psi is acceptable. The vessel can be made of a variety of plastic and metal materials. For long term use, steel is the preferred material of construction because of its long term resistance to abrasion. Plastics are the preferred materials for short term or disposable units because they are relatively inexpensive to produce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> employed within the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a rigid plastic or metal material. The preferred materials are the same as those that may be used to construct the vessel. The conduit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as previously indicated, may merely be an extension of the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In a preferred form of the invention, the conduit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is made of a flexible materials that are appropriately pressure rated and desirably abrasive resistant (for long term use) such as rubbers, rubber composites, polypropylene, polyethylene, and combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The operation of the device of the present invention is as follows. Pressurized fluid is applied to the device by opening the pressure shut off valve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that the source of the pressurized fluid may be contained within or without the device. Pressurized fluid then enters the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> therein to provide pressurized treating media such as solid particulate matter which enters the opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At the same time pressurized fluid enters the conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to assist in drawing the pressurized particulate matter through the conduits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and out the opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the delivery system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Preferably there is provided a nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to assist in controlling the release of the pressurized stream of the treating media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The device of the present invention may be used in conjunction with a protective device over at least the nozzle to minimize the area over which the treating media is sprayed during cleaning. </paragraph>
