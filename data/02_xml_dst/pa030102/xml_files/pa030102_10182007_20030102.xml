<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention concerns a device for monitoring a conveyor facility having a top strand and a bottom strand. Said conveyor facility comprises a conveyor belt (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) made of elastomer material having a carrying side for the material to be conveyed and a backing side (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), whereby the conveyor belt has at the most one strengthening support. The conveyor facility also comprises other parts such as driving drum, tail pulley, deflection drum, carrying rollers (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), supporting structure, feed chute and optionally other components. The device according to the invention is characterized in that it includes an optoelectronic system (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) in area (X) where there are no carrying rollers (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). Said system optically detects and reports any damage to the conveyor belt (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) by monitoring the backing side (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), optionally in connection with automatic switch-off of the conveyor facility. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a device for monitoring a conveyor system having a top strand and a bottom strand and comprising </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> a conveyor belt of elastomeric material with a top side for the material to be conveyed and a bottom side, the conveyor belt usually being provided with an embedded carcass, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> other system parts, namely drive pulley, tail pulley, corner pulley, support rollers, conveyor structure, feed chute and possibly further components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conveyor belts are subjected to large stresses and strains where the loose material to be conveyed is dropped on them. Since uniform lump size cannot be ensured, especially in mining, damage is frequently suffered by the top side of the conveyor belt, usually associated with consequent damage involving the carcass and the bottom side. Such damage then becomes increasingly greater and ultimately leads to failure of the conveyor belt in the absence of timely repairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition, foreign bodies can cause isolated perforations of the conveyor belt. Foreign bodies can be chute parts, support rollers and other components of the conveyor system. Tools, trimming residues in foundries and sharp-edged materials present in the conveyed product are also hazard sources. If a foreign body is dropped in unfavorable manner, the body can become jammed in a system part. The conveyor belt becomes perforated and continues to run almost without hindrance, because the force driving the conveyor belt is much greater than the resistance of the conveyor belt to the jammed foreign body. This situation results in lengthwise slitting of the conveyor belt. In most cases, it is then impossible or uneconomical to repair the conveyor belt. The resulting damage is considerable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Beyond this, conveyor belts with steel cables as tension supports are exposed to further hazards on the bottom side of the conveyor belt. For example, individual cables can stick out, especially within the region of joints. These cables become trapped in the system construction, for example in the support rollers, and thus lead to considerable damage or even complete destruction of the conveyor belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Similarly, if the covering rubber of the bottom side becomes damaged, dangling rubber shreds can be formed and also become trapped in the construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Heretofore such forms of damage have frequently been detected through visual inspections by the system personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Automatic detection has been achieved heretofore in the form of mechanical devices, such as a wire suspended underneath the conveyor belt. As soon as this wire becomes entangled with dangling parts of the belt, the anchoring of the wire is detached and thus generates an electrical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another device comprises conductor loops (German Patent C 4444264), which are vulcanized into the conveyor belt at specified intervals, such as 50 m. In the event of damage to a conductor loop, especially because of slitting effects, an electroinductive circuit is broken, leading via detectors to shutdown of the conveyor system. Conductor loops are made of fine metal cords, which react sensitively to external influences such as constant impacts as well as alternation of longitudinal and transverse bending. They frequently cause false alarms. Their service life is very limited. Moreover, this method is not suitable for detection of all of the aforesaid causes of damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is now to provide, for monitoring a conveyor system, a device that is capable of early detection of many forms of damage to the conveyor belt and that in addition is wear-free, requires little maintenance and is economic with minimum possible complexity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved according to the body of claim 1 by the fact that the device is equipped, in the region in which support rollers are not present, with an optoelectronic system that optically detects and signals damage to a conveyor belt by observing the bottom side, and if necessary shuts down the conveyor system automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Expedient embodiments of the invention are specified in claims 2 to 7.</paragraph>
