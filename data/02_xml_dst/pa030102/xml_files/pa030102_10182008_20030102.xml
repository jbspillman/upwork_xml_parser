<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an elongate stamping device, preferably in the form of a pen, comprising an ink pad support for an ink pad, the ink pad support being pivotably mounted on a handle, and a stamping plate for a printing block, the stamping plate being pivotably mounted on a holding arm, wherein, when in use, the stamping plate, in the inking position, rests on the ink pad with the printing block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Pen-type stamping devices have already been known which possibly are even integrated into a writing tool, and which are compact and comfortable to take along. These stamping devices, however, have a very narrow stamping area, since the latter is restricted by the circular diameter of the pen-shaped stamping device, and thus it is not possible to accommodate a standard private stamp having a width of adequate size so as to accommodate the information required (e.g. name and address), since the diameter of the pen then would lie in a range in which the stamping device would not be handy anymore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> From CA 2 028 611 A, such a writing tool is known in which a pen-shaped stamping device can be screwed into the cap. The stamping device substantially consists of a holding means on which both a carrier for the ink pad as well as the stamping plate are pivotably mounted&mdash;on a holding arm. In the pivoted-in inking or resting position, ink pad and stamping plate will rest on each other resulting in the pen shape of the stamping device. Yet also there the width of the stamping plate is restricted to the diameter of the pen, resulting in a very restricted possibility of housing the stamp characters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is now an object of the invention to provide an elongate stamping device of the initially defined type, which has a comparatively large width of the stamping plate and thus allows for a larger stamping area, wherein a plurality of different stamping characters can be used, while still providing the user with a stamping device that is easy to use and which will rest well in the user&apos;s hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The inventive stamping device of the initially defined type is characterised in that the width of the stamping plate or of the ink pad support, respectively, is larger than the entire thickness of the holding arm, the stamping plate with the printing block and the ink pad support for the ink pad in the inking position. This results in an elongate stamping device which differs from the previously known stamping devices of generally circular cross-section and which has a substantially flat crosssectional shape, enabling, on the one hand, a handy configuration capable of being inserted like a pen, and, on the other hand, a stamping area of larger width, whereby substantially more symbols or stamping characters can be housed, e.g. so as to provide a standard private stamp. When in use, the stamping plate and the ink pad are transferred from the closed inking position into an open stamping position in which the stamping plate is provided substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the stamping device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To prevent the stamping device from soiling something with its ink during transportation thereof and to maintain the stamping device in the inking position it is advantageous if in the inking position, a removable slip-on sleeve is provided which surrounds the holding arm, the stamping plate and the ink pad support and whose open end follows upon the handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For great ease of handling and for an optically pleasing shape, it is suitable if the cross-section of the sleeve is oval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Likewise, it may be advantageous, e.g. for suitable stacking, if the cross-section of the sleeve is rectangular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The surface of the sleeve is particularly well suited for advertisement prints, if the cross-section of the sleeve has two parallel partial regions which are interconnected via two curved partial regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For a high operating comfort despite a simple design, where the user has to do as little as possible by himself, it is advantageous if the stamping plate is mounted eccentrically on the holding arm so as to automatically pivot outwards into the stamping position on account of gravity when the sleeve is taken off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For a comfortable handling it is also suitable if the bearing of the stamping plate on the holding arm is provided with a spring so as to automatically pivot outward into the stamping position when the sleeve is taken off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For the stamping plate to be stopped in the stamping position when it pivots outwards, it is also advantageous if a stop for the stamping plate in its outward-pivoted position is provided on one side of the holding arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to enable the use of different stamping plates with different printing blocks in the stamping device it is suitable if the stamping plate is releasably connected with the holding arm, e.g. by a snap connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To attain the press-on pressure of the ink pad on the printing block required for inking it is suitable if the printing block has a thickness of between 1.7 and 2.3 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To prevent the-ink pad support from impeding the stamping procedure, it is advantageous if the plane defined by the ink pad support in the inking position encloses an obtuse angle with the longitudinal axis of the stamping device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> To render the transition from the closed inking position to the open stamping position as automatic as possible for the user, it is advantageous if the bearing of the ink pad support is provided with a spring so as to automatically pivot outwards into the stamping position when the sleeve is taken off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Particularly with a view to the comparatively wide shape of the stamping device, it is suitable if the spring is a leg spring which is mounted on the pivot axis of the ink pad support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> To compensate for different heights of different printing blocks and to thus ensure a uniform support of the printing block on the ink pad in the inking position, it is suitable if an ink pad support arm of the ink pad support has a long hole for receiving a bearing pin, the longitudinal axis of the long hole extending substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the stamping device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> For a stamping area in which a plurality of different motives can be printed it is suitable if the printing block has a printing surface the width of which is larger than &frac13; of its length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For using private stamps with standard dimensions it is advantageous if the printing block has a printing surface the width of which is larger than 9 mm and the length of which is larger than 35 mm, and which preferably has a width of 14 mm and a length of 38 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> To obtain a high number of prints without refilling the ink reservoir with ink, it is suitable if the height of the ink pad is larger than 2 mm, preferably is equal to 3 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Despite the comparatively thick ink pad, the ink from the ink reservoir will be used up after several printing procedures, and thus the stamping device will not be usable any longer or will be usable to a limited extent only. Since a re-saturation with an ink bottle often will lead to imprints of lower quality, it is advantageous if the carrying arm is releasably connected with the ink pad support so as to allow for a simple exchange of pads and to allow for a long use of the stamping device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The releasable connection can be realized in a particularly simple and inexpensive manner if the carrying arm is connected to the ink pad support via an e.g. dovetail-shaped insertion rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> To secure the rail in longitudinal direction in the ink pad support, it is suitable if the insertion rail is connected with the ink pad support by means of latching projections.</paragraph>

Sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises a clip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which assists in putting the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in breast pockets, e.g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>different cross-sectional shapes of the slip-on sleeve are schematically shown, the slip-on sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having an elliptical cross-section. Further preferred embodiments have a rectangular cross-section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; or a long-hole-shaped cross-section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&Prime;, which is comprised of two parallel edges and two segments of a circle. All the cross-sectional shapes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&Prime; share the feature that width B is larger than thickness D, and thus a large stamping area is achieved with great ease of handling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a perspective view of the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a closed inking position, with sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having been omitted. Handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is followed by a holding arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on which a stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is mounted so as to be pivotable about an axle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that extends transversely to the longitudinal direction of the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. To realize the pivotable mounting, a gripping part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (with snapping projections) of the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises the axle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the holding arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which axle is provided in a recess <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the holding arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This results in an easily pivotable and well releasable mounting which allows for a simple exchange or insertion of different stamping plates <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The printing block <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime; glued to the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has an area contact on an ink pad <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is glued into an ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. For a positive-fit and frictional engagement between sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided with a bead <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which, in the closed state, will snap into a corresponding groove (not illustrated) on the inner side of sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a side-view of the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the ink pad <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the closed inking position, in which the printing block <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime; glued to the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> rests on the ink pad <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with its entire surface. The ink pad <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is glued to the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which has reinforcing ribs <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, e.g. in cross-shaped arrangement (cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) on its rear side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;. Via a forked carrying arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to the handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to be pivotable about a bearing pin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a long hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime; is entered in broken lines in carrying arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, whereby the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the inking position has a slight play perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and thus different thicknesses of the printing block <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime; are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the hinging of the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the forked ink pad support arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be seen in top view. Moreover, a spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be seen between the two fork arms of the ink pad support arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which causes automatic outward pivoting of the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is taken off. In the view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the broad side of the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown with an elliptical cross-section, wherein the width b of the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be larger than in a stamping device having a circular cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a view of the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> onto the rear side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the releasable bearing of the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by aid of the gripping part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> on axle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the holding arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be seen. For as compact a construction as possible, the holding arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has an opening <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which allows the gripping part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to engage on axle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the broad side of the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown, whereby the width b&prime; of the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is particularly clearly visible, which is larger as compared to circular, pen-shaped stamping device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As is moreover visible from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the front-side end of the holding arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is rounded on one side at <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime;, so as to allow for the pivoting of the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, forms a stop <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&Prime; with the one rim so as to delimit the pivoting movement of the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> schematic cross-section of the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown in the closed inking position with the sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> slipped thereover, wherein it is visible that the printing block <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime; contacts the ink pad <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, resulting in an inking of the stamp characters. The ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a hemiellipsoidal cross-section, whereby the sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, once it has been slipped on, can exert a pressure on the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to press it against the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Moreover, it is visible that the sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> completely encloses the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the ink pad <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the holding arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown in the open stamping position. After removing the sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> mounted on the holding arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> pivots into a horizontal position, cf. the arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, which is attained by an eccentrical arrangement of the gripping part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> on the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, whereby the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, when holding the stamping device in the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, simply pivots downwards on account of gravity until it arrests on stop <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&Prime;, as illustrated. In this horizontal position, the printing block <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime; may simply be pressed onto a substrate on account of its substantially perpendicular position relative to the holding arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Since it is spring-loaded, the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will pivot upwardly about the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so as not to impede the stamping procedure. This automatic outward pivoting of the ink pad support is attained by means of the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be returned into the closed inking position in a simple manner, by pressing with one finger each against the rear side <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the stamping plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and against the rear side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; of the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, whereby these two parts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are returned into their parallel, mutually abutting inking position. To fix it in the inking position, the sleeve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is slipped on until it snaps in over the bead <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprising an exchangeable rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is shown on which the forked carrying arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is attached in one piece. In doing so, also the rectangular depression <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; for accommodating an ink pad <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (cf. also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) is visible. Moreover, a slit-shaped recess <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&Prime; can be seen in the body of the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the forked carrying arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which serves to receive a leg of spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (cf. also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) which is designed as a leg spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</cross-reference>, rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; which is dovetail-shaped in cross-section can be seen in its inserted position in the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. To facilitate insertion of the rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; in the recess <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; has a slot <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in its starting region, whereby two resilient tongues <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are formed which can be pressed together so as to allow for an easier insertion in recess <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Moreover, rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> has beads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> on its head side which ensure an enhanced frictional engagement of rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; in recess <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; somewhat modified relative to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is shown in its inserted position in the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, wherein the rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; in its head region at the end of the two resilient tongues <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has latching hooks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which snap into an enlarged recess <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime; and thus axially secure the rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; in the recess <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. To exchange the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the two tongues <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> must be pressed towards each other so as to move the latching hooks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> out of the recess <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a schematic perspective sectional representation according to line XI-XI of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In this instance, the dovetail-shape of rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; can be seen which allows for a positive-fit or frictional connection between the recess <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the gap-shaped recess <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&Prime; in the vicinity of the carrying arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is visible which provides for a play of the carrying arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when inserting the rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. Also the frame-shaped recess <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for accommodating the ink pad <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) can be seen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> cross-section of the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with outward-pivoted ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is shown. The ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is slipped onto the rail <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;, whereby it can simply be exchanged in case of a lack of ink. In the sectional representation, also the leg spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be seen which is provided between the two fork arms of the carrying arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. By abutment of the one spring leg <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime;, which engages in the slit-shaped recess <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&Prime; (cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), the leg spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is wound up on the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and by abutment of the other spring leg <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&Prime; on handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> when the ink pad support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is pivoted into the inking position. Due to the relatively broad cross-sectional shape of the stamping device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the leg spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be housed between the two fork arms of the carrying arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> without any problems, whereas in case of thin stamping devices of round cross-section, a separate axle must be provided to accommodate the leg spring because of the narrow space available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> the long hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime; in the carrying arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is visible, which serves to compensate for different printing block thicknesses in the inking position (cf. also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
