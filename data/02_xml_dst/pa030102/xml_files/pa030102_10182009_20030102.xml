<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a ceramic heater and a resistor paste for the ceramic heater used in the fabrication process of semiconductor products. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a semiconductor fabricating process, for example, a silicon wafer is spin-coated with a resin and then is subjected to exposure and development processing before being postcured, and hence, it is necessary to heat the wafer. In addition, because CVD and plasma etching are carried out, it is necessary to heat the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For this reason, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 11-40330 proposes a heater in which a heating element is formed on a surface of a ceramic substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A substrate made of alumina has conventionally been used as the substrate for such a heater. Recently, however, much attention has been paid to the substrate made of aluminum nitride, which has superior electric insulation, high heat conductivity, and a low thermal expansion coefficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As a resistor paste used for providing a heating element on such an aluminum nitride material, a resistor paste has heretofore been known in which noble metal particles are mixed as a conductive material. Among the noble metals, silver is superior in heat resistance and superior in adhesive properties to aluminum nitride, so that in this respect, silver is considered to be a preferable material. However, if the resistor paste containing only silver is used, it has a disadvantage that the resistance of the resistor becomes low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, conventionally, platinum or palladium has been added to the paste, in addition to silver. However, because these noble metals are expensive, an oxide, such as a glass frit, is further added to the paste appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, if an oxide such as a glass frit is added, when the paste is baked the oxide reacts with aluminum nitride to release a large amount of a high-pressure nitrogen gas. Therefore, this fact poses a problem in that such a nitrogen gas causes the resistor to float above the aluminum nitride substrate, thereby reducing adhesive strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For example, the resistor for an aluminum nitride heater disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 4-300249 comprises one or more kinds of metal powders selected from the group consisting of platinum, palladium, silver, and gold, and the glass frit whose crystallization temperature is 700&deg; C. or higher (ZnO&mdash;B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-based glass or the like). Area resistivity of the resistor after baking is between at least 0.5&OHgr; per square and 10&OHgr; per square, and the resistor is bonded to the aluminum nitride substrate with an adhesive strength of 4.5 kgf/2 mm-square to 7.0 kgf/2 mm-square. However, also in the resistor that is disclosed in the above publication, it is assumed that the adhesive strength is reduced owing to the nitrogen gas. That is, it is difficult to state that the resistor is sufficiently bonded to the aluminum nitride substrate with an adhesive strength of about 4.5 kgf/2 mm-square to about 7.0 kgf/2 mm-square. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is a main object of the present invention to provide a ceramic heater in which a resistor is more firmly bonded to a nonoxide ceramic substrate, such as an aluminum nitride substrate or a silicon carbide substrate. A second object of the present invention is to provide a resistor paste for the ceramic heater which makes it possible to obtain by baking a resistor superior in adhesive strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The ceramic heater and the resistor paste for the ceramic heater that have been improved are provided o solve problems that have been described above and problems thereof in accordance with such objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have earnestly carried out research in order to solve such problems. As a result, they have found out that if ruthenium dioxide is mixed into at least two kinds of noble metal particles to make a paste, and the paste is baked onto the aluminum nitride substrate or the silicon carbide substrate, a resistor is formed that is superior in adhesive strength. The present inventors have completed the invention based on these findings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the present invention relates to a ceramic heater in which a register is provided on a ceramic substrate, wherein the resistor comprises ruthenium dioxide, a glass frit, and at least two kinds of noble metal particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention relates to a resistor paste for the ceramic heater that comprises noble metal particles, ruthenium dioxide, a glass frit, and an organic vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Generally, when a resistor paste containing an oxide such as a glass frit is sintered, for example, it causes a reaction of AlN&plus;PbO&rarr;alumina&plus;Pb&plus;N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&uarr;. However, addition of ruthenium dioxide to the AlN and PbO causes other reactions such as 2RuO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;2PbO&rarr;Ru<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Pb<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and 2RuO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rarr;Ru<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>. Therefore, it is considered that the generation of the nitrogen gas is inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a complex compound such as Ru<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Pb<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and Ru<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>comprising the ruthenium, glass frit, and oxygen exists in the interface between the aluminum nitride substrate and the resistor (metal sintered product), and is considered to have a function of complementing the adhesion of the two. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It has been confirmed that the adhesive strength of the resistor to the aluminum nitride substrate becomes about 14 kgf/2 mm-square to 17 kgf/2 mm-square by such complementation of the adhesive properties, which values are extremely large as compared with the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The similar reaction can also be recognized when the substrate material is changed to silicon carbide. That is, there occurs a reaction of SiC&plus;PbO (&plus;SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)&rarr;silica&plus;Pb&plus;CO&uarr;. However, the addition of ruthenium dioxide to the SiC and PbO (and SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) brings about other reactions, thereby inhibiting the generation of CO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as the present invention uses two or more kinds of noble metal particles, it is possible to increase the resistance of the resistor.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, a ceramic heater in an embodiment of the present invention will be described in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A resistor paste for the ceramic heater in the present embodiment comprises noble metal particles including silver or gold as the main component, and ruthenium dioxide, a glass frit and an organic vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As such noble metal particles, at least one kind or at least two kinds may be selected from silver particles, gold particles, platinum particles, and palladium particles. A mixture of the noble metal particles or alloy particles of the noble metals may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that an average particle diameter of the noble metal particles be in a range of about 0.1 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m. This is because if the average particle diameter is too small, the noble metal particles tend to be easily oxidized. It is also because if the average particle diameter is too large, the paste is difficult to sinter, and the resistance of a resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be obtained increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as the shape of the noble metal particles is not specifically limited, it is possible to use spherical particles, scaly particles, or a mixture of the spherical particles, scaly particles and the like. Among these, it is preferable to select scaly particles in view of good adhesive properties to aluminum nitride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As the noble metal particles to be contained in the paste, only one kind, that is, the silver particles may normally be used. In this case, it is advantageous in view of cost or the like. However, if it is not possible to obtain the desired resistance using only the silver particles, the noble metals other than silver, that is, the noble metal particles selected from the gold particles, platinum particles and palladium particles may be blended at an appropriate ratio. The blend ratio at this time may be decided appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In addition, a small quantity of base metal particles of nickel, copper, zinc, or the like may be mixed to such an extent as not to impair the effects of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Ruthenium dioxide reacts with the oxide contained in the paste to inhibit the generation of the nitrogen gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;ZnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-based glass, for example, may mainly be used as the glass frit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The composition of the glass frit is not particularly limited. For example, it is preferable to blend it in such ranges as 1 wt % to 30 wt % of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 5 wt % to 50 wt % of B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and 20 wt % to 70 wt % of ZnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>relative to the total amount of the frit. In addition to this may be appropriately mixed at least one material selected from oxides such as Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, PbO, CdO, Cr<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, CuO, Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or a bismuth single material and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the glass frit be amorphous. It is preferable that the glass softening point temperature of the glass frit be from 300&deg; C. to 650&deg; C. If this temperature is too low, it causes seeping when the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is baked, which causes an inter-pattern short. If the temperature is too high, it is not possible to have the sufficient adhesive strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In order to apply the mixture of the noble metal particles and the like onto a ceramic base material <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the organic vehicle functions to bring the mixture into a paste state. It is possible to use a known organic vehicle as the organic vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Such an organic vehicle is, for example, a vehicle comprising a resin binder, such as ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose or an acrylic resin, and a solvent such as &agr;-terpineol or butylcarbitol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A blend ratio of the respective materials that constitute the paste is not specifically limited. However, it is preferable that they are blended in a range of 55 wt % to 80 wt % of noble metal particles, 0.5 wt % to 10 wt % of ruthenium dioxide, 5 wt % to 20 wt % of the glass frit, 1 wt % to 10 wt % of the resin binder, and 10 wt % to 30 wt % of the solvent with respect to the total amount of the paste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the resistor paste regarding the present invention is applied into a predetermined shape onto one surface la of a disk-shaped ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (e.g., an outside surface of the substrate or an inside surface of the substrate) by an appropriate method such as a screen printing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The resistor paste is baked in a nitrogen atmosphere at about 700&deg; C. to about 900&deg; C., so that the resistor paste closely sticks to the ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As a result, a ceramic heater is produced in which a resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (heating element) is formed on the ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the surface of the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is preferably covered with a metal layer made of a non-oxidative metal, such as gold, silver, palladium, platinum, or nickel, so as to prevent the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from being oxidized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As the result of reaction between ruthenium dioxide and the oxide, a complex compound <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprising ruthenium, the glass frit, and oxygen at the interface is produced on the adhesion surface between the ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The intervention of the complex compound <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> allows the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be firmly bonded to the aluminum nitride substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> When the ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is, for example, the aluminum nitride substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, aluminum nitride reacts with an oxide in the glass frit to generate alumina. At this time, the aluminum nitride substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> partially dissolves, and alumina enters the concave portions formed by the dissolution. Therefore, this reaction itself basically contributes to the improvement of adhesive properties between the aluminum nitride substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, this reaction inconveniently generates a large amount of a nitrogen gas. For this reason, the nitrogen gas pushes up the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the inside, which leads to noticeable peeling of the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When the ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is, for example, the silicon carbide substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, silicon carbide and the oxide in the glass frit react to generate silica. At this time, the aluminum nitride substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> partially dissolves, and silica enters the concave portions formed by the dissolution. Therefore, this reaction itself basically contributes to the improvement of the adhesive properties between the silicon carbide substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, this reaction generates a large amount of carbon monoxide gas. In consequence, the carbon monoxide gas pushes up the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the inside, which leads to large-scale detachment of the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> in the same way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the addition of ruthenium oxide controls the above gas so that it is not generated in a large amount, thereby improving the adhesive properties between the ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It will hereafter be described in more detail by giving several more concrete Reference Examples and Comparative Example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> &lt;Preparation of Paste&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Noble metal particles, ruthenium dioxide, a glass frit, a resin binder (ethyl cellulose) and a solvent (a mixture of &agr;-terpineol:butylcarbitol&equals;2:8 (volume ratio)) are sufficiently kneaded to produce the resistor pastes of Reference Examples <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and Comparative Example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the respective pastes are as shown in Table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As the noble metal particles, those that have the average particle diameter of 4.5 &mgr;m and that are scaly were used. In Table, the compositions are indicated by weight ratio relative to the total amount of the pastes. Although the pastes of the respective Reference Examples are slightly different in their compositions, any of them is suitable to be used for a nonoxide ceramic, such as aluminum nitride or silicon carbide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> &lt;Production of Specimen&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> An alcohol was kneaded with 100 parts by weight of aluminum nitride powder (average particle diameter of 1.1 &mgr;m), 4 parts by weight of yttria (average particle diameter of 0.4 &mgr;m) and 12 parts by weight of an acrylic resin binder, and then granular powder was obtained by a spray-drier method. The granular powder was cast in a forming mold, and molded into a flat board shape so as to obtain a molding. In this molding, an insertion hole for inserting a semiconductor wafer supporting pin and a concave portion for embedding a thermoelectric couple were made by drill processing. Then, the molding was hot-pressed under conditions of approximately 1800&deg; C. and 200 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, whereby an aluminum nitride sintered product having a thickness of 3 mm was obtained. This sintered product was cut into a spherical shape having a diameter of 210 mm, and used as the aluminum nitride substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a disk-shaped heater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The pastes of Reference Examples <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and Comparative Example above were applied to the aluminum nitride substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the screen printing method such that the substrate may have the shape of the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Then, the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was baked in the nitrogen atmosphere and at 850&deg; C., and the pastes were baked onto it. An aluminum nitride heater <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> obtained in this way was used as the specimen for Reference Examples <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and Comparative Example. In Reference Examples <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and Comparative Example, the pastes that contain the most silver in the composition were used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, another specimen was produced in the following method: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> First, 0.5 parts by weight of carbon was added to 100 parts by weight of silicon carbide powder (average particle diameter of 1.1 &mgr;m) to be used as a starting material, and the molding was obtained in the above-mentioned manner. Then, the drill processing was applied to the molding before it was hot-pressed under the conditions of 1900&deg; C., 200 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, whereby a silicon carbide sintered product having a thickness of 3 mm was obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the glass paste was applied to the surface of the silicon carbide sintered product, and was heated at 800&deg; C., thereby forming a glass layer that played a role as an insulating layer on the surface of the silicon carbide sintered product. Next, the paste of Reference Example <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was screen-printed on the surface of the glass layer, and then the silicon carbide substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was baked in the nitrogen atmosphere and at 850&deg; C., and thus the silicon carbide heater <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of Reference Example <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was obtained. In Reference Example <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the paste that contains the most gold in the composition (concretely, Au&mdash;Pt paste) was used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In either of the specimens, the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> had a thickness of approximately 5 to 10 &mgr;m and a width of approximately 2.4 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> &lt;Test Example 1&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For each specimen, tensile strength of the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was measured. More concretely, the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is formed into a size of 2 mm-square was used as a test piece, and a 90-degree peeling test was carried out for each of the specimen. For the peeling test, &ldquo;autograph&rdquo; manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation was used. In this peeling test, a tension speed was set at 5 mm/minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> &lt;Test Example 2&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the area resistivity of the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was measured for each specimen. More concretely, the resistance of the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that was formed into a thickness of 1.0 &mgr;m, a width of 5 mm, and a length of 5 cm was measured by a multimeter, and the area resistivity was calculated on the basis of the measurement result. The results of the above respective tests are shown in Table <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the ceramic heater of the present invention, the resistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is very firmly bonded to the aluminum nitride substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the silicon carbide substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the ceramic heater is superior in durability and reliability, and its industrial utility value is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the resistor paste for the ceramic heater according to the present invention is baked onto the ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it is certainly possible to obtain the ceramic heater that has the above advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When the paste includes silver as the main component, it is possible to improve heat resistance and reduce material costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The embodiment and Examples that have so far been described are not intended to limit thereto. The present invention is not limited hereto, and may be improved within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
