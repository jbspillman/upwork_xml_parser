<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to rotors generally and, more particularly, but not by way of limitation. to a novel injection molded threaded rotor for linear actuator </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One type of linear actuator is constructed by providing a threaded rotor inside an electric motor A complementarily threaded leadscrew is inserted through the rotor and rotor rotation causes the leadscrew to selectively advance linearly in one direction or the other depending on the direction of rotation of the rotor. One family of electric motors used in such applications is the step motor or more specifically, the hybrid step motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The traditional method of manufacturing a threaded rotor is to machine the threaded rotor portion of the motor from a bearing type material, such as bronze. This is a very labor intensive and costly operation for a number of reasons, among which are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (1) Raw material is generally costly and there is a substantial amount of waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (2) Often, the thread form used is an acme thread and proper machining of the threads requires several operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (3) Materials that are good bearing materials do not necessarily machine easily, a good example being bronze. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition the process of machining these components produces parts that do not perform efficiently. due to the generally poor surface finish of cut threads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In other applications, it is common to use a thermoplastic material for the rotor, the thermoplastic material incorporating solid lubricants such as PTFE or silicone for increased efficiency Often, these parts use threads that are formed by injection molding This creates a more efficient thread form, due to the better surface finish Unfortunately the extension(s) of the threaded portion that create one or more bearing surfaces are not stable when formed of thermoplastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Consequently, it would be desirable to have a compound rotor that had the favorable characteristics of a thermoplastic threaded rotor, such as low coefficient of friction of the thermoplastic, with the stability of metal in the critical bearing journal area(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide a compound rotor for a linear actuator that has an injection molded thermoplastic threaded portion, but with one or more bearing journal areas formed of metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to provide such a compound rotor that can be easily and economically manufactured </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide such a compound rotor that can be produced in part, in an unscrewing mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Other objects of the present invention, as well as particular features, elements, and advantages thereof, will be elucidated in, or be apparent from, the following description and the accompanying drawing figures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Reference should now be made to the drawing figures on which similar or identical elements are given consistent identifying numerals throughout the various figures thereof, and on which parenthetical references to figure numbers direct the reader to the view(s) on which the element(s) being described is (are) best seen, although the element(s) may be seen on other figures also. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate a generally cylindrical shell/insert, constructed according to the present invention, and generally indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Shell/insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes first and second bearing areas <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and it will be understood that the first and second bearing areas will be journaled in bearings in the motor of which shell/insert becomes a part. It will also be understood that only one of bearing areas <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be provided and, thus, the present invention may be used in a motor having only one bearing structure. Shell/insert also includes a central portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, intermediate bearing areas <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and having therein four, axially extending, equally radially spaced slots <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (only one shown on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and two shown on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) defined through the wall thereof Slots <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provide retention and location features for an injection molded threaded portion, as will be seen with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. A fewer or greater number of slots may be provided within the contemplation of the present invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Shell/insert is machined from an easily machinable material such as brass using conventional machining techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a mold, generally indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and having first and second sections <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Shell/insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disposed in mold <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A locking core pin <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has been inserted into one end of shell/insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a threaded locking core pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> having a portion of its external surface threaded has been inserted into the other end of the shell/insert. A runner/gate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in communication with slots <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) has been used to inject a thermoplastic around and into shell/insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to form a threaded thermoplastic member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the shell/insert, the thread of threaded thermoplastic member formed on the inner surface of threaded thermoplastic member being complementary to the thread formed on the outer surface of threaded locking core pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the finished rotor. As is clearly indicated on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, slots <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> serve as retainers to prevent rotation between thermoplastic member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and shell/insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the manufacturing procedure, shell/insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is machined to produce that part (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>). Then, threaded locking core pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and locking core pin <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are inserted into shell/insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Next, shell/insert with core pins <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> disposed therein is inserted into second section <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of mold <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the second section and first section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are closed. Then, thermoplastic material is injected into mold <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through runner/gate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to form threaded thermoplastic member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> Next, mold <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is opened, shell/insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> removed, locking core pin <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> removed, and threaded locking core pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> manually or automatically unscrewed from the shell/insert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Locking core pin <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided to prevent thermoplastic material from running out around the end of threaded locking core pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Locking core pin <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and threaded locking core pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are interfitting to ensure proper alignment thereof The interfitting arrangement shown is a truncated, tapered pin formed on the proximal end of threaded locking core pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> inserted into a complementarily shaped channel formed in the proximal end of locking core pin <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, although other suitable arrangements may be provided as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments of the present invention described above, it will be recognized that individual elements and/or features thereof are not necessarily limited to a particular embodiment but, where applicable, are interchangeable and can be used in any selected embodiment even though such may not be specifically shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Terms such as &ldquo;upper&rdquo;, &ldquo;lower&rdquo;, &ldquo;inner&rdquo;, &ldquo;outer&rdquo;, &ldquo;inwardly&rdquo;, &ldquo;outwardly&rdquo;, &ldquo;vertical&rdquo;, &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;, and the like. when used herein, refer to the positions of the respective elements shown on the accompanying drawing figures and the present invention is not necessarily limited to such positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those elucidated in, or made apparent from, the preceding description, are efficiently attained and, since certain changes may be made in the above construction without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown on the accompanying drawing figures shall be interpreted as illustrative only and not in a limiting sense. </paragraph>
