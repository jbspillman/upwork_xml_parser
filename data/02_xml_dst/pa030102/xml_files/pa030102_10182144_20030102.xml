<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a recycled plastic article obtained by modifying a molded article formed from a collected plastic with an acrylic resin film. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For recycling, collected plastic articles are often re-pelletized and are used as a pile outdoors and the like. The reason for this is that, regarding plastics collected from domestic electric products, automobile parts, industrial parts and the like, tone in the case of recycling may be limited to dark color, generally, black and the like, since the plastic articles are colored in various tones, and have stains or are discolored caused by use, although the kinds of resins used therein can be recognized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, because of excellent transparency, acrylic resin films are used widely, while maintaining transparency or being with printing, coloration and the like, for modifying the surface of a molded article. The molded article coated with an acrylic resin film may include a molded article made from, for example, a polycarbonate resin, an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) resin, a polystyrene (PS) resin, a polypropylene (PP) resin and the like. Further, since acrylic resins are generally excellent in weather resistance, a method of coating a surface of polycarbonate resin sheet and the like is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Publication (JP-B) No. 47-19119 (&equals;U.S. Pat. No. 3,594,264), Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 55-59929 (&equals;GB 2,028,228), JP-A No. 4-270652 and the like. The acrylic resin film is required to have adhesion with a resin molded article to be coated, and is also required to maintain transparency of the acrylic resin even when colored. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have intensively studies on collection and recycle of plastics such as ABS resins, PS resins, olefin resins and acrylic resins which are widely used in domestic electric products, automobile parts or industrial parts and which show various tones, from the standpoint of global environment protection. As a result, the present inventors have found that, by modifying the surface of parts which are molded from collected plastics with a specific acrylic resin film, a surface-modified article may be obtained while maintaining transparency of acrylic resin film and having deep coloration, without being influenced by the colors of various collected parts. The present invention have accomplished based on the findings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Namely, the present invention provides a recycled plastic article obtained by modifying the surface of a molded article formed from a collected plastic with a colored film which comprises an acrylic resin containing an ultraviolet absorber and has a thickness of from 50 &mgr;m to 600 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The collected plastic for a recycled plastic article of the present invention may be a thermoplastic resin which is collected from domestic electric products, automobile parts, industrial parts and the like and is not particularly restricted. Examples thereof include styrene resins such as polystyrene, high impact polystyrene (HIPS), styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) resin, acrylonitrile-(ethylene-propylene rubber)-styrene (AES) resin, acrylonitrile-acrylic rubber-styrene (AAS) resin, and acrylonitrile-chlorinated polyethylehe-styrene (ACS) resin, ester resins such as polycarbonate, polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate, modified polyphenylene ether resins, acrylic resins such as methyl polymethacrylate, polyolefin resins and the like. Usually, ground materials of these collected plastics may be used for molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Preferable acrylic resin which is used as a film for coating a molded article formed from the collected plastics is, for example, an alkyl polymethacrylate, a copolymer of an alkyl methacrylate with an alkyl acrylate or the like. The copolymer, for example, preferably has 50% by weight to 99% by weight of alkyl methacrylates with 50% by weight to 1% by weight of alkyl acrylates are preferable. The copolymer may contain other monomers as copolymerization components as long as the objectives of the present invention are not deteriorated. Here, the alkyl methacrylate may be, for example, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate or the like. Particularly, methyl methacrylate is preferred. The alkyl acrylate may be, for example, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, octyl acrylate or the like. The number of carbon atoms in the alkyl of the alkyl acrylate may be in the range of from about 1 to 10, and is preferably 2 or more. The acrylic resins may be a general-purpose commercially available products. The acrylic resins may include a resin called impact-resistance acrylic resin. From the standpoint of weather resistance and chemical resistance, the resins containing no impact resistant acrylic resin are preferred as the surface layer. On the other hand, from the standpoint of the flexibility of a film thereof, it is preferred to use an impact resistant acrylic resin in a colored single layer film or in a coloration layer of a multi-layer film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is suitable that the acrylic resin used in the present invention has a glass transition temperature of from 40 to 110&deg; C. and has a weight-average molecular weight of from 70000 to 700000. The glass transition temperature can be measured by using a differential scanning calorimeter under a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature-raising rate of 10&deg; C./min. The weight-average molecular weight can be measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). When the glass transition temperature is too low, there is a tendency that a film having necessary surface hardness is not obtained. When the weight-average molecular weight is too small, since the melt viscosity of the polymer is too low and molding property in processing into film deteriorates, there is a tendency that it is difficult to control the thickness of the film precisely. On the other hand, when the weight-average molecular weight is too large, the melt viscosity of the polymer tends to be too high and molding property in processing into a film may deteriorate, and also there is a tendency of problems due to generation of extraneous materials in the form of gel in the resulting film. While generally the glass transition temperature of acrylic resins is roughly in the range of from 30&deg; C. to 110&deg; C., the acrylic resins having a relatively high glass transition temperature in the range of from 40&deg; C. to 110&deg; C. may be appropriately selected as the acrylic resin to be used in the present invention among general acrylic resins. Preferably, the acrylic resin has a glass transition temperature of 60&deg; C. or more, and of 106&deg; C. or less. Since the glass transition temperature of the acrylic resin is determined depending on the composition of monomers, the monomer composition may be appropriately selected so as to provide a glass transition temperature in the above-mentioned range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The polymer or copolymer may be used, as the acrylic resin, singly without modification, or the two or more polymers or copolymers may be used in admixture thereof. Particularly for raising the surface hardness of a film, it is advantageous to use a mixture containing at least one polymer or copolymer having a weight-average molecular weight in the range of from 70000 to 200000. Moreover, for simultaneously achieving improvement in surface hardness and improvement in molding property such as prevention of generation of unevenness in thermal molding after film formation, it is advantageous to use a mixture containing at least one component having a weight-average molecular weight in the range of from 70000 to 200000 and at least one component having a weight-average molecular weight in the range of from 150000 to 700000. In this case, the latter component may have a weight-average molecular weight in the range of from 150000 to 700000, provided that the molecular weight is larger than the weight-average molecular weight of the former component. When the molecular weight distribution by GPC of such a mixture is observed, a form having a spread skirt part or a form containing a shoulder part is found. The component having a weight-average molecular weight in the range of from 70000 to 200000 appropriately has a glass transition temperature in the range of from 90&deg; C. to 110&deg; C. The component having a weight-average molecular weight in the range of from 150000 to 700000 appropriately has a glass transition temperature in the range of from 40&deg; C. to 80&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is also advantageous to use a composition containing an impact-resistant acrylic resin which is an acrylic rubber particle having a single layer or multi-layer structure. Particularly, an acrylic polymer of multi-layer structure containing a rubber elastic layer is advantageous. The acrylic polymer may be an acrylic polymer having a multi-layer structure composed of at least two layers, and preferably of three layers. Such an acrylic polymer having a multi-layer structure may be, for example, an acrylic polymer of two-layer structure having an inner layer made of a rubber elastic body composed of a copolymer of an alkyl acrylate having 4 to 8 carbon atoms in the alkyl with a poly-functional monomer and with optional other mono-functional monomers and an outer layer made of a hard polymer composed of methyl methacrylate as the main component. Alternatively, the acrylic polymer having a multi-layer structure may be an acrylic polymer of three-layer structure having an innermost layer made of a hard polymer composed of methyl methacrylate as the main component, an intermediate layer made of a rubber elastic body composed of a copolymer of an alkyl acrylate having 4 to 8 carbon atoms in the alkyl with a poly-functional monomer and with optional other mono-functional monomers, and an outermost layer made of a hard polymer composed of methyl methacrylate as the main component. Among them, the latter one having a three-layer structure is preferred. The acrylic polymer having a multi-layer structure can be produced, for example, by methods described in JP-B No. 55-27576 (&equals;U.S. Pat. No. 3,793,402) and the like. The poly-functional monomer used herein is a compound having in the molecule thereof at least two polymerizable carbon-carbon double bonds, and may be, for example, alkenyl esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids such as allyl (meth)acrylate and methallyl (meth)acrylate, dialkenyl esters of di-basic acids such as diallyl maleate, unsaturated carboxylic acid diesters of glycols such as alkylene glycol di(meth)acrylates, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The mean particle size of the impact-resistant acrylic resin may be usually from 50 nm to 500 nm. The mean particle size is preferably 100 nm or more (and more preferably 250 nm or more) and is preferably 400 nm or less (and more preferably 350 nm or less). When the particle size is too small, the resulting film tends to have lowered impact resistant. When the particle size is too large, the resulting film tends to have lowered transparency. The impact-resistant acrylic resin composition can be easily produced, for example, by kneading an acrylic resin with an impact-resistant acrylic resin containing a rubber elastic layer. The composition may also contain other components for polymer as long as the objectives of the present invention are not deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The acrylic resin composition is excellent in a property of molding into a film, and can be easily molded into a film by, for example, extrusion casting with a chilled roll, extrusion molding method in which a film is molded while keeping the both surfaces of the film in contact with the surfaces of rolls, belt cooling extrusion method in which a film is molded while keeping the both surfaces of the film in contact with the surfaces of metal belts, inflation extrusion molding method, solvent casting method or the like. Further, in molding of a general film, a screen mesh made of metals, sintered ceramics or the like may be placed on the passage of a melted resin for the purpose of preventing extraneous materials from being contaminated. In this method, however, when a fine mesh is used, the mesh may be clogged immediately and, therefore, a production line should be stopped frequently and clogged materials should be removed, in some cases. In such a case, by using a rotary-type screen changer (for example, a screen changer manufactured by Gnois, GE or the like), a film with no extraneous materials having a size of 100 &mgr;m or less can be produced without stopping the production line, which such materials having bad influences on optical ability or printing property of the film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus-obtained film is, due to its sufficient thickness precision, surface smoothness, surface hardness and excellent molding processability, desirable from the standpoints of decrease in outer haze and prevention of print omission, that is a printing property of design. Therefore, the film is optimally utilized in a simultaneous injection method and a surface coating method. Particularly, it is preferred, from the standpoints of the thickness precision and surface smoothness of a film, that molding is conducted in a method of keeping the both surfaces of a film product obtained by melt extrusion molding in contact simultaneously with the surfaces of metal rolls or the surfaces of metal belts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The thus-obtained film may have design printed on one surface thereof, or may have coating for adhesion or for being antistatic on the outermost layer thereof. Further, the film may be a film which is previously shaped by performing thermal molding (such as vacuum molding) and which is utilized in a simultaneous injection method. Furthermore, it is possible for the film to have a structure containing backing with a film or sheet that is made of other resins, for example, other acrylic resins, vinyl chloride resins, transparent ABS resins, polycarbonate resins, polyolefin resins and the like. Particularly, a multi-layer film combining a colored acrylic resin with a transparent acrylic resin is effective as automobile exterior plates such as bumpers, garnishes and side moles or painting substitution in domestic electric products, due to the color depth of a coloration layer that is viewed through a transparent layer, and due to features such as the weather resistance and surface hardness of acrylic resin. For film molding processing of such a film, it is preferably to conduct a multi-layer film molding method by a multi-layer extrusion method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the multi-layer film, a combination of films by changing an acrylic resin composition is possible, and alternatively, a surface layer made of a general-purpose acrylic resin containing no rubber elastic body may be provided as a surface layer of a film made of acrylic resin composition containing a rubber elastic body. When the multi-layer film having a transparent layer made of a general-purpose acrylic resin is used, the resulting film can have a surface pencil hardness of 2H. When a transparent acrylic resin is used as a surface layer, the transparent acrylic resin preferably has a weight-average molecular weight in the range of from 70000 to 600000. More preferably, the weight-average molecular weight is 120000 or more, and is 300000 or less. Further, the transparent acrylic resin preferably has a glass transition temperature of 60&deg; C. to 110&deg; C. More preferably, the glass transition temperature is 75&deg; C. or more, and is 106&deg; C. or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The thickness of a film used in the present invention is in the range of from 50 &mgr;m to 600 &mgr;m, and is preferably in the range of from about 100 &mgr;m to 600 &mgr;m. When a recycled plastic article of the present invention is produced industrially, a method of feeding a film continuously is desirable. Therefore, when the thickness of a film is over 600 &mgr;m, the film cannot be wound in the form of continuous roll, undesirably. Further, when a film is fed continuously, a film thickness of from 100 &mgr;m to 300 &mgr;m is preferred from the standpoints of decrease in winding weight and of shaping property in vacuum molding. When the film thickness is over 300 &mgr;m, it is advantageous to feed the film into a mold, in each piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> When the article of the present invention is produced by a simultaneous injection method, the resin which is melt-injected in a mold can be selected from various thermoplastic resins which are collected from domestic electric products, automobile parts, industrial parts and the like, as described above. Use of a resin composition containing acrylic resins in an amount of 10% by weigh or less in the resins to be melt-injected is advantageous since close adherence with a film increases. The simultaneous injection method can be conducted, for example, in accordance with a method which is described in JP-B Nos. 63-6339 (&equals;U.S. Pat. No. 4,545,752), 4-9647, and JP-A No. 7-9484 or the like. Namely, a negative mold and a positive mold forming a cavity space are opened, a film is inserted between the both molds, the both molds are closed sandwiching the film and are clamped, a melted thermoplastic resin is injected from a gate, is filled in the cavity and is solidified by cooling, to adhere the film integratedly with the surface of the injected molded body, and then, the both molds are opened. A laminated molded article can be thus obtained. The conditions of injection molding such as resin temperature and injection pressure are set at appropriate values in view of the kind of injected resin and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the surface of a molded article formed from collected plastics is modified with a colored film which comprises an acrylic resin containing an ultraviolet absorber. The ultraviolet absorber may be the same kind of absorber as usually added to acrylic resin. Specifically, the ultraviolet absorber may be benzotriazole ultraviolet absorbers, benzophenone ultraviolet absorbers or the like, which may be used each alone or in combination of two or more. From the standpoints of reduction in volatile amounts of absorber from a film and prevention of deterioration of a ground layer, a benzotriazole ultraviolet absorber having a large molecular weight is preferred. The suitable benzotriazole ultraviolet absorber may include, for example, 2,2&prime;-methylenebis&lsqb;6-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol&rsqb;, 2-&lsqb;2-hydroxy-3-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimidemethyl)-5-methylphenyl&rsqb;benzotriazole or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When a colored film having a single-layer structure is used, an ultraviolet absorber may be present in it. When a multi-layer film is used, it is preferred to allow an ultraviolet absorber to be contained in an acrylic resin of the first layer (surface layer). By thus allowing an ultraviolet absorber to be contained in the surface layer, discoloration of a second or a subsequent layer, which of which may contain a coloration layer, can be suppressed. The amount of an ultraviolet absorber to be used may be usually from about 0.1% by weight to 2% by weight, per the amount of acrylic resin which constitutes a single-layer film or a surface layer of a multi-layer film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The acrylic resin composition constituting a film may additionally contain usual additives. The additives may be, for example, hindered phenol antioxidants, phosphorus antioxidants, sulfur antioxidants, weather-proofing agents such as hindered amine-based light stabilizers, flame retardants, coloring agents, pigments, inorganic fillers and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the case of using a single layer film, the film itself may have the above-mentioned thickness. In the case of using a multi-layer film, the surface layer preferably has a thickness of about 50 &mgr;m to about 200 &mgr;m. When the thickness is less than 50 &mgr;m, the transparent depth of an acrylic resin film tends to deteriorate, possibilities may increase such that an ultraviolet ray easily permeate, which results in insufficient suppression in discoloration of a second layer containing a coloration layer increases. More preferably, the thickness is 80 &mgr;m or more. When the thickness of the surface layer is over 200 &mgr;m, the impact resistance of the resulting film is decreased. The thickness of the surface layer is preferably 150 &mgr;m or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Resins containing acrylic resins and acrylic rubbers in admixture thereof are commercially available and can be used. Such commercially available resins may include, for example, &ldquo;(trade name) Oroglass DR&rdquo; manufactured by Atohaas, &ldquo;(trade name) Sumipex HT&rdquo; manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd and the like. The amount of acrylic rubber particles in the impact resistant acrylic resin may be usually from 5% by weight to 50% by weight per the amount of the acrylic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the case of using a multi-layer film, the coloration layer preferably has a thickness in the range of from about 150 &mgr;m to about 400 &mgr;m. When the thickness is less than 150 &mgr;m, color see-through tends to be remarkable due to decrease in thickness after vacuum molding, and therefore, the thickness is more preferably 200 &mgr;m or more. When the thickness is over 400 &mgr;m, cost tends to increase more than necessity. For coloration of a film, for example, the acrylic resin constituting the film may contain a coloring agent such as dye and pigment. The dye and pigment are selected and used appropriately depending on the intended color. The content of the coloring agent, which is contained in a resin composition constituting a coloration layer, may be usually about 1% by weight to about 20% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The coloration may be conducted using a metal powder to obtain a metallic color. A flat metal powder such as a flat aluminum fragment is preferably used as the metal powder. By containing a mica which is subjected to a surface treatment and the like, a pearl-like color can also be provided. In the case of using a metal powder, a mica and the like, the amount thereof may be about 1% by weight to about 10% by weight in a resin composition constituting a colored film. The metal powder, mica and the like may be used together with the above-mentioned coloring agent, or may be used each singly. When a metal powder, mica or the like is used together with a coloring agent, an acrylic resin film which shows a metallic or pearl-like tone and is colored can be obtained. When a metal powder is used singly, a metallic color having a tone corresponding to the kind of the used metal is obtained. Specifically, when an aluminum fragment is used singly, a silver metallic color is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Onto an acrylic resin film used in the present invention, an adhesive backing layer may be laminated at the side of contact with a molded article formed from a collected plastic. In this case, the thickness of the adhesive backing layer may be appropriately 150 &mgr;m or more. By lamination of such a backing layer, adhesion may be raised between a collected polyolefin resin and the like with an acrylic resin, while the collected polyolefin resin and the like originally has poor adhesion with the acrylic resin. Also, the lamination of the backing layer may avoid see-through looking of the color of the collected molded resin through the acrylic resin film, or may make contrast of color excellent. When a backing layer is provided onto a multi-layer film, it is advantageous to place a transparent acrylic resin containing an ultraviolet absorber as a surface layer, an acrylic resin which is non-transparently colored as a second layer below the surface layer, and a backing layer as a third layer below the second layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, when physical properties which are typically represented by impact resistance are satisfied, a collected plastic can be used as it is. However, since physical properties generally decrease, it is preferred to add and mix a physical-property improving and reinforcing agent in/with the collected plastic in an amount of 0.01% by weight to 30% by weight. More preferably, the physical-property improving and reinforcing agent is mixed in an amount of 1% by weight to 30% by weight. By mixing the physical-property improving and reinforcing agent as described above, the recycling frequency of a collected plastic increases steeply, and repeated collection recycle becomes possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The physical-property improving and reinforcing agent referred to herein is a chemical agent which is added to a plastic for improving physical properties, particularly strength, of a plastic product. The physical-property improving and reinforcing agent may include various kinds of elastomer, rubber, graft copolymer and the like. The elastomer includes thermoplastic elastomer such as polyester elastomer, polyurethane elastomer and polyamide elastomer. The rubber includes diene rubber such as polybutadiene rubber, butadiene-styrene copolymer rubber, butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, isoprene rubber and chloroprene rubber, ethylene-butene copolymer rubber, ethylene-propylene rubber such as ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber and ethylene-propylene-nonconjugated diene copolymer rubber, acrylic rubber, silicone rubbers and the like. The graft polymer includes those obtained by polymerizing the above rubbers with vinyl monomers. Among them, a graft polymer obtained by polymerizing rubber with at least an aromatic vinyl monomer is preferred. In this case, a graft polymer obtained by polymerizing vinyl cyanide monomer together with an aromatic vinyl monomer is also advantageous. The physical-property improving and reinforcing agent is used particularly advantageously when a collected plastic is the above-mentioned styrene resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The rubber constituting a graft polymer, which is a physical-property improving and reinforcing agent, may include those described above, and is preferably diene rubber such as polybutadiene and butadiene-styrene copolymer rubber, ethylene-propylene rubber and ethylene-propylene-non-conjugated diene copolymer rubber which is obtained by introducing a non-conjugated diene component (such as ethylidene norbornene, dicyclopentadiene and 1,4-hexadiene) as a third component into ethylene-propylene rubber. More preferable examples may include ethylene-propylene-non-conjugated diene copolymer rubber having an ethylene content of 30% by weight to 80% by weight and a Mooney viscosity (which is represented by (ML(1&plus;4)121&deg; C.&rsqb;) in the range of 40 to 80. The aromatic vinyl monomer may include styrene, &agr;-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene, bromostyrene and the like, which may be used each alone or in combination of two or more. Among them, styrene and &agr;-methylstyrene are preferred. The vinyl cyanide monomer may include acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and the like which may be used each alone or in combination if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A part of aromatic vinyl monomers constituting the above-mentioned graft polymer can also be substituted by other monomers which are copolymerizable therewith. Such monomers may include (meth)acrylic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and methyl acrylate, maleimide monomers such as N-phenylmaleimide and N-cyclohexylmaleimide, unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid and fumaric acid, which may be used each alone or in combination of two or more. </paragraph>
