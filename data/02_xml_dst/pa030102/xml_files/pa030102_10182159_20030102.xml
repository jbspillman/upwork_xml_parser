<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an example of configuration of a communication system to which the present invention is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A base station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a communication antenna <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and can thereby communicate by radio with each of a display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A provided with a communication antenna <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, a display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B provided with a communication antenna <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B, and a display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C provided with a communication antenna <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C. (When each of the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C does not need to be individually differentiated from the others, the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C will hereinafter be referred to collectively as a display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The same applies to other constituent parts.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The base station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected with a television broadcast receiving antenna <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, in response to a specification by a user of a channel to be selected, the base station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can extract a program signal from television broadcast waves received by the television broadcast receiving antenna <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The extracted program signal is compressed by a compression method conforming to MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for example, transmitted from the communication antenna <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and then outputted to a display unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and speakers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided to the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The user can thereby view the television program while holding the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and moving freely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The base station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also connected with the Internet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> formed by a public line network and the like. Thus, in response to notification from the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the communication antenna <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) inputted by the user, the base station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> accesses a not shown WWW (World Wide Web) server connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and specified by the URL, and thereby obtains a Web page described in HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), for example. The obtained Web page is compressed by a predetermined compression method, transmitted from the communication antenna <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and then displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The user can thereby use various contents on the Internet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by means of the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> while moving freely, as in the case of viewing the television program. The user can also use the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to send and receive e-mail to and from an information processing apparatus such as a personal computer connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Each of the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with a memory card slot <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> so that a removable memory card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the memory card slot <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The memory card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a nonvolatile flash memory therein, and can store various information. The user can for example store a picture taken by a digital camera on the memory card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, insert the memory card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the memory card slot <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and thereby display the taken picture on the display unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The user can also store on the memory card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a desired moment of a program displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and later reproduce the moment on the display unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In addition, the user can use the memory card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to install various programs stored thereon in the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. For example, the user can use an upgrade program stored on the memory card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a control program compatible with various data currently used in the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to upgrade a WWW browser program or the like stored in the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> When the series of processing steps is to be carried out by software, a program forming the software is installed from a network or a recording medium into a general-purpose personal computer <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, for example, and provided to the base station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the display apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the memory card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the like. The program may be installed in the base station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> directly from the Internet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as a network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the recording medium is not only formed by packaged media distributed to users to provide the program separately from the apparatus proper, the packaged media being formed by a magnetic disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (including a floppy disk), an optical disk <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (including CD-ROM (Compact Disk-Read Only Memory) and DVD (Digital Versatile Disk)), a magneto-optical disk <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> (including MD (Mini-Disk)), the memory card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the like having the program recorded thereon, but also formed by a ROM <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, a hard disk included in a storage unit <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> or the like which has the program recorded thereon and is supplied to the user in a state of being preincorporated in the apparatus proper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that in the present specification, the steps describing the program recorded on the recording medium include not only processing carried out in time series in the described order but also processing carried out in parallel or individually and not necessarily in time series. </paragraph>
