<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a connection device for a fluid line, comprising a connection unit having a sleeve-like insert body fitted by being plugged in a socket in a metallic holding body, anchoring means, constituted by one or more projections, being provided on the outer periphery of the insert body for anchoring in the socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Connection devices of this type, as described for example in the European patent publication 0 723 103 B1, are utilized to be able to connect fluid lines with fluid power equipment such as a valve or drive or the like. In the case of the connection device in accordance with the said European patent publication 0 723 103 B1 a connection unit is provided, whose component in the form of an insert body is inserted into the socket of a holding body and anchored in this socket. The holding body is in this case directly designed in the form of a component of the fluid power equipment, fitting by plugging taking place so that projection-like anchoring means provided on the outer periphery of the insert body bite into the wall of the socket and produce an interlocking connection so that the insert body is held immovably in the socket in the axial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Connection devices of this type do possess the advantage that during fitting the connection unit it is possible to do without any screwing operation. On the other hand it has however turned out that firm holding of the insert body in the holding bodies of metal&mdash;for example of injection cast aluminum&mdash;can not be ensured under all states in a reliable manner, because the anchoring means constituted by one or more projections are subject to such deformation on biting into the hard material of the holding body or are even shorn off, that same are unable to perform the anchoring function or not perform it to the required degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly one object of the present invention is to provide a connection device of the type initially mentioned which ensures firm anchoring, even in the case of a holding body consisting of metal, in the socket after fitting therein by plugging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve such aim the connection device comprises a retaining ring of synthetic resin material, which is fixed in an annular groove, provided at the inner periphery of the socket, of the holding body, so that same may bear axially in either direction in relation to the holding body, the insert body being inserted coaxially into the retaining ring and having its anchoring means biting into the synthetic resin material of the holding ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This means that conditions are created in the socket of the metallic holding body as regards the anchoring measures which are comparable with those in the case of a holding body consisting of synthetic resin material, the insert body not having its anchoring means biting into the pertinent hard material of the metallic holding body but rather into the softer synthetic resin material of the retaining ring placed in the socket. The retaining ring itself is so axially locked on the holding body that it can bear in either axial direction on the holding body, something which ensures a firm retention of the insert body both in the case of regular fitting by plugging as part a press fitting and also in the case of later tension loading. The insert body is indirectly anchored, that is to say by the intermediary of the retaining ring of synthetic resin material, on the metallic holding body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further advantage produced with the design in accordance with the invention is that in the case of pulsating internal pressure loading normally occurring during operation, the resulting varying axial loading is taken up by the toothed engagement between the anchoring means and the retaining ring, the retaining ring being able, given a suitable design, to bear over a large area on the holding body. This means that shearing off and detachment at the point of anchoring engagement, as occurs in the prior art, is prevented when the anchoring means of the insert body directly cooperate with the metallic surface of the holding body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further advantageous developments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The anchoring means provided on the insert body preferably consist of metal and may be designed in the form of a direct one-piece component of the insert body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The anchoring means may for instance comprise a plurality of annular projections placed in sequence with an axial distance between them, which are more especially arranged respectively concentrically in relation to insert body and have a toothed shape. However, as has turned out, optimum anchoring engagement is ensured if the anchoring means biting into the holding body only consist of one annular radial projection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The desired reliable anchoring of the retaining ring in the socket of the holding body may be ensured in a particularly simple manner if the retaining ring is set in an annular groove whose axially facing flanks are opposite to the axial end sides of the retaining ring so that the retaining ring may bear against same. It is in this manner that a particularly simple possibility is provided of holding the retaining ring only by frictional engagement at the flanks of the annular groove and without additional attachment measures such as bonding or press fitting or the like in the socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The fitting of the retaining ring in place is particularly simple if it is slotted at one point of its periphery so that it may be compressed elastically for insertion into the annular groove temporarily with a reduction of its external cross section. The retaining ring may for instance be inserted in the compressed state, it then expanding again on reaching the annular groove automatically and snapping into the annular groove. This fitting operation may be facilitated by providing a small degree of play between the retaining ring and the annular groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As a material for the retaining ring the use of an elastomeric material is recommended, particularly satisfactory results having been obtained with polyoxymethylene (POM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An other particularly advantageous measure is such that the inner diameter of the outer section, to the fore of the retaining ring in the axial direction, of the socket is made larger than the inner diameter of the retaining ring in the fitted state, this being in conjunction with a further setting of the diameter such that the inner diameter of the above mentioned preceding outer section of the socket is the same as the outer diameter, defined by the anchoring means, of the insert body or preferably is somewhat larger than it. This means that during fitting by plugging of the insert body an excessively high load of the anchoring means owing to possible contact with the hard material of the holding body is prevented, it even being possible to prevent contact completely, something which reduces, or even completely excludes the danger of shearing off the anchoring means on press fitting the insert body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> For fixing the fluid line, which is to be connected, it is possible to provide holding means at the inner periphery of the insert body, for instance in the form of resiliently elastically movable claw elements, which after insertion of the fluid duct may act on the outer periphery thereof. A design which is advantageous in this case is such that the claw elements are designed as a component of an annular body attached to the insert body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is furthermore possible to provide a release body which is able to be moved more particularly axially, using which body it is possible to so act so manually on the holding means oppositely that same perform a release movement in the radially outward direction in order to release a previously inserted fluid duct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Although it is in principle possible to design the connection device generally as a separate component group, which is then installed at the intended site of application, particular advantages are to be had more particularly if the holding body of the connection device is directly constituted by a component of a fluid power device, as for instance by the housing of such equipment.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a part of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of fluid power equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of unspecified type, as for example of a valve or a drive operated by fluid power or some other means, which is operated in conjunction with a hydraulic or preferably a pneumatic pressure medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> At least one cylindrical and possibly multiply stepped socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed in the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such socket having its outer terminal portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> open toward an outer face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which outer face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is constituted in the working embodiment by the terminal face of a collar-like projection of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The inner terminal region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, placed further to the inside, of the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> merges with a fluid duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, leading to other equipment, in the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This fluid duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> leads for instance, in the case of a fluid power device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constituted by a valve, to a valve chamber, which is provided with a valve member, not illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> represents a holding body, which in the following will be referenced <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, for a connection unit generally referenced <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, together with which it defines a connection device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which then renders possible the preferably detachable connection of a fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> indicated in chained lines. This means that a fluid connection may be produced between the fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which may as necessary be rigid or flexible, and the fluid duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The connection of the fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the working example performed extremely simply by coaxial insertion into the connection unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, by which it is held releaseably in the inserted state. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> this inserted state of the fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and furthermore the wall delimiting the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, are in the working example metallic and are more particularly of an injection cast aluminum material of the desired configuration, that is to say a material which is extremely frequently employed in fluid power equipment for the housings. Using such material and methods of forming it is possible to produce optimum configurations with the simultaneous provision of a relatively high strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The connection unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a sleeve-like insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having an axial passage <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and which is locked on assembly by plugging in the direction <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> indicated by the arrow, in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. During fitting by plugging the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pressed into place by the application of a certain fitting force coaxially as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> axially from the outside into the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the condition with the connection unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mounted on the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> the inser5t body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably fr its full axial length in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and its end more particularly flush with the above mentioned outer face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> At its radially aligned outer periphery the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> possesses anchoring means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> constituted by one or more radially outwardly extending projections, by means of which it is so held in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a toothed biting effect that falling out of the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is prevented. In the working embodiment illustrated the anchoring means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprise an annular anchoring projection <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is concentric in relation to the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and which has a sawtooth-like configuration, and which is adjoined axially on either side by cylindrical sections of the outer peripheral face <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, in relation to which it pprojects radially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the case of an embodiment, which is not illustrated in detail, a plurality of mutually coaxial annular anchoring projections are provided, which are arranged at an axial distance apart. However, it has turned out that a sufficient holding effect may be produced even with only one anchoring projection <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is in the present working example a metallic body and preferably consists of brass material. The anchoring means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are best an integral part of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and accordingly consist in the working example of metal as well, something which permits the transmission of substantial tension forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The anchoring of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is performed not by direct cooperation with the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, but rather by the intermediate arrangement of an additional component in the form of a retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> consisting of synthetic resin material. This retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is arranged coaxially in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and is locked in an annular groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the inner periphery of the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The annular groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> possesses one radially inwardly facing cylindrical groove floor face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and two groove flanks <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> facing each other axially and defining the lateral limit of the groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The groove flank, which is further to the outside in the axial direction in relation to the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, will in the following be termed the outer groove flank <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, whereas the groove flank, which is further inward and is aligned axially in the outer direction, will be termed the inner groove flank <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which preferably has a rectangular cross section, has its radially outwardly turned section seated in the annular groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, its two oppositely directed axial terminal faces <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> respectively facing one of the outer and, respectively, inner groove face <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This means that the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is prevented from moving to any substantial degree in relation to the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and it is held in place by a virtual interlocking contact on the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the axial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> However in the working embodiment this feature means a slight degree of axial play, which is to be attributed to the manner of fitting of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thus the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the working example is not molded in the annular groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as would be possible in principle, for instance during injection molding. In fact the fitting of the retaining ring in place in the prefabricated state thereof in the fitting direction <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is from the outside by snapping in place or by a detent action in the annular groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure that the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be moved through the outer section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, (coming axially in front toward the outer side of the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) of the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&mdash;the diameter of this outer section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is smaller than that of the groove&apos;s floor face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&mdash;the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is slotted at one point of its periphery as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The width of the radially and axially continuously extending slot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is so selected that the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> during fitting may be so compressed by the application of radial force temporarily, with a reduction in its outer periphery or, respectively, outer cross section, that it fits through the outer section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> after deformation in this fashion is fitted in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it will expand again owing to the elasticity of its material with a renewed enlargement of the width <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the slot of its own accord so that it snap-fits into the annular groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with a radial overlapping of the groove flanks <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The elastically resilient properties in the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be ensured without any trouble if the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is manufactured of an elastomeric synthetic resin material, and more particularly of polyoxymethylene synthetic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the state fitted in the annular groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will project some distance proud of the inner peripheral face of the outer section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> radially outward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The fitting by plugging of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is performed after preceding fitting of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the annular groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. For, this the outer periphery of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably so matched to the inner periphery of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that a certain force is necessary for assembly by plugging, because the retaining ring is braced between the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This means that there is a radially play-free seating of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> During fitting by plugging of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> the anchoring means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> too are introduced into the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Since they project beyond the outer peripheral face <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in face to face contact with the inner peripheral face of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, they fit into the synthetic resin material of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a radially outward direction with an interlocki. The result is hence the effect of toothed engagement or bite, preventing the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> being pulled out of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a direction opposite to the fitting direction <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The tension forces transmitted by way of anchoring means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are ultimately taken up by the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, against which the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may bear axially. The supporting effect at the two groove flanks <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is then effective in both axial directions so that the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is not only held by the interlocking effect from being pulled out of the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, but also its axial depth of fitting is limited and it is held in the axial position, when the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is press fitted coaxially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Since the anchoring means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provided on the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> only bite into the synthetic resin material of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and do not cooperate with the harder metallic material of the holding body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, it is possible to ensure that even in the case of pulsating pressure action in the fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and hence accompanying small axial relative movements between the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the holding body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> the desired bite or toothed engagement is maintained and pulling out is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Although it would in principle be possible to attach the retaining ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by bonding for instance or by some other measures frictionally additionally in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it is possible to do without such measures in the embodiment of the invention, something greatly simplifying assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A further advantageous aspect results from the fact that the inner diameter d<highlight><subscript>I </subscript></highlight>of the outer section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, axially to the front of the annular groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, of the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is not smaller than the outer diameter d<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, defined by the anchoring means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is convenient for the inner diameter d<highlight><subscript>I </subscript></highlight>to be larger than the above mentioned outer diameter d<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>so that on insertion of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> it is possible to certainly exclude contact of the anchoring means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with the metallic parts of the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, such metallic part being in front of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This means that accidental shearing off of the anchoring means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is prevented, such anchoring means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> generally being weaker owing to the selection of the material of same than the material of the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The connection unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can have its insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> directly and without the above noted holding ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> fitted in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a holding body consisting of synthetic resin material. For fitting the connection unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> made of metal it is sufficient to fit the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the above mentioned manner with a retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> manufactured of synthetic resin material, the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> then providing for conditions at the contact point with the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comparable to a synthetic resin holding body so that the connection unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is suitable for fitting in a synthetic resin holding body or in a metal holding body as may be desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> For holding the inserted fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the connection unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> the latter is provided with holding means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at the inner periphery of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Such holding means are in the working example constituted by resiliently elastic claw elements which are fixed to the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> though able to move in relation to the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such elements being designed in the form of a component of an annular body <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, preferably consisting entirely of metal, which is held at an outer ring section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in a recess in the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or is held in some other fashion on the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The holding means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are bent outward out of the principal plane <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of extent, indicated in chained lines, of the body <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the direction <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of fitting and extend toward their free end obliquely radially inward and simultaneously in the fitting direction <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Their free ends define an inner diameter of the ring body <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which, considered when fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is not inserted, is smaller than the outer diameter of such fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be connected is introduced from the manipulating side <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, associated with outer axial terminal portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in the fitting direction <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> into the connection unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At that time its terminal side touches the oblique rear side, facing against the direction <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of fitting, of the holding means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are then pivoted radially outwardly so that the fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is able to be inserted through the ring body <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Owing to the resilient return force of the holding means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> the fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is then acted upon at its outer periphery by the holding means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with a sprag-like or claw-like action and is held. In this respect the free ends of the holding means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may engage the fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in an interlocking manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In those cases, as in the present working example, in which the removal as required of a previously connected fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is to be made possible, the connection unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided with a release body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Same has a sleeve-like actuating section <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> extending from the manipulation side <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> into the axial passage <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. By way of contact with the actuating section <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> the release body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> slides on the inner periphery of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> axially. A handle section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> connected with the actuating section <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and for instance shaped like a flange, is located clear of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is placed to the fore of same toward the manipulating side <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The release body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> possesses a coaxial opening <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> which has a fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extending through it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The release body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> runs into the interior of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as far as the rear side of the holding means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. For removal of the fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> actuating force is applied manually on the manipulating section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the same direction as the fitting direction <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> so that the release body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is moved forward in the fitting direction <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, it acting to the rear on the holding means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> causing same to perform an outward radial pivotal movement, termed a release movement. The holding means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> thus come out of engagement with the wall of the fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which can therefore be pulled out of the connection unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is convenient for the release body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to be tethered to the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to prevent loss thereof. This is ensured for instance by providing one or more radially outward directed radial projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which may hook onto a step <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> on the inner periphery of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The insertion force necessary for pressing the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or, respectively, the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may in the working example be applied to the manipulating section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the release body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The latter is then initially inserted some distance into the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> until it contacts a support face <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the opposite terminal face <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that the pressing force is transmitted to the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The depth of insertion of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can for example be limited by an abutment collar <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> provided on the axially outer end of the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and projecting radially past the outer peripheral face <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which collar <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on reaching the intended depth of fitting engages the axially outwardly facing terminal face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the section, which projects radially inward past the annular groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Finally the connection device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is furthermore provided with a sealing means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, which is for instance constituted by a single integral seal, said means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> having a double function since on the one hand it seals on the holding body <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and on the other hand it seals on the inserted fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. It is located preferably at a point placed axially and inwardly coaxially in relation to the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the interior of socket <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The inserted fluid line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> runs through the sealing means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. While the sealing means <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the working embodiment is a separate component, it will be clear that it could also be designed in manner united with the insert body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
