<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to computer systems, and more specifically, to an apparatus and method for accessing multimedia content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Companies are continuously searching for new ways of advertising and promoting their products. Many conventional marketers, mainly those for children, distribute tokens and giveaways (i.e., premiums) in an attempt to attract consumers&apos; attention. In many cases, the tokens have no significant entertainment, educational, or informative value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW), in addition to the recent advances in personal computer (PC) technology have transformed the WWW into a viable advertising and promotion mechanism. For example, advertising and promotional materials in the form of multimedia content is made available to consumers and potential consumers on the Internet. Devices such as, by way of example, PCs, televisions (TVs), digital TVs, Web TVs, and other types of post-PC digital appliances capable of connecting to the Internet are used to access the source of information. These devices typically provide a user interface, including input/output devices (i.e., keyboard, mouse, display, etc.) used to interact with the user interface, that allows its user to navigate to and obtain the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, conventional user interfaces and the input/output devices are not suitable for all users. A considerable number of users may experience problems in working with these devices. These conventional user interfaces and input/output devices are not suitable for persons with limited capabilities such as, by way of example, little children or disabled persons (e.g., blind, handicapped, etc.). For example, little children may not be able to input, using a keyboard, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that addresses the location of the multimedia content desired by the child. A blind person may also encounter difficulties in inputting a correct URL using a keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There exists a need that allows people with limited capabilities to intuitively access and benefit from the vast amounts of multimedia content that is available on the Internet. Furthermore, current devices and methods used to access the multimedia content on the Internet are unsuitable for companies wanting to market information, entertainment, promotion, education, games, and the like, by distributing tokens and giveaways. Thus, what is desirable is a method for providing intuitive access to the multimedia content through the use of the tokens and giveaways currently used to attract the consumers&apos; attention. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The disadvantages and problems associated with previously developed systems and techniques for providing access to multimedia content have been substantially reduced or eliminated by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention provides an apparatus and method for intuitively accessing multimedia content using physical bookmarks. The apparatus includes a play unit that is coupled to a PC or other digital appliance. The play unit is configured to read or receive as input an identification code from a token, such as, by way of example, a toy, a figurine, a game token, a token attached to a toy or figurine, a bottle cap, or other promotional device. The token may be of arbitrary size and shape, and may be made of materials that provide a sensory sensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For example, the play unit reads the identification code when a user places the token on the play unit in a position that enables the play unit to read the identification code. In one embodiment, the token may be placed on the play unit in any arbitrary angular orientation. The play unit transmits the identification code to the coupled PC or digital appliance. The identification code is used as a factor in determining multimedia content that is subsequently delivered through the PC or digital appliance (e.g., the multimedia content is displayed on a display device coupled to the PC or digital appliance, the multimedia content is audibly broadcast through a speaker coupled to the PC or digital appliance, etc.). Thus, a technical advantage of the present invention includes providing an apparatus and method in which a token functions as a &ldquo;physical bookmark&rdquo; to multimedia content associated with the token. The token may be used in any arbitrary angular orientation to intuitively provide access to multimedia content associated with the token. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a software program executing on the PC or digital appliance receives the identification code from the play unit. The software program transmits the identification code, for example, via a network connection to a physical bookmark server. The physical bookmark server then determines the multimedia content associated with the identification code. The identified multimedia content is transmitted to the PC or digital appliance for delivery to a user. In another embodiment, the software program executing in the PC or digital appliance identifies the multimedia content associated with the identification code and subsequently delivers the appropriate multimedia content to the user. </paragraph>

Thus, a module may include, by way of example, components, such as, software components, processes, functions, subroutines, procedures, attributes, class components, task components, object-oriented software components, segments of program code, drivers, firmware, micro-code, circuitry, data, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The program logic conventionally includes the manipulation of data bits by the processor and the maintenance of these bits within data structures resident in one or more of the memory storage devices. Such data structures impose a physical organization upon the collection of data bits stored within computer memory and represent specific electrical or magnetic elements. These symbolic representations are the means used by those skilled in the art to effectively convey teachings and discoveries to others skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The program logic is generally considered to be a sequence of computer-executed steps. These steps generally require manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, although not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical, magnetic, or optical signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, or otherwise manipulated. It is conventional for those skilled in the art to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, text, terms, numbers, records, files, or the like. It should be kept in mind, however, that these and some other terms should be associated with appropriate physical quantities for computer operations, and that these terms are merely conventional labels applied to physical quantities that exist within and during operation of the computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that manipulations within the computer are often referred to in terms of adding, comparing, moving, searching, or the like, which are often associated with manual operations performed by a human operator. It is to be understood that no involvement of the human operator may be necessary, or even desirable. The operations described herein are machine operations performed in conjunction with the human operator or user that interacts with the computer or computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It should also be understood that the programs, modules, processes, methods, and the like, described herein are but an exemplary implementation and are not related, or limited, to any particular computer, apparatus, or computer language. Rather, various types of general purpose computing machines or devices may be used with programs constructed in accordance with the teachings described herein. Similarly, it may prove advantageous to construct a specialized apparatus to perform the method steps described herein by way of dedicated computer systems with hard-wired logic or programs stored in non-volatile memory, such as, by way of example, read-only memory (ROM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> facilitates the association of a physical bookmark or &ldquo;token&rdquo; to a multimedia content, identification and retrieval of a multimedia content identified by or associated with an identification code, and the subsequent delivery and presentation of the multimedia content to a user. &ldquo;Physical bookmark&rdquo; and &ldquo;token&rdquo; are used interchangeably herein. &ldquo;Physical bookmark&rdquo; or &ldquo;token&rdquo; here generally refers to physical devices that may be used intuitively to access multimedia content that provides educational and/or entertainment (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;edutainment&rdquo;) value. The physical bookmark has associated or affixed an identification code that identifies a multimedia content associated with the particular physical bookmark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the identification code is a machine-readable code that is read by the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For example, a user of a token (e.g., parent, child, toddler, or any other person in possession of the physical bookmark) places the token on the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to enable the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to read the identification code of the token. The play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> transmits the identification code to a program module that causes the subsequent delivery and presentation of the associated multimedia content to the user. The play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is further described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a token may be a promotional product or a marketing premium. A token may, for example, be a toy, a figurine, a game piece or part, a packaging part, a bottle cap, a playing card, etc. that is attached to or otherwise associated with a consumer product or service. The token&apos;s physical characteristics (e.g., association to an identifiable consumer product or service) and the ease with which the token is placed upon the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> makes the token an easy-to-distinguish physical bookmark that is useable by unskilled computer users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> For example, an entity, such as, by way of example, a manufacturer, a distributor, a service provider, a product provider, or an advertiser, may distribute the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, including the software programs and components (e.g., the components necessary to couple the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the program modules that execute on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) needed to make the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> operable, and one or more tokens to users for free or at a substantially reduced price. The tokens may also be distributed to users through various distribution channels independent of the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, one or more tokens may be included as part of, for example, a board game and distributed and sold along with the board game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A token may readily be identifiable with a provider or supplier (e.g., product manufacturer, service provider, etc.) of the token and the identification code associated with the token may provide access to multimedia content that is also identifiable with the provider or supplier of the token and/or the token itself. For example, an amusement park may be a provider of tokens shaped in the form of the amusement park&apos;s popular characters. The tokens may further be associated or affixed with an identification code that is subsequently used to identify, for example, multimedia content which features a story about the character represented by the token. The multimedia content may also be appropriate and safe for access and reception by children, the likely users of these tokens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The tokens, independently or along with the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, may then be distributed to users at the amusement park or through other distribution channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A technical advantage of one embodiment includes providing a marketing vehicle for establishing a lasting communication channel between the provider of a token and the user of the token. The provider of the token may create and distribute tokens that represent popular and sought after characters and objects. Furthermore, the token may provide edutainment to its user in providing access to educational or entertaining multimedia content. The token may also provide an edutainment value to its user independent of the multimedia content. For example, the token may belong to a collection of tokens that is desired and collected by users. Users are inclined to obtain and user the token because of the token&apos;s edutainment value and properties. For example, the user may use the token to access the associated multimedia content because it is edutaining. The user may even repeatedly use the token over extended periods of time. Because the provider of the token controls the multimedia content that is accessed by use of the token, the token provider is able to deliver and present additional content (e.g., promotional content, advertising content, etc.) along with the edutainment content, and thus, establish an effective communication channel to the users of its token. The provider of the token may expire the content in such a way to induce a repeat XV sit to the token provider&apos;s outlet (e.g., game demonstrations, repeat visits to McDonald&apos;s, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be used to determine the right to play a certain piece of multimedia that requires purchasing (i.e., the identification associated with a song or a video file available on the Internet is playable only after its price has been paid). The token may be duplicated repeatedly, but payment is required by a user of the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in order to access the content associated with the token Without payment, the token provides no value to the user. A sponsor may make the payment for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> contains the necessary data and program logic to facilitate the identification, retrieval, and transmission of a multimedia content that is associated with an identification code to a user. A provider of a token (e.g., a manufacturer, service provider, product provider, etc.) may administer and provide the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, an entity other than the token provider such as, by way of example, a provider of computer services, may administer the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and provide the physical bookmark services as disclosed herein to a provider of a token. The physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> maintains data such as, by way of example, registered user information, user preference information, identification codes, mappings between identification codes and identifiers that identify the multimedia content, thus creating an association between the identification code and the multimedia content, and other data necessary to provide the physical bookmark features and functions as disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> contains one or more modules that receive, for example, over the Internet <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> an identification code and optionally, user information (e.g., user login information) from a user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> processes the received information to identify necessary user preference information and the multimedia content associated with the received identification code. The physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> retrieves the appropriate multimedia content, for example, from a content provider <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or from a local copy of the multimedia content maintained on the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and transmits the multimedia content to the requesting user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The Internet <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> facilitates the transfer and transmission of electronic content, including the multimedia content. The Internet <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is a global network connecting millions of computers, including the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and content provider <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The structure of the Internet <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, is a global network of computer networks and utilizes a simple, standard common addressing system and communications protocol known as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). The connections between different networks are called &ldquo;gateways,&rdquo; and the gateways serve to transfer electronic data worldwide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> One part of the Internet <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is the World Wide Web (WWW or Web). The Web is generally used to refer to both (1) a distributed collection of inter-linked, user-viewable hypertext documents (commonly referred to as &ldquo;web documents&rdquo; or &ldquo;web pages&rdquo; or &ldquo;electronic pages&rdquo; or &ldquo;home pages&rdquo;) that are accessible via the Internet <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and (2) the client and server components which provide a user access to such documents (e.g., electronic content, multimedia content, etc.) using standardized Internet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> protocols. The web documents are encoded using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and the primary standard protocol for allowing the components to locate and acquire web documents is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). However, as used herein, the term Web is intended to encompass future languages and protocols, which may be used in place of, or in addition to, HTML and HTTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the Internet <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may advantageously be comprised of one or a combination of other types of networks without detracting from the scope of the invention. The Internet <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can include, by way of example, local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), public internets, private intranets, a private computer network, a secure internet, a private network, a public network, a value-added network, interactive television networks, wireless data transmission networks, two-way cable networks, satellite networks, interactive kiosk networks, and/or any other suitable data network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The content provider <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> generally functions to store and provide the multimedia content to, for example, the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The content provider <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> contains the program logic to receive, for example, from the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> over the Internet <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> a request to access and obtain a multimedia content. The content provider <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> retrieves the requested multimedia content (e.g., a multimedia content identified by an identifier received from the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) and transmits the multimedia content to the requestor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> generally functions as a device used by a user to request multimedia content associated with a token. In one embodiment, the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> contains program logic (e.g., one or more client applications) to receive an identification code associated with the token from a coupled play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> then requests a multimedia content associated with the received identification code, receives the requested multimedia content, and delivers the multimedia content to the user. Multimedia content delivery to the user may include, by way of example, display of the multimedia content on a display device coupled to the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, delivery of the multimedia content through a speaker coupled to the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and other presentation of the multimedia content to the user through devices coupled to the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> contains program logic to determine one or more preferences of a user that is using the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to access multimedia content associated with a physical bookmark. The user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may additionally contain one or more user interface programs (e.g., browser programs) that facilitate the delivery of the multimedia content to the user. For example, the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may contain one or more user interface programs that function to display the requested multimedia content on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. One user interface program may permit the user to navigate to and access other multimedia content independent of the displayed multimedia content. Another user interface program may not provide the user the ability to navigate to and access multimedia content other than the displayed multimedia content or related multimedia content that is accessible through the displayed multimedia content, for example, through embedded hyperlinks in the displayed multimedia content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may contain program logic to determine the user interface that is appropriate for a particular user. In one embodiment, the program logic may request information regarding the user through one or more prompts. The program logic may then determine the appropriate user interface from the user&apos;s response or lack of response to the prompts. For example, the program logic may inquire as to whether the user is able to read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> If the user answers &ldquo;no&rdquo; or fails to answer within a preset time period, the program logic may determine that a user interface providing restricted access (e.g., no access to multimedia content independent of the requested multimedia content) is appropriate for the user. If, the user responded &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the inquiry, the program logic may determine that a more functional user interface is appropriate for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may contain program logic to facilitate the creation of one or more user accounts with the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> creates a default user account for each play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may create the default user accounts, for example, when the play units <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are distributed, when the play units <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are created, when the play units <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are installed and coupled to the user computers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, or when the play units <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are first used to access multimedia content associated with a physical bookmark. The default user account may be identified by a unique identification associated with each play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. A user may then use the program logic to create one or more user accounts, in addition to the default user account, for his or her play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the default user account may be used in instances where a user uses the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> without previously logging on to the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (e.g., a small child or unskilled computer user). If a user first logs on to the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> using a valid user account prior to using the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the active user account, including any user account preferences and parameters, may be considered in delivering the requested multimedia content to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may contain program logic to facilitate the inputting or entering of user information associated with a user account in the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The program logic may be implemented as one or more wizards or prompts that assist a user in specifying user information, such as, by way of example, user data (e.g., name, address, phone number, etc.), user preference data (e.g., preferred language, favorite colors, favorite food, preferred music styles/groups/bands, spot games/teams, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; for the use of &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, etc.), user statistical data (e.g., age, sex, language, etc.), user login (e.g., username and password), content filtering information (e.g., identification of the type of multimedia content to filter), community rights information (e.g., specification of the community services that are permitted and/or prohibited for the user account), and the like. Each user account may be associated with its own user information. Preference data may be used to increase a user&apos;s experience wit the system. For example, a web page can be dynamically built with a color scheme that complies with the user&apos;s favorite colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For example, a parent having two children (a toddler and a teenager) may have created three user accounts (e.g., the default user account for the toddler, one user account for the teenager, and another user account for the parent) a with the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The parent may specify user information for each of the three user accounts. For example, the parent may specify filtering information that restricts the toddler&apos;s user account (the default user account) to only multimedia content that is rated or deemed &ldquo;safe&rdquo; for children. For the teenager&apos;s user account, the parent may specify, in addition to not permitting access to adult content, that the user account is not to grant access to community services intended for adults. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the user information is maintained on the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the user information may be maintained on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and transmitted to the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as required. In still another embodiment, some of the user information may be maintained on the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and other of the user information maintained on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. For example, user information that is sensitive or private (e.g., credit card information, etc.) may be maintained on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and transmitted to the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that some or all of the functions provided by the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be implemented as one or more modules operable to execute on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the functions and multimedia content provided by the content provider <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may also be implemented on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. For example, the multimedia content may be stored on one or more memory devices (e.g., compact disks (CDs), digital video disks (DVDs), memory sticks, etc.) that may be read by devices coupled to the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The program logic to identify the multimedia content associated with an identification code may be implemented as one or more modules executing on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Thus, the apparatus and corresponding methods for providing multimedia content using a physical bookmark may be implemented as an integrated application that executes on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As one example, the multimedia content may be stored on a CD that is inserted in a CD drive coupled to the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As another example, the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be a TV. A DVD player may be coupled to the TV and a play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a DVD disk containing the multimedia content may be inserted in the DVD player. The TV or the DVD player may contain program logic and components to facilitate the functions necessary to process the reading of a physical bookmark, the retrieval of a multimedia content associated with the physical bookmark from the DVD disk, and the display of the multimedia content on or through the TV. Other configurations of electronic devices, storage devices, and communication devices working in conjunction with the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the physical bookmarks as disclosed herein are envisioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> generally functions as an input device that facilitates the reading of an identification code from a token and the transmission of the identification code to a coupled user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> contains components and necessary program logic to detect a placement of a token on the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, to receive or read an identification code from the detected token, and to transmit the identification code to a coupled user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a representation of one embodiment of an exemplary play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. As depicted, the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a play unit housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and a code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> having a code reader window <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The play unit housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> generally functions as a support structure for the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and the code reader window <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The play unit housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> includes an area where the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, including the code reader window <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, may be operably mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> includes a border <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that defines an area, for example, a cavity, where a user places a token for reading by the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the border <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> defines a substantially circular shaped cavity operable to receive a circular shaped token or a circular shaped portion of the token of substantially the same size as the circular shaped cavity. The substantially circular cavity enables, for example, the placement of a token having a circular base of substantially the same size as the cavity to be placed in the cavity in an arbitrary angular orientation. Thus, a user with limited motor skills, such as, by way of example, a small child or a handicapped person, can easily place a token having a circular portion of substantially the same or smaller size in the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is detachable from the play unit housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, thus enabling other detachable receptacles <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to be operably mounted on the play unit housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Thus, the play station housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may operably support receptacles <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> having cavities of different shapes and sizes that are suitable for use with tokens of substantially similar shapes and sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> generally functions to read the identification code from a token operably placed within the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is a barcode reader operable to read a barcode affixed to the area on a token that is operably placed on the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and in particular, the cavity defined by the border <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is operably positioned below the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in the play unit housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The code reader window <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is operably positioned at the base of the cavity of the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, thus enabling the code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to read, through the code reader window <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, an identification code affixed to a token placed within the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a positioning mechanism, such as, by way of example, a needle, a pole, a stile, etc., is set on the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to enable a token having a cavity (e.g., a hole) to be properly positioned on the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. For example, the token, and in particular, the cavity of the token, is placed to fit on the positioning mechanism. The positioning mechanism guides the token into an operable position for reading by the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The positioning mechanism may be a polygonal central pole having a conical tip that guides the token into a predefined position. In still another embodiment, the positioning mechanism may be a cavity on the side wall of the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and a &ldquo;tongue&rdquo; on the token, and visa versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> comprises an electro-optic (also referred to as optoelectronic) sensor. The electro-optic sensor is a sensor that converts light into an electronic signal. A linear electro-optic sensor may be a linear array of, for example, discrete photo-diodes, photo-transistors, a linear CMOS or CCD chip, having a number (e.g., N) pixels or sensor elements. The electro-optic sensor is further described below in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may comprise an area electro-optic sensor. An area electro-optic sensor is a two-dimensional array of light sensing elements, which results in an output of, for example, N&times;N pixels. Examples of area electro-optic sensors include a TV camera tube in a video camera and a CCD or CMOS single chip imaging sensor commonly used in the solid state video cameras and electronic still cameras. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is detachable from the play unit housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The detachable code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may then be used as a portable device to read identification codes affixed to tokens without requiring the token to be placed on the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. For example, a user may use the detachable code reader <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to read identification codes affixed to tokens that are not suitable for placing on the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or tokens that are not shaped to fit within the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> cavity. The play unit housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may operably support code readers <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> having code reader windows <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which are of varying shapes and which are oriented in differing positions. Furthermore, the play unit housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may operably support detachable code readers <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, such as, by way of example, a laser scanner of the type available from Symbol Technologies, USA, or an RFID reader (i.e., BiSatix available from Motorola) for an RFID tag marked on tokens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is a representation of one embodiment of an exemplary receptacle <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> keyed to receive a polygonal-shaped object. As depicted, the receptacle <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> includes a substantially circular cavity opening <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> having tapered sides <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> which lead to a polygonal shaped base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The polygonal shaped base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is in the shape of an octagon. In other embodiments, the polygonal shaped base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be in the shape of other polygons, such as, by way of example, a triangle, square, rectangle, pentagon, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The polygonal shaped base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is operable to receive, for example, a token having a base of substantially similar shape and size as the polygonal shaped base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. For example, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B, a</cross-reference> puppy token <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> mounted on an octagonal base <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of substantially the same size as the octagonal polygonal shaped base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be placed in the receptacle <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Thus, the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that includes the receptacle <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> may operably read an identification code affixed to the underside or bottom of the octagonal base <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The tapered sides <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> function to guide the proper placement of the puppy token <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> into the receptacle <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The process of token insertion requires no or minimal mental activity in that a user merely pushes the token into the receptacle <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> through the circular cavity opening <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and slightly rotates the token until the token fits in the polygonal shaped base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. A similar easy placing procedure can be performed using, for example, the aforementioned central pole having a polygonal shape with a conical tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates selected components of a play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, according to one embodiment. As depicted, the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a receptacle <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a micro-switch <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, a lens <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, a power amplifier <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, a linear illumination array <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, a battery <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, an antenna <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, a CMOS sensor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, a microcontroller <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, a modulator <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and a generator <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The aforementioned components comprise an opto-electric barcode reader. Also depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a token <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> having a base with a substantially circular bottom having affixed, drawn, or imprinted on the bottom or underside of the base a rotation symmetrical barcode <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. The base of the token <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is of the size to be placed into the receptacle <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As depicted, the micro-switch <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the power amplifier <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, the linear illumination array <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the CMOS sensor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the modulator <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and the generator <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are coupled to the battery. The battery <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> generally functions as a power source providing power to the aforementioned components coupled to the battery <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the battery <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may be replaced by a power source provided by, for example, a user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or other electronic appliance coupled to the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, dashed or broken lines depict the power supply connections, and solid or continuous lines depict signal and control connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The micro-switch <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is connected to the linear illumination array <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Placing the token <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> in the receptacle <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> depresses or activates the micro-switch <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> which initiates the reading of the rotation symmetrical barcode <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> from the bottom of the token <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. The micro-switch <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> activates the linear illumination array <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and the linear illumination array <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> illuminates the rotation symmetrical barcode <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> through a slit or a barcode reader window (not depicted). In particular, a portion of the barcode rings or lines comprising the rotation symmetrical barcode <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> that is accessible through the slit is illuminated. In one embodiment, the slit is made sufficiently narrow to prevent misreads stemming from the curvature of the barcode rings in accord with the required sensitivity of the opto-electric barcode reader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a light source illuminating a photodiode may replace the micro-switch <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Obstructing the light falling on the photodiode, for example, by placing the token <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> into the receptacle <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, may initiate the reading of the rotation symmetrical barcode <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Illuminating the rotation symmetrical barcode <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> causes the lens <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to focus the image of the illuminated barcode onto a connected CMOS sensor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the CMOS sensor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> may be implemented using the LIS-1024 linear electro-optic CMOS sensor, which is available from Photon Vision Systems, USA. In a modification of this embodiment, a linear rod lens array can be used to minimize the overall barcode reader height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The microcontroller <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is connected to the CMOS sensor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, and receives the signal output from the CMOS sensor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The microcontroller <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is connected to the modulator <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and the microcontroller <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> processes the signal from the CMOS sensor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to form an appropriate pulse sequence for the modulator <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the microcontroller <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is the PIC12C607, which is available from Microchip, USA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The modulator <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> modulates the received pulse sequence and applies the modulated signal to the connected generator <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the generator <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is a radio frequency (RF) generator. The generator transforms the modulated signal to an RF signal that is input into the power amplifier <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. The power amplifier <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> amplifies the input signal and emits the amplified signal via the antenna <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. For example, the signal is transmitted to a receiver coupled to a user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the signal may be transmitted to a user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that is coupled to the play station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by a wired connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may contain components and program logic that enriches the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> local control and feedback capabilities. For example, the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include components such as a display device (e.g., an LCD) and/or a speaker to display or present the requested multimedia content. The play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also include a user interface that presents to the user basic control commands such as, by way of example, Play/Pause/Stop for music and videos, and Back/Forward/Home for electronic content that is displayed on the coupled display device, which enable the user to control the delivery of the multimedia content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a representation of one embodiment of an exemplary token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> bearing a barcode <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. In particular, the token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is a substantially circular disk-shaped object having affixed, drawn, or imprinted upon a potion of one side of the disk a barcode <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The disk-shaped tokens are convenient for arranging CD-like and other collections. The barcode <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is a concentric symmetrical code having concentric barcode lines comprising the concentric barcode positioned toward the outer rim of the token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. As depicted, the token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is operably positioned in a receptacle <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> having a vertical linear sensor <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The receptacle <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> comprises a slit opening that provides access to a cavity. The slit opening is large enough to permit the insertion of a circular disk-shaped object into the cavity. The circular or polygonal disk-shaped object is placed edge first into the cavity through the slit opening. The bottom of the cavity (e.g., the end substantially opposite the slit opening) is keyed or shaped to receive a portion of the substantially circular rim of the inserted circular disk-shaped object. The angular symmetry of the token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the slit and the cavity positioning facilitate the easy insertion of the token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> into the receptacle <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. Thus, a user can easily place a token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> into the receptacle <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> to request the multimedia content associated with the identification code represented by the barcode <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The vertical linear sensor <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is operably positioned to read the concentric barcode lines comprising the barcode <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, a picture may be affixed to one or both sides of the token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The picture is positioned not to obstruct the barcode <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. For example, a small child may identify or associate the type of multimedia content that is associated with the token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> by the picture that is affixed to token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the barcode <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may be affixed to both sides of token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. In still another embodiment, each side of the token <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may have affixed a different barcode <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a representation of another embodiment of an exemplary token <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> bearing a barcode <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. In particular, the token <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is a substantially circular disk-shaped object having affixed, drawn, or imprinted upon a potion of one side of the disk a barcode <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. The barcode <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is a radial code positioned toward the outer rim of the token <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. As depicted, the token <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is operably positioned in a cavity of a receptacle <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> having a horizontal linear sensor <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. The barcode <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> comprises radially-positioned barcode lines that are repetitive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> For example, a sequence of radial barcode lines that comprise a complete radial barcode (e.g., from a start of a barcode to an end of the barcode) is repeated to create the barcode <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. This enables the barcode <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> to be read by the horizontal linear sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> having a length sufficient enough to detect and read a complete radial barcode without regard to the position of the token <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in the cavity of receptacle <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the horizontal linear sensor <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> may be designed in a bent shape having a curvature radius substantially equal to that of the circular disk-shaped object rim designed to operably fit in the receptacle <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> cavity (e.g., the token <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). The sensor having such a curved shape contributes to eliminate the bar and space width aberrations that are inherent in the radial barcode lines comprising the barcode <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrates an exemplary polygonal barcode, according to one embodiment. In particular, the polygonal barcode is an octagonal barcode suitable for affixing, for example, on the underside of the octagonal base <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). As depicted, the octagon is a regular octagon that provides eight distinctive positions. Each of the positions is shaped substantially as a triangle having one side extending from substantially the center of the octagon to a first vertex of the octagon, the second side extending from substantially the center of the octagon to an second vertex that is adjacent to the first vertex of the octagon, and the base extending from substantially the first vertex to the second vertex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A radius length barcode can be printed in each of the eight distinctive positions of the octagon. Alternatively, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, four diameter length barcodes can be printed in the eight distinctive positions where the first half of each barcode is printed in a first distinctive position and the second half of each barcode is printed in a second distinctive position opposite the first distinctive position. Thus, the number of possible barcode combinations is squared or raised to the power of two. To read the octagonal shaped barcode, the code reader window <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) is constructed, for example, on the diameter of the base of the cavity of the receptacle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) in a position to read two opposite sides of the octagon (e.g., two opposite distinctive positions). Only the portion of the barcode covered by the sensor&apos;s field of view are essential for the reading, whereas all the remaining surface of the triangles can be used for other purposes (e.g., printing a picture, etc.). The vertices of the polygon serve as guides, which do not allow the code reader window <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) to read along the barcode meet-line depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a polygonal-shaped disk can be used in a system, such as that depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, where the bottom of the cavity is shaped to receive a portion of the polygonal-shaped disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>D illustrate exemplary associations between identification codes and multimedia content, according to one embodiment. An identification code, in its simplest form, is associated with a multimedia content (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>). As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, the multimedia content does not provide access to any other multimedia content. The multimedia content does not include, for example, hyperlinks or links (herein after collectively referred to as links) to other multimedia content. For example, this form of association may be useful in providing multimedia content that is safe for children (e.g., &ldquo;child-safe&rdquo; content). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> illustrates an identification code that is associated with a multimedia content, where the multimedia content provides access to other multimedia content. The multimedia content associated with the identification code includes, for example, one or more links to other multimedia content. The multimedia content associated with the identification code may also include search engines that function to provide access to other multimedia content. For example, this form of association may be useful in providing multimedia content to adults. This form of association may also be used to provide child-safe content to children, where the other accessible multimedia content is also child-safe and any provided search engine limits or restricts searches and search results to child-safe content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference> illustrates an identification code that is associated with more than one multimedia content. As depicted, each of the multimedia content does not provide access to any other multimedia content. In one embodiment, one or more user information items (e.g., user data, user preference data, user statistical data, user login, etc.) may be used in addition to the identification code to determine the multimedia content associated with the identification code that is appropriate for the user. For example, a token provider may create an identification code that is associated with one multimedia content suitable for users capable of reading. The same identification code is also associated with a second multimedia content suitable for users incapable of reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</cross-reference> illustrates an identification code that is associated with more than one multimedia content. As depicted, the identification code is associated with a first multimedia content that provides access to other multimedia content, and a second multimedia content that does not provide access to other multimedia content. Similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>C, one or more user information items may be used in addition to the identification code to determine the multimedia content associated with the identification code that is appropriate for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary user interface <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> for children according to one embodiment. The user interface <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> may be implemented as, for example, an Internet type browser that is graphically rich but functionally restricted. As depicted, the user interface <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> includes a control panel <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and a display area <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. The control panel <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> includes the following navigational buttons: a back button <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, a forward button <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, and a home button <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. The multimedia content is displayed in the display area <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the navigational buttons <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> are the only navigational commands provided by the user interface <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. The navigational buttons <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> may function in a manner similar to the comparable navigational commands found in readily available Internet browsers such as, by way of example, the Netscape Navigator&reg; developed by Netscape, Inc., and the Microsoft Internet Explorer&reg; developed by Microsoft Corporation. The user interface <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> does not provide an interface for inputting an arbitrary Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Thus, the user interface <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is suitable to deliver child-safe multimedia content. In other embodiment, some or all of the navigational buttons <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> may not be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the multimedia content displayed through the user interface <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, either by using a token or activating one of the navigational buttons <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, is filtered to remove content that is not suitable for delivery to children. In one embodiment, the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may contain program logic that identifies multimedia content requested by a child user. The program logic may then remove content, such as, by way of example, links in the multimedia content, etc. which are not suitable for children. In another embodiment, user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may contain the program logic to filter and remove multimedia content that is not suitable for children. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a flow chart of an exemplary method <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> by which a physical bookmark is created, according to one embodiment. Beginning at a start step <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, a provider of a token (e.g., a manufacturer, a distributor, a product provider, a service provider, an advertiser, etc.) wants to provide users a token that functions as a physical bookmark. At a step <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, the provider registers an identification code with an administrator of the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The identification code is the identification code the provider wants to affix to or otherwise associate with the token or tokens. In one embodiment, the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may set, for example, a flag that indicates that the identification code is active (e.g., the identification code has been registered and is in use). At a step <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, the provider specifies to the administrator of the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> a multimedia content to associate with the identification code registered in prior step <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. The provider may specify, for example, a URL as an identifier that identifies the multimedia content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may request additional information such as, by way of example, provider name, address, contact data, description of the token that will have the identification code, one or more descriptors describing the multimedia content (e.g., child-safe content, adult content, audio, video, text, graphics, animation, etc.), and the like. The provider may additionally provide filtering information to associate with the multimedia content. For example, assuming that the multimedia content provides access to content intended for adults, the provider may specify an age limit as one exemplary filter. In another example, assuming that the multimedia content provides access to an online community service (e.g., access to an online chat room, etc.) that is intended and set up to host female children living in Israel, the provider may specify an age requirement (e.g., less than <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> years old), a gender requirement (e.g., female), and a residence location requirement (e.g., Israel) as three exemplary filters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> creates and maintains the information submitted by the provider of the token in one or more databases. The physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> uses this information to identify the multimedia content and to filter the multimedia content as necessary before delivery to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the provider of the token may specify more than one multimedia content to associate with the identification code registered in prior step <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. For example, the provider may specify a multimedia content in English to deliver to users residing in English speaking countries, and another multimedia content in Japanese to deliver to users residing in Japan. At step <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, the provider attaches the identification code to the tokens. For example, the tokens may be manufactured with the identification codes affixed to a portion of the token. At step <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, the provider distributes the tokens to, for example, the intended users, and ends at step <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that, for this and other methods disclosed herein, the functions performed in the exemplary flow charts may be implemented in differing order. Furthermore, the steps outlined in the flow charts are only exemplary, and some of the steps may be optional, combined into fewer steps, or expanded into additional steps without detracting from the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates selected components of a physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, according to one embodiment. As depicted, the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes the following exemplary components: a code-mapping directory <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, a content and users directory <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, a user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, a cache module <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, a content validation module <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, and a statistical module <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the components <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> are coupled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The code-mapping directory <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> generally functions to provide information about the association between multimedia content and identification codes in the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the code-mapping directory <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is implemented as a database. The database contains records that store information regarding the association between the identification codes and its respective multimedia content or an identifier that identifies the multimedia content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a record in the code-mapping directory <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> contains, by way of example, a code value, a code descriptor, a content/service link descriptor, a owner descriptor, a cache descriptor, and a validity descriptor. The code value specifies an identification code. The code descriptor specifies the type of the identification code and the parameters necessary to edit and produce the code&apos;s physical representation (e.g., barcode type, permitted width variations, color, IR or B/W, printed or engraved, etc.). The content/service link descriptor identifies the multimedia content and/or service. The content/service link descriptor specifies how to obtain the multimedia content and/or service and may include, for example, an identifier and optionally a primary and a secondary URL. </paragraph>

Beginning at a start step <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, a client application executing on a user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> receives an identification code from a play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> coupled to the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and transmits a user login data and an identification code to the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The user login data identifies the current user of the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the token having the identification code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> receives a request (e.g., a data packet, request packet, etc.) from the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The request includes the login data and the identification code transmitted by the client application on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> checks to determine if the necessary information and data regarding the user (e.g., the user account associated with the login data) to process the request is stored in cache memory, for example, the cache module <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. If the necessary user information is not stored in cache memory, then at step <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> retrieves the necessary user information from, for example, the content and users directory <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, and stores the retrieved user information in cache memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, the necessary user information was stored in cache memory, or after retrieving and storing the necessary user information in cache memory (step <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>), the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> checks to determine if the code-mapping data necessary to determine the multimedia content that is associated with the identification code is stored in cache memory at step <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. If the necessary code-mapping data is not stored in cache memory, then at step <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> retrieves the necessary code-mapping data from, for example, the code-mapping directory <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, and stores the retrieved code-mapping data in cache memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, the necessary code-mapping data was stored in cache memory, or after retrieving and storing the necessary code-mapping data in cache memory (step <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>), the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> checks to determine if the identification code maps directly to a multimedia content at step <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> may check the content/service link descriptor to determine if the identification code maps directly to an identifier that identifies the multimedia content, such as, by way of example, a URL. If the identification code maps to, for example, a direct URL, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> can request or obtain the multimedia content using the URL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> If the identification code maps to a direct URL, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> determines if a local copy of the multimedia content identified by the direct URL is stored in cache memory at step <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight>. If the identified multimedia content is not stored in cache memory, then at step <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> uses the direct URL to retrieve the multimedia content from, for example, a content provider <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and stores the retrieved multimedia content in cache memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight>, the multimedia content was stored in cache memory, or after retrieving and storing the multimedia content in cache memory (step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>018</bold></highlight>), the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> logs statistical information and data at step <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> uses the statistical module <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> to log the information and data regarding, for example, the user, the token, and the multimedia content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> determines if the multimedia content is suitable for the user, and in particular, the user account associated with the login information. In one embodiment, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> uses the content validation module <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> and the filtering information associated with the user account to determine if the user is authorized to receive the multimedia content. If, at step <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> determines that the multimedia content is not suitable for the user, then, at step <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> transmits an error message to the requesting user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and ends at step <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> determines that the multimedia content is suitable for the user, then, at step <highlight><bold>1038</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> transmits the multimedia content to the requesting user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and ends at step <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> may remove the unsuitable content from the multimedia content and transmit the filtered multimedia content to the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> If, at prior step <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>, the identification code does not map to a direct URL, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> determines a content dispatcher to use to identify the multimedia content. In one example, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> uses the codemapping directory <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> to identify the proper content dispatcher. The content dispatcher contains program code to determine a multimedia content for the identification code using additional information such as, by way of example, user preference, user age, user language, the time of the request, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1026</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> sends the necessary user information to the proper content dispatcher. At step <highlight><bold>1028</bold></highlight>, the content dispatcher uses the user information to identify the multimedia content appropriate for the user and the identification code. At step <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>, the content dispatcher determines if the identified multimedia content is suitable/allowed for the user. For example, the multimedia content provider may have specified flags or descriptors that identify the nature of the multimedia content, the intended recipients, etc. If the multimedia content is not authorized for the user, then, at step <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> transmits an error message to the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and ends at step <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>, the content dispatcher determines that the identified multimedia content is suitable for the user, the content dispatcher returns a URL for the multimedia content to the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the content dispatcher can be integrated with a content server, thus eliminating the need to connect to a different server at step <highlight><bold>1034</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1032</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> receives the URL from the content dispatcher. At step <highlight><bold>1034</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> uses the URL to retrieve the multimedia content from, for example, a content provider <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>1036</bold></highlight>, the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> stores the retrieved multimedia content in cache memory. If, at step <highlight><bold>1032</bold></highlight>, the content dispatcher returned, for example, an identifier in cache memory to the multimedia content, or after storing the multimedia content (step <highlight><bold>1036</bold></highlight>), the user agent/proxy module <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> continues processing from step <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a flow chart of an exemplary method <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> by which a user creates a physical bookmark, according to one embodiment. Beginning at a start step <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, a registered user wants to create a physical bookmark. For example, the user wants to associate multimedia content to a token bearing an identification code. At step <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, the user uses, for example, his or her user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and logs on to the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, the user activates a browser and browses to the multimedia content (e.g., web page) the user wants the physical bookmark to reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>, the user places a token operably on the play unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that is coupled to the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The token used is the token the user wants to use as the physical bookmark. For example, the user may use a token that has some physical features related to the type of content bookmarked by the token. At step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, the user requests the creation of the physical bookmark (e.g., the association between the token and the multimedia content), and ends at step <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a user executes a client application on the user computer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to request the creation of the physical bookmark. The client application transmits to the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> the user&apos;s request to create the physical bookmark. The transmitted request may contain, without limitation, the user&apos;s login identification (e.g., the user account), the identification code read from the token, and the URL or other identification for the multimedia content. The physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may then create the requested physical bookmark by recording the association between the user account, the identification code, and the multimedia content. In another embodiment, the user may specify a login identification that is different from the one the user used to log on to the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the user may use the personally created physical bookmarks to access multimedia content associated with the physical bookmarks. In one embodiment, the physical bookmark server <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may require that the user be logged on using the login identification that was used to create the physical bookmark. This enables a single token (identification code) to bookmark different multimedia content depending on the login identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> As described herein, the present invention in at least one embodiment allows for the creating of a communication channel between a token provider and a token user. In one embodiment, a token and a play unit and the necessary software, are distributed for free or at a reduced price to create a loyal base of users (e.g., consumers/customer base). The tokens are associated with multimedia content specified by the token providers. The users use the tokens to access the associated multimedia content. Because the token providers control the multimedia content, the token providers have created a communication channel to the users of its tokens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In at least one embodiment, the present invention enables a token provider to benefit from having direct access to statistical information regarding the use of the provider&apos;s tokens. The token provider may use the quantitative feedback for narrowing consumer targeting, to promote and augment the preference of products and services, while driving traffic to both online and offline shops or c-commerce sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The present invention, in at least one embodiment, enables a user to restrict access to multimedia content that meets certain criteria. For example, a parent who wants to control the content their children can access can restrict the multimedia content to childsafe content. Furthermore, a child-safe browser that restricts access to multimedia content may be provided for the children. Thus, the children can be prevented from retrieving arbitrary content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In at least one embodiment, the present invention provides tokens that are adapted for use by children. The identification code reading procedure involves a simple operation by a user. The user is able to place the token on a play unit in an arbitrary angular orientation to cause the identification code to be read by the play unit. This allows small children to use the tokens to access the multimedia content. Furthermore, the tokens may be in shapes of toys the children are familiar with. The shape of the token may also provide an indication to the children of the type and nature of the associated multimedia content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> This invention may be provided in other specific forms and embodiments without departing from the essential characteristics as described herein. The embodiments described above are to be considered in all aspects as illustrative only and not restrictive in any manner.
