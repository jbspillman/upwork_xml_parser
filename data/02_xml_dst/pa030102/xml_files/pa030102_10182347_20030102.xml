<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to display apparatus for displaying an image by back projection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There is currently much interest in the use of back projection in display devices which are used in applications such for example as arcade games, large television screens and large monitor screens. There is even currently much interest in the use of back projection in display devices as a replacement for cathode ray tube monitors and liquid crystal display monitors in desktop computer displays. Display devices utilise a projector and a screen and in many cases, the projector and the screen are built into a unit, often using mirrors to fold the path of the light. Projected images are best viewed in a darkened room because ambient light reflecting from the screen reduces the contrast of the image. However, for many of the above mentioned applications, darkness is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many display devices using back projection have the following two problems. The first problem is that the back projection screens work by scattering the light projected from behind mostly in the forward direction, thus forming an image. Usually, this scattering process destroys the polarisation of the light and renders it randomly polarised. The second problem is that ambient light which is incident from the front of the screen is mostly transmitted through the screen where it can be absorbed by black surfaces. Some ambient light scatters forward and it is this light which is detrimental to the contrast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are some types of known screen material which maintain the polarisation state of the incident light, thereby overcoming the above mentioned first problem. We have now been found that those types of screen which preserve the polarisation of back projected light, will also preserve the polarisation of ambient light incident from the front. The reflection of this light can be suppressed by means of a circular polariser, thereby overcoming the above mentioned second problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, in accordance with one non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, there is provided display apparatus for displaying an image by back projection, which display apparatus comprises a projector, a screen, and a quarterwave retarder, the screen being a back projection screen that maintains the polarisation state of incident light, the quarterwave retarder being orientated such that its axis is at 45&deg; to the axis of polarised light from the projector, and the quarterwave retarder being such that it circularly polarises linearly polarised light that it receives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The display apparatus of the present invention is able to provide improved contrast of an image displayed on a screen in bright ambient light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The quarterwave retarder is preferably a polymer sheet quarterwave retarder. Other types of quarterwave retarder may however be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The quarterwave retarder may be positioned in front of a projector lens from the projector. Alternatively, the quarterwave retarder may be built into the projector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The display apparatus may include polariser means which is positioned such that the screen lies between the projector and the polariser means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The polariser means may be laminated to the screen. Preferably, the polariser means is laminated to the screen so as to form a single sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The polariser means may be a quarterwave retarder and a circular polariser, the orientation of the quarterwave retarder relative to the circular polariser being such that the polariser means transmits the polarised light that it receives. Preferably, the linear polarising component of the circular polariser is oriented parallel to the linear polarisation axis of the projector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the display apparatus is one in which the projector is such that it provides the linearly polarised light. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the display apparatus may be one in which the projector is such that it provides unpolarised light, and in which the display apparatus includes a polariser which is positioned between the projector and the quarterwave retarder and which is for providing the linearly polarised light. This would halve the light output from the projector and is thus a less preferred embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the invention will now be described solely by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows display apparatus for displaying an image by back projection; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an enlarged part of a portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an enlarged part of another portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>.</paragraph>
</summary-of-invention>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, there is shown display apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for displaying an image by back projection. The display apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises a projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a screen <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The screen <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is a back projection screen <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that maintains the polarisation state of incident light <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is orientated such that its axis is at 45&deg; to the axis of polarised light <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The light <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is linearly polarised light. The quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is in the form of a quarterwave retarder plate. The quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> circularly polarises the linear polarised light from the projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is a polymer sheet quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is positioned in front of a projector lens part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The display apparatus includes polariser means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is positioned such that the screen lies between the projector and the polariser means. More specifically, the polariser means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is laminated to the screen <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to form a single sheet. The polariser means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a polariser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The orientation of the quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> relative to the polariser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is such that the polariser means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> transmits the polarised light that it receives. The linear polarising component of the circular polariser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is orientated parallel to the linear polarisation axis of the projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The various light paths and the type of polarised light are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> involving projected light, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> involving ambient light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The display apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> operates such that light from the projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is able to pass through the screen <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the circular polariser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Thus the light from the projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be viewed as normal. Ambient light however will become circularly polarised before it falls on to the screen <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Because the screen <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> mostly maintains that polarisation on the light, which is reflected forwards, this light will be unable to pass back through the circular polariser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This light is thus unable to interfere with the image, and the contrast is improved. This is especially advantageous in bright ambient light where, hitherto, the contrast has often been insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that the embodiment of the invention described above with reference to the accompanying drawings has been given by way of example only and that modifications may be effected. Thus, for example, the quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may be built into the projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> instead of being positioned in front of the projector lens part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> could be such that it provides an unpolarised output, which is then polarised by a polariser positioned between the projector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the quarterwave retarder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
