<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a wafer chuck and an exposure technique which use the wafer chuck, and to a manufacturing technique of semiconductor device and, more particularly, to a technique which is effectively applied to a wafer chuck or the like used for vacuum-chucking a semiconductor wafer in the steps in manufacturing a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For example, in an exposure system which coats a resist on a semiconductor wafer and which exposes and develops a circuit pattern of one layer formed on a reticle serving as an original so as to form a predetermined resist pattern on the semiconductor wafer, the degree of flatness of the semiconductor wafer is an important technical object in order to prevent resolving defects caused by not obtaining an image formation within a focal depth and to form a sharp circuit pattern. For this reason, a flat state of the semiconductor wafer is to be required by such a way that the wafer is vacuum-chucked from the rear surface thereof by a wafer chuck having a high degree of flatness. An exposure process is performed to the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As an example in which such an exposure system is described in detail, &ldquo;VLSI MANUFACTURING AND TEST DEVICE GUIDEBOOK IN 1998&rdquo; issued by Kogyo Chosakai Publishing Co., Ltd. (Nov. 20, 1997) is known. The wafer chuck has a configuration in which a large number of support pins are implanted inside a cap-like vessel. However, in this structure, the outer peripheral wall of the cup-like vessel and the large number of support pins are brought into contact with the rear surface of the semiconductor wafer so as to apply the negative pressure into the cap-like vessel, thereby supporting the semiconductor wafer. Therefore, warpage of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer is not sufficiently corrected. Since micropatterning in a process makes the focal depth further small, flattening a semiconductor wafer in exposure becomes an important technical object every year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With respect to the art, as an important which increases the degree of flatness in the peripheral portion of a semiconductor wafer, an art disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-37227 is known. This art can achieve a predetermined effect such an in correction of upward warping transformation at the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in the wafer chuck described in the above conventional art, a sufficient degree of flatness cannot be achieved. More specifically, when a wafer is warped reversely (downwardly) in the above invention, the invention does not disclose a predetermined relationship in shape which corrects the warpage so that wafer correction for realizing a high degree of flatness in the entire area of the semiconductor wafer has a given limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a technique which can more effectively prevent warpage of a semiconductor wafer vacuum-chucked on a wafer check and which can realize a high degree of flatness of the entire area of the semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a technique which can vacuum-chuck semiconductor wafers having various diameters on single wafer chuck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a technique which can improve the manufacturing yield of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The above objects and other objects of the present invention and novel characteristic features will be apparent from the description of this specification and the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The outline of typical one of the aspects of the present invention will be briefly described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> More specifically, a wafer chuck according to the present invention is adopted to flatly vacuum-chucks a semiconductor wafer having a rear surface which is held on support pins by suction with a suction chamber at a negative pressure applied thereto, the suction chamber surrounded by an external wall, wherein the upper surface of the external wall is formed to have a level slightly lower than those of the upper surfaces of the support pins; the external wall does not chuck the semiconductor wafer and does not in contact with the semiconductor wafer; and air is slightly sucked into the suction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In addition, the wafer chuck is characterized in that the distance between the external wall and the closest support pin is kept constant, a moment is generated such that the gradient of the semiconductor wafer being in contact with the outermost closest support pin is small, and flexure of the semiconductor wafer caused by vacuum is minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An exposure system according to the present invention is characterized by being constituted by using the wafer chuck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present invention applies the wafer chuck to the step of polishing a semiconductor wafer and an exposure system for exposing the semiconductor wafer to manufacture a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to the wafer chuck having the above constitution, inflow air generates a pressure loss by the external wall to make the pressure in the suction chamber negative, a vacuum pressure between the external wall and the closest support pin is generated by the negative pressure. When a moment generated by the vacuum pressure is equal to moment acting on the internal side of the closest support pin, the wafer is not inclined at a position above the closest support pin because the moments are balanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the distance between the external wall and the closest support pin is not more than a predetermined distance, flexure or gradient of the wafer from the closest support pin to an external bank can be made sufficiently small. For this reason, the degree of flatness of the wafer near the peripheral portion of the wafer can be maintained at high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to the exposure system using the wafer chuck described above, even in a micropatterning process having a small focal depth, a preferable circuit pattern can be transferred to a semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the method of manufacturing a semiconductor using the wafer chuck or the exposure system, a semiconductor device can be manufactured even in a micropatterning process having a small focal depth.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 1) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram showing an exposure system using a wafer chuck according to an embodiment of the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing the wafer chuck and a semiconductor wafer, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a plan view of the wafer chuck in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view of a part along a line A-A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exposure system provided with a wafer chuck uses, for example, an Hg lamp <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as an exposure light source. Exposure light <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> emitted from the Hg lamp <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is converged by an elliptic mirror <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and then converged by a condensing lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through a reflector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a relay lens <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and a reflector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The light passing through the illumination system takes a circuit pattern formed in a reticle <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and is reduced by a reduction lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so that the light is finally projected on a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> chucked by a wafer chuck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the circuit pattern is transferred onto the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on which a resist is coated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The wafer chuck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is comprised of a material such as ceramics to prevent transformation caused by aging or thermal expansion and is arranged to chuck the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the wafer chuck includes a suction chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is surrounded by an external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and which is formed in a chuck body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The suction chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to an external exhaust pump or the like (not shown) through a suction hole <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed to have a size which is slightly smaller than that of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and is curved to the rear surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to prevent adhesion or the like of the coated resist solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The upper surface of the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is designed to be slightly lower than the level of a plurality of support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which support the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from its rear surface. The rear surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have a small gap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the suction chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from which air is exhausted through the suction hole <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> communicates with the outside through the gap. A leakage flow rate Q is expressed by the following equation from theoretical calculation and an experimental result. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Q&equals;</italic></highlight>3<highlight><italic>b&dgr;</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>/4 &mgr;&middot;<highlight><italic>dp/dx</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> where, b: peripheral length of external wall, &dgr;: gap, &mgr;: viscosity coefficient, dP/dx: pressure gradient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in Equation 1, when the gap is made small, the viscosity of air flowing in the gap strongly acts, and a pressure loss generated when air passes through the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (vacuum seal is established from when the pressure loss is generated). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As an experimental example, the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (rear surface is satin-finished) having a diameter &phgr; of 200 was used, the width of the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was 0.3 mm, the gap &dgr; was 0.5 &mgr;m, and the pressure of a vacuum source was 0.79 kPa (600 mmHg). In this case, a decrease in pressure caused by inflow of air from the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was 3.2%. In the same way, a decrease in pressure in a conventional structure in which the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was in contact with a pin was 1.3%. When the width of the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the gap &dgr; are changed, a decrease in pressure can be controlled. For this reason, the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which copes with a change in diameter of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are supported by the sharp-pointed support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the pressing pressures are generated at the tops of the support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> due to a pressure difference dP between the pressure of the suction chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the atmospheric pressure. However, it is experientially known that a result is obtained on the assumption that transformation of a portion pressed by a continuous surface such as the surface of the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is different from transformation of a portion pressed by the tops of the support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This difference is related to a vacuum pressure, the areas of the tops of the pins, the arrangement of pins, the condition of the rear surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, although no continuous contact portion is provided between the rear surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the arrangement of the support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> must be considered. When the alignment pitches of the support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are set as equal as possible, and when closest support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is arranged to receive vacuum pressures which are equal to each other, the highest degree of flatness can be obtained regardless of the condition of the rear surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be arranged such that a distance (distance L1) between the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the closest support pin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is almost equal to half an alignment pitch L2 of the support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. When an accuracy error of within &plusmn;50 nm is set on a target, the alignment pitch L2 of the internal support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the distance L1 between the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the closest support pin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>desirably satisfy a relation: L2/6&lE;L1&lE;L2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The relation between the distance L1 between the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the closest support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the alignment pitch L2 of the internal support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be applied to not only alignment pitches in a radial direction of the wafer chuck as described above but also alignment pitches in a circumferential direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> More specifically, from a viewpoint that the pressures received by the support pins are set as equal as possible, the alignment pitch L2 is set to be not more than 1.5 times the distance L1 between the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the closest support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the following reason. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It must be necessary for realizing a high degree of flatness of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that pressures acting on the tops of the support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are set as equal as possible. That is, in vacuum chucking, an area on which the atmospheric pressure acts is equally shared by the support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In particular, a problem is outstandingly posed at a peripheral portion (internal wall <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) of a press-up hole <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into/from which a press-up pin <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for pressing the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (to be described later) enters. Especially, pressures acting on the tops of the closest support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the internal wall <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is considerably influenced on the degree of flatness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> An experimental check for forecasting distortion is performed with respect to this influence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the experiment, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the ratio of the density of alignment of the closest support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which were closest to the internal wall <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the density of alignment of support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which were adjacently outside the alignment of the closest support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>was changed to 1.5 times, and the ratio of a pressure P1 (pressure of area {circle over (1)}) acting on the top of the support pin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to a pressure P2 (pressure of area {circle over (2)}) acting on the top of the support pin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>was set to be 1.5 times to 1/1.5 times. In this case, a distortion of about 90 nm was measured. Since the distortion is 100 nm or less because of other factors, it is considered that the ratio of 1.5 times is the limit of practical use. As a matter of course, in order to obtain a higher accuracy, the ratio should be made closer as possible to 1.0 times rather than 1.5 times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The value L2 must be 1 mm or more because of restrictions or the like of actual processing technology of the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. On the assumption, if P1/P2&equals;{circle over (1)}/{circle over (2)} is allowed to be 1.5 times to 1/1.5 times as described above, the minimum value of the value L2 is 1 mm as described above, in order to control the ratio of area {circle over (1)} to area {circle over (2)} to 1.5 times to 1/1.5 times, the following conditions are satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When the ratio is 1.5 times, L1&equals;L2 is satisfied because L2/2&plus;L1 (&equals;L2)&equals;1.5 times L2 is satisfied. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> However, since L1 is limited to about 0.2 mm due to the restrictions of processing technology, the minimum value of L1 is 0.2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the distance L1 between the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the closest support pin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is desirably set to be up to about 1.8 mm in consideration of flexure of a beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The reason why the distance L1 between the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the closest support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is set to be up to 1.8 mm will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It is assumed that pitches of the closest support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are internally adjacent to the closest support pins <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are represented by L2, an overhang (i.e., distance between the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the closest support pin <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is represented by L1, a distributed load is represented by w, a longitudinal elastic coefficient E, and a geometrical moment of inertia is represented I. In this case, a flexure y of the distal end (immediately above the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) of the overhang is approximately expressed by the following equation: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An Si substrate is supposed as the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, 80 kPa (600 mmHg) are substituted to w, 1.8 mm are substituted to L1, 2 mm are substituted to L2, 166 MPa is substituted to E, and the thickness of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is given by 0.725 mm&rarr;I&equals;0.0318 mm<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>. In this case, the flexure y is given by y&equals;50 nm. In order to achieve a degree of flatness of 100 nm or less, it is proper that the factor of flexure is set to be 50 nm or less. For this reason, it is considered as the necessary condition that L1 is 1.8 mm or less. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to Embodiment 1, an inflow rate of external air changes depending on the distance of the gap between the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The inflow rate of the air is expressed by Equation 1. In this case, when the gap &dgr; is excessively large, the inflow-rate of the gas increases to decrease the pressure in the suction chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. When the inflow rate is excessively small, the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the upper surface of the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the effect described in Embodiment 1 may not be achieved. In addition, when foreign material adhered to the rear surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the foreign material mounds the corresponding portion of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and may deteriorate the degree of flatness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In an experiment, it is assumed that a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a diameter &phgr; of 200 and a satin-finished rear surface is used, the width of the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is 0.3 mm, and the gap distance is 0.5 &mgr;m. About 3% of pressure in the suction chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> decreases. It is assumed that an actual tolerance of a decrease in pressure is set to be 10%. The value is applied to Equation 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> When the width of an external wall is 0.3 mm, the gap &dgr; is 0.75 &mgr;m at the maximum; and when the width of the external wall is 2.0 mm, the gap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is 1.4 &mgr;m at the maximum, so that such values are considered to the maximum until which the gap &dgr; can be set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In addition, a gap &dgr; of 0.1 &mgr;m or more is required at the minimum such that the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is not brought into contact with the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When the width of the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is 2.0 mm or more, the flexure of the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> increases due to the influence of a vacuum pressure.

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the structure of a wafer chuck of a conventional art, the external wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in contact with the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to serve as a vacuum seal.

In this embodiment, as described above, the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is chucked by the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a high degree of flatness and exposed. For this reason, high accuracy of focal lengths of the reduction lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the respective parts of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is achieved, and improvement in transfer accuracy of a circuit pattern can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> When the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment is applied to the CMP step, reduction of defects such as disconnection in a multi-layered interconnection structure can be realized by high-level flattening of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the CMP step.
