<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention concerns a device for injecting a product towards a predetermined site of objects continuously moving along a given path while being spaced apart from one another by a specific step. The invention is characterized in that the device (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) comprises a series of injectors (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) borne by a mobile support (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) while being spaced apart on the support by a pitch corresponding to that of the objects, and the support (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) is driven in a reciprocating movement such that, during a forward phase of the movement, the injectors (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) move each opposite the predetermined site of one of the objects, and in the time interval of the reciprocating movement of the support is equal to the time interval between the passage of two consecutive objects in front of a common fixed point, multiplied by the number of injectors on the support. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention more particularly concerns facilities for manufacturing and/or processing and/or filling hollow bodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> By way of example, the invention will be described within the scope of a facility for manufacturing and/or filling containers made of thermoplastic material. More particularly, the device according to the invention will be described within the scope of a machine for manufacturing polyethylene terephtalate (PET) bottles in which the bottles are obtained by blow-molding a preform that has first been produced by injection molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In such facilities, it is often necessary, at one point or another in the process of manufacturing, processing or filling, to inject a product into a hollow body. For example, in a bottle manufacturing or filling unit, this product can be a sterilizing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> These facilities generally operate continuously, the hollow bodies all following the same path in the facility, moving continuously one after the other. This continuous nature of the movement of the hollow bodies poses a problem with respect to injecting into each hollow body a product such as a sterilizing agent. Indeed, there are generally two solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to one of these solutions, the simplest one, the product is injected by a nozzle placed in each hollow body when the hollow body in question passes in front of the nozzle. However, in high speed facilities, the length of time the hollow body is in front of the nozzle is extremely short, making it difficult to spray a sufficient amount of product under good spraying conditions, particularly when it is desired to ensure a good distribution of the product injected into the hollow body. In order to inject the desired amount of product, the flow rate of product must be increased, with the consequent loss of good control of the jet. The spray could also be begun early and its ending delayed, at the risk of part of the product not being injected into the hollow body, which causes wastage of product and fouling of the outside of the hollow body and the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another solution would consist of using a specific machine similar to a rotary filling machine. However, the cost of such a solution would be much too high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A purpose of the invention, therefore, is to propose a new design of an injection device that is simple and reliable, and which allows a product to be injected into a moving hollow body, the conditions of injection of the product being perfectly controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To that end, the invention proposes a device for injecting a product toward a predetermined location of objects that are moving continuously along a given path while being spaced from each other at a specific distance, characterized in that the device has a series of injectors that are carried by a movable support while being spaced on the support at a distance corresponding to that of the objects, in that the support is driven in a reciprocal movement so that, during an outbound phase of the movement the injectors are each moved in front of the predetermined location of one of the objects, and in that the period of the reciprocal movement of the support is equal to the time interval between the passage of two consecutive objects before a same fixed point, multiplied by the number of injectors on the support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to other characteristics of the invention: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> during the outbound phase of the movement, the injectors are moved parallel to and at the same speed as the objects; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> the reciprocal movement of the support has, in addition to the outbound phase, a return phase during which the movement is in the reverse direction, and two reversal phases; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> the duration of the four phases of movement are of the same order of magnitude; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> all along the reciprocal movement, the path of the injectors remains parallel to the path of the objects; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> the path of the injectors is in an arc of circle; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> the device has a transfer wheel that is driven in continuous rotational movement around its axis and on which are loaded the objects along one part of their path, and the injectors follow a path in an arc of circle around the same axis; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> the reciprocal movement of the movable support is controlled by a system having a movable cam and a cam follower connected to the support; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> the cam is a rotary cam that is driven in continuous rotational movement; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> the cam is driven in a continuous rotational movement around an axis parallel to the axis of rotation of the support; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> the cam has the form of a plate the contour of which forms the cam path; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> the cam follower is pressed against the cam by elastic return means; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> the device has a second cam that cooperates with a second cam follower connected to the support, and the profiles of the two cams are complementary so as to ensure positive control of the support in both directions of its reciprocal movement; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> at least one of the two cam followers has elastic means suitable for compensating for the geometric imperfections of the device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> it has a plate in which a track is formed with two parallel edges in which a roller moves that is connected to the support and which can cooperate with each of the edges of the track, these two edges each forming a cam path to ensure positive control of the support in both directions of its travel; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> the cam is driven in rotation by the transfer wheel through a reduction gear; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> the objects are hollow bodies having one opening; and </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The invention will be described within the scope of a device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for injecting a sterilizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or peracetic acid (APA) inside performs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> intended to be manufactured into PET bottles. The performs are hollow bodies produced by injection molding. These are generally appreciably tubular in shape and have one close end and one open end. The open end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is intended to form the open neck of the final container, is generally produced directly in its final form in the injection mold, and has, for example, threading <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and an external radial collar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In many bottle manufacturing facilities, the preforms are transported to the stretch blow molding machine by a positive transfer system in which the preforms continuously follow a defined path while being spaced from each other at a determined rate. This positive transfer system has, for example, a wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with recesses that is driven in continuous rotation around its appreciably vertical axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has, at its periphery, twenty semicircular recesses <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the diameter of which is appreciably equal to that of the preforms. In a known way, the preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are placed on the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a loading point so that each is received into a recess, and so that each is supported by its collar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Downstream from the point of loading, a guide <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in an arc of circle of axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> extends around the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to form another support area for the preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to prevent them from escaping the recesses <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Thus, while the preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are on the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, they follow a path in an arc of circle around the axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, up to the point of unloading at which they leave the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to continue being transferred by other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In a bottle manufacturing facility, this type of wheel with recesses can be, for example, positioned between a preform feed device and a temperature conditioning oven in which the preforms are brought up to a temperature at which they can be blow-molded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to the principles of the invention, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has several injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that are carried by a movable support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In the example illustrated, there are five injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> carried by a plate-like support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that is movable in rotation around the axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and which is positioned above the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. On the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are positioned on an arc of circle around the axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the diameter of which corresponds to the diameter of the wheel with recesses, and they are spaced from each other along this arc at a distance corresponding to the distance separating two consecutive recesses <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the wheel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> &lsqb;sic&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As a result, depending on the relative angular positions of the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> around the axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the five injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can inject the product into five preforms carried by the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is controlled in an alternating rotational movement around the axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the control of the movement being such that, during at least one phase of this movement, the injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> exactly follow the transport movement of the preforms that are carried on the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the example illustrated, the alternating movement of the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is controlled by a system of two cams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thus, the device has a first cam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the form of a plate with a contour that forms a cam path. The cam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is designed to be driven in rotation around a central axis A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which, in the example illustrated, is parallel to the axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> but different therefrom. The movable support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a first cam follower <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the form of a roller, for example, and which is designed to roll along the edge of the first cam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The first cam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is designed to be driven in rotation by the same shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that drives the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with recesses, by means of a pair of gears <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that are sized so that the cam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> turns twice as fast around its axis A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> around its axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the directions of rotation being opposite to each other. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the cam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is symmetrical around its axis A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the sense that two points of the edge of the plate that are diametrically opposite with respect to the axis A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are situated at an equal distance from the axis A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The cam follower <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is designed to remain permanently pressed against the cam path formed by the edge of the first cam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This could be accomplished by a system of elastic recall, for example a spring placed between the movable support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a fixed element of the frame to force the roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> against the cam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the example illustrated, it was preferred to provide a second cam <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which is integral with the first cam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, that has a profile that is complementary to the first cam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and which is designed to cooperate with a second cam follower <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> connected to the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The second cam <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is therefore also driven in rotation around the axis A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the profile of this second cam also being symmetrical with respect to the axis A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is useful, in order to take into account the dimensional tolerances related to the manufacture and assembly of the device, for the second cam follower <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> not to be rigidly connected to the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Thus, the second cam follower <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is carried at one end of a lever <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is mounted in rotation by its other end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on the movable support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The axis of rotation A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the lever <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with respect to the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is parallel to the axes A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The lever <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has a projection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on which is mounted a stop finger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that can slide along its axis A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with respect to the projection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. However, this sliding possibility is limited and the finger is pushed toward a rest position by a stack of Belleville type elastic washers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. This finger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is intended to press against a stop surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, this surface being positioned on the support so as to force the second cam follower <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> against the second cam <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this way, the action of the second cam <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> forces the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in a direction opposite to that of the first cam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the two cams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the two cam followers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are arranged in such a way that they are each forced against the cam followers, so that the angular position of the movable support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is always perfectly defined, regardless of the angular position of the two cams. The sliding finger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the elastic washers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> make it possible to eliminate backlash during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The two-cam system can also be replaced by a system having a single cam in the form of a plate in one face of which a closed loop groove would be hollowed out. The groove would have two opposite parallel edges that would allow a cam follower connected to the support to be guided in both directions of the reciprocal movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the choice was made for the cams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to have an axis of rotation A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> parallel to but different from the axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of rotation of the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This arrangement makes it possible to use a particularly simple system to drive the cams. As a variation, however, a rotary cam with the same axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> could be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The operation of the device described above will now be explained, with reference to the diagrams in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>F. These diagrams illustrate the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with recesses, and on this wheel, two series <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of preforms engaged in consecutive recesses of the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Of course, the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is driven in continuous rotation around its axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in this instance in the counterclockwise direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> corresponds to an angular position of the cams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> around their axis A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for which the support is in one extreme position. With respect to the direction of rotation of the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and therefore to the direction of movement of the preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> carried by the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, this position will be deemed to be the extreme upstream position. This extreme upstream position corresponds to a point of reversal of the reciprocal movement of the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the speed of the support at this point being zero. In this position, the first series of preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is offset in the upstream direction compared to the injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> carried by the support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has pivoted twenty degrees in the counterclockwise direction with respect to the extreme upstream position. By the arrangement of the gears <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the cams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> have turned around the axis A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by an angle twice as large, and in the opposite direction. It will be noted that the two cam followers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are each in contact with the cam with which they are respectively associated. In this position, the five injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> carried by the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are exactly in line with the five preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first series. This means that, between the positions of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, the preforms have &ldquo;caught up with&rdquo; the injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In effect, this phase of the movement of the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> corresponds to a progressive acceleration of the support from a speed of zero to an angular speed appreciably equal to the speed of the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The position of the support illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> marks the beginning of a tracking phase during which, for a certain period of time, the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> have appreciably the same speed. In this way, all along this phase of the movement, the injectors are moved so as to be placed just above the preforms in order to inject a product into them. This tracking phase continues up to the end-of-tracking position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, in which the injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are still in line with the preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, even though these preforms have continued their movement connected to the rotation of the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The duration of this tracking phase can be adjusted as needed, of course, by an appropriate design of the cams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference> illustrates the extreme downstream position of the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Between the positions of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</cross-reference>, the support has progressively slowed so that, in the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference> it has zero speed. In effect, the preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first series are now offset toward the downstream position with respect to the series of injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. This position therefore corresponds to a second point of reversal of the reciprocating movement of the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Between <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5D</cross-reference>, the support is driven in rotation essentially as a result of the first cam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which tends to push the first cam follower <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to make the support pivot in the counterclockwise direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Starting in the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>D and up to the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>F, it is the second cam <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that, by means of the second cam follower <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, causes the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to return to its extreme downstream position as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</cross-reference>. During the return, the support first undergoes a progressive acceleration, then a progressive deceleration to arrive at its extreme downstream position at which it has zero speed. At that moment, the second series of preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>occupies, with respect to the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the same position as the preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first series in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Between these two positions, the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has made one fourth of a turn, which corresponds to five times the angular spacing between two successive recesses. In other words, the length of time that separates the passage of the support from its position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>F, which corresponds to one period of reciprocal movement of the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, is therefore equal to the time required for five preforms to pass in front of a fixed point in their trajectory on the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The cams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> have made one half turn during that same time, and because their profile has a central symmetry with respect to the axis A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the operation of the device can then be continued in a way similar to what was described above, the injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> then tracking with the preforms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second series. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As a result of the device according to the invention, there is sufficient spraying time, without stopping or slowing the preforms, while the preforms are being processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the example illustrated, the length of the outbound stage of the movement, which corresponds to the time during which the product can be sprayed in the moving objects, only represents about one fourth to one third of the total time of one complete cycle of movement. Of course, by an appropriate design of the cams, this ratio could easily be varied, but as it is, it makes it possible to have reversal stages that do not impose sudden changes of speed on the support. This advantage assumes that the durations of the outbound stages and return stages of the movement are of the same order of magnitude, that is, the ratio between the duration of the stage and the shortest duration is less than 10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As can be seen, the amplitude of the reciprocating movement of the support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is relatively limited, so the injectors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be fed with product by a fixed tank attached to the injectors by one or more flexible lines. Such an arrangement is therefore much simpler that a rotary distributor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described within the particular scope of spraying a sterilizing product into a preform intended for the manufacture of containers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> It is evident, however, that the invention can be used in other applications. Thus, a device incorporating the principles of the invention can be used for </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> processing other objects, such as bottle stoppers. It can also be used to process other predetermined locations of an object, for example such as the outer threaded part of the neck of a preform or bottle. </paragraph>
