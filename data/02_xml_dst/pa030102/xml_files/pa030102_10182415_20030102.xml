<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> It is common practice to pack perishable goods in an evacuated bag of synthetic plastics material. There are two widely used procedures for evacuating and then sealing a bag. In the first procedure the packed but open bag is placed in a chamber with its open mouth lying on an anvil. The lid of the chamber is closed and this brings a heatable sealer bar into close proximity with the upper face of the bag. The chamber is evacuated and hence the bag flattens. Once the pressure in the chamber has fallen to a pre-set pressure, the sealer bar moves down towards the anvil. The bag is gripped between the anvil and the sealer bar and then current is supplied to a wire running along the sealer bar to weld the two walls of the bag together along a line adjacent the bag&apos;s mouth. The sealer bar moves away from the bag and anvil, the pressure in the chamber is allowed to rise to atmospheric and the lid is opened so that the evacuated and sealed bag can be removed from the chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This procedure is initiated by pressing a start button once the lid is closed and the procedure which follows is fully automatic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A disadvantage of this type of vacuum sealer is that the entire volume of the chamber must be evacuated regardless of the volume of the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The second common method employs a vacuum sealer which has an anvil of resilient material and a sealer bar which can be lowered to grip the mouth region of the bag between itself and the anvil. A vacuum pipe passes between the anvil and sealer bar and enters the bag. Pneumatic cylinders press the sealer bar against the anvil and the sealer bar itself presses the part of the pipe which is between the anvil and sealer bar into the resilient material of the anvil. The air in the bag is sucked out through the pipe. Thereafter the pipe is withdrawn from the bag and from between the anvil and the sealer bar. The space left by the pipe as it withdraws is immediately closed-up by the material of the anvil which expands resiliently to fill the space and maintain the mouth of the bag sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Power is then applied to the resistance wire of the sealer bar to weld the two faces of the bag together and form the seal which closes the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Unless care is taken to place the inlet end of the pipe close to the product being packed, the bag can be sucked onto the pipe inlet end. Once the pipe inlet end is obstructed the time taken to evacuate the bag increases and a poor vacuum is obtained, there usually being residual air left in the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In another form an internally ribbed bag is used, the ribbing being intended to provide a series of channels which prevent the bag being sucked closed thereby inhibiting withdrawal of air from the bag. Such bags are expensive and the vacuum sealers that they operate with cannot be used on inexpensive bags comprising two juxtaposed films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to provide a vacuum sealer which does not have the disadvantages set out above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a vacuum sealer which comprises a base plate onto which a bag of synthetic plastics material to be evacuated and sealed can be placed, a flexible flap which can be displaced from a position in which it lies on the base plate and a lifted position in which it is clear of the base plate, a heating element for forming a seal to close the bag, and a port through which a vacuum pump can be connected to the space between the base plate and the lowered flap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a vacuum sealer which comprises a base plate onto which a bag to be evacuated and sealed can be placed, a port in said base plate for connection to a source of suction so that air can be drawn from above the base plate through said port, a flexible flap having a raised position in which it is clear of the base plate and a lowered position in which it lies on the base plate to confine a bag receiving space between itself and the base plate, elongate sealing means between the flap and the base plate for forming an elongate weld line across an evacuated bag to seal its mouth closed, and a groove in said base plate running transversely of said elongate means, said groove being in communication with said vacuum port. The base plate can have one or more grooves in it into which the lower film of a bag being evacuated is sucked thereby to leave one or more channels between said lower film and an upper film of the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A separator in the form of a plate which is fixed along one edge can be provided, the separator being spaced from and overlying the base plate whereby a bag can be positioned with one film of the bag above the separator and below the flap, and the other film of the bag between the separator and the base plate and overlying the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Said sealing means is preferably an anvil carried on the underside of said flap and an electrically conductive wire carried by said base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a specified form said wire is carried by a sealer bar which is in slot of said base plate, said bar being secured to a diaphragm which divides a chamber into two compartments, an upper compartment communicating with said groove through said slot and a lower compartment being connectable selectively to a source of vacuum or to atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a preferred form the flap is fixed along one edge and has a stiffening frame along its other edges.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The vacuum sealer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> comprises a base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is rectangular in plan view and has a sealer bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> mounted on the top surface thereof. A port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided in the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the port being connected to a vacuum pump (not shown) by a vacuum pipe (not shown). The power supply leads to the heating wire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sealer bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> pass through the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from below and are diagrammatically shown at L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Along the rear edge of the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> ( the right hand edge in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) there is a fastening strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is secured to the base plate by a row of fastening elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. One edge of a rectangular flexible flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of, for example, Neoprene is secured by the strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and studs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is large enough to cover the entire area of the top surface of the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An anvil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the form of a &ldquo;Teflon&rdquo; strip is secured to the underside of the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In use the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is lifted away from the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the position shown in dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to enable a packed bag B to be placed on the base plate. The bag B is closed along three sides and has an open mouth at M. The bag is placed so that the sealer bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> runs across the bag B parallel to, and adjacent, the open mouth M. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then pulled back to a position in which it overlies the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the bag B lying on it. Because the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is flexible it takes up a position in which it closely follows the contours of the bag and its contents and lies against the base plate around the bag. The mouth region of the bag is now trapped between the sealer bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and strip <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The vacuum pump is then actuated and air is drawn out of the thin space between the top face of the base plate and the flap. Because the flap has been allowed to fall onto the base plate and the filled bag and takes up a closely conforming shape, the volume of air trapped between the flap and the base plate is small. Thus evacuation of what little air there is a quick procedure thereby speeding up the cycle time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Once the bag has been evacuated the wire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has current supplied there to heat it and form the seal. It will be understood that atmospheric pressure presses the strip <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> against the sealer bar and that the pneumatic cylinders conventionally used for this purpose are not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> At the end of the pre-set period during which the wire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is supplied with current, the port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is opened to atmosphere to release the vacuum. The flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can then be lifted to enable the evacuated and sealed bag to be removed and the next cycle started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Experimental work has shown that it is possible in some circumstances for the mouth of the bag to be sucked closed at the beginning of air evacuation thereby trapping air in the bag and resulting in a poor vacuum. To avoid this a bar <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can span across the base plate between the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the base plate. The bar <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in the upper position illustrated, prevents the flap pressing down on the mouth region of the bag and closing it prematurely. Just before the end of the evacuation portion of the sealing cycle the bar <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> moves to the lower position illustrated in dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is sucked down onto the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shown as deforming to a curving shape when it is in the lifted position (shown in dotted lines). This simple form can be used if the flap and base are relatively large compared with the dimensions of the bag. Even though the bag underneath the flap deforms it the edges of the flap still fall flat on the base plate. However, if the bag is relatively large compared with the flap and base plate, then the distortions caused by the bag can reach the edge of the flap as ridges. The gap below the ridges prevent sealing taking place. To prevent this a frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be provided. This extends along the three sides of the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which are not connected to the strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The part of the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is parallel to the strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown on the left hand side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the sealing structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> the sealer bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is secured to one side of a diaphragm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The diaphragm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> divides a chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into two compartments <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The compartment <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> communicates with the space under the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the compartment <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the suction side of the pump. The heating wire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> runs along the bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The shape of the diaphragm is such that it adopts the illustrated position in which the sealer bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is lowered when the pressures in the compartments <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed with at least one groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which extends the full width of the base plate from the port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to a position close to that edge of the base plate which is remote from strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. There can be a number of parallel grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> the anvil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is on the underside of the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> the anvil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the form of a strip is mounted on two columns <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), the columns <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> being in sockets <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the base plate. Springs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> push the columns <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and anvil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> upwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a thicker edge zone which provides a raised platform <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in a slot <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which opens through the top surface of the platform <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The compartment <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> communicates with the groove through the slot <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the vacuum cycle starts, both compartments <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are evacuated. The diaphragm <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> holds the sealer bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the retracted position shown. At the end of the evacuation cycle the compartment <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to atmosphere so that the sealer bar <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is pushed up against the underside of the bag. Sealing then takes place by feeding current to the wire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to heat it. The vacuum under the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> If reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> this diagrammatically illustrates the groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a film F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constituting the lower wall of the bag, and a film F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> constituting the upper wall of the bag. Experimental work has shown that the lower film F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is sucked into the groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as diagrammatically illustrated. The film F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> stretches somewhat and shifts somewhat with respect to film F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Because the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> presses on film F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the film F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has less freedom of movement than film F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Hence it tends not to follow film F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the groove(s) and thus one or more channels C remain which run to the bottom of the bag. Thus the bag films F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> do not suck into such close proximity as to close-off the bag leaving air trapped inside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> To enable bags of greater volume to be handled, the part of the base plate which is to the right of the platform <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be in the form of a resiliently flexible sheet. A filled bag placed on it creates a depression in the sheet in which the bag lies. Thus only a part of the bag protrudes above the level of the flexible sheet, and this reduces the size of the hump that must be created in the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when it is lowered onto the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the vacuum sealer illustrated comprises many features which are also found in the sealers of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Where applicable the same reference numerals have been used with the addition of the suffix &ldquo;0.1&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In this form there is a hinge <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> one leaf of which is mounted on the strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the other leaf of which is mounted on a plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The sealing wire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mounted on the underside of the plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in this form does not overlie the entire bag but only extends a short way beyond the free edge of the plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The advantage of this form is that the contents of the bag can be seen, and collapse of the bag as it evacuates can be watched. The flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> extends the full width of the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or across sufficient of the width of the plate to cover the entire bag. If a visible bag is not a required feature then the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can extend over the whole area of the base plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The groove <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> ensures that a passageway into the bag is maintained open during evacuation there to ensure that the bag is totally evacuated. The sequence of operations is as described above in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A gripping handle, shown diagrammatically at <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, can be provided for lifting the plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and hence the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not extend over the filled part of the bag, it does not require a frame around three of its edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The vacuum sealer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> differs from that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> in that the flap, designated <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, covers the entire area of the base plate, designated <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and is carried by a rectangular frame <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In this form the plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fixed to the strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and not connected to it-by a hinge. The frame is mounted so that it can pivot, as shown by the arrows A, to lift the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> away from the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be fixed to the underside of a dome-like cover <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which is provided purely for aesthetic purposes. It will be understood that only the space under the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is evacuated and not the space, under the cover <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> ensures that all three unattached edges of the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> lie flat on the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> parts which are also found in earlier Figures have been designated with like reference numerals with the addition of the suffix &ldquo;0.3&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In this form a separator <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the form of a thin plate having a castellated edge (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) to provide fingers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is mounted on a strip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which is close to the strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Once the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has been lifted, the separator <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is inserted into the bag by sliding the bag to the left as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. This separates the bottom film F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the top film F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and holds the mouth of the bag open. When vacuum is applied to the space under the flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the film Fl is sucked into the groove <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As will be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, there are vacuum ports <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in addition to the port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Vacuum applied via these ports sucks the lower film F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> against the base plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and prevents inadvertent movement of the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the separator <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is intended to be inserted into the bag to separate the films F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, experimental work has shown that even if both films F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the bag are inserted below the separator (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) satisfactory evacuation and sealing occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The flap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> does not require a frame as it does not cover the filled part of the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the form of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> there is a protrusion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> running from front to rear on the separator <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. This protrusion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> presses the film F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, or both films F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, into the groove <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The dimensions of the protrusion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are insufficient to hold the films F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in face-to-face contact and close off the passageway leading into the bag. </paragraph>
