<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a cut line forming method for forming a plurality of cut lines of a predetermined length in a sheet made of paper, a nonwoven fabric, a film, a composite of a nonwoven fabric and a film, a composite of a nonwoven fabric and a fibrous web, a composite of a film and a fibrous web, a composite of a film, a nonwoven fabric and a fibrous web, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description if the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the general method for forming the cut lines of a predetermined length in those various sheets, both a cutter roll having a plurality of cutting blades protruded intermittently on the outer circumference for setting the length of the cut lines and an anvil roll having a receiving face for the cutting blades on the outer circumference are used and fed at the clearance inbetween with the sheet and are then turned. During these turns, the sheet is bitten and cut between the cutting blades and the receiving face so that the cut lines having the same length as that of the cutting blades are formed in a plurality of portions of the sheet. The term &ldquo;cut line&rdquo; as used herein is meant to indicate a slit, i.e., a long narrow cut which pass through the sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the cut line forming method of the prior art, however, the length of the edges of the cutting blades of the cutter roll (i.e., the linear length of the edges extending in a roll axis direction) is equalized to the length of the cut lines to be formed in the sheet, and the cutting blades are arrayed at an interval on the outer circumference of the cutter roll. With the edges thus being short, the individual cutting blades are weakened so that they are liable to be worn at their edges and to be folded or broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When intermittent cut lines, as arrayed obliquely with respect to the MD, are to be formed in a bulky sheet which is prepared by laying a layer of long fibers opened from TOW or a layer of split yarns over a base material sheet of a nonwoven fabric, for example, to have a basis weight of 50 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or more, on the other hand, an offset force in a widthwise direction (CD) is applied to the layer of long fibers or split yarns by the cutting blades extending obliquely with respect to the circumferential direction of the cutter roll. As a result, there will arise a problem that the fiber layer is offset over the sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As the cutter roll and the anvil roll are turned to form the cut lines, on the other hand, one cutting blade is pressed many times by the receiving face. As a result, the edges of the cutting blades are seriously worn. Moreover, the receiving face of the anvil roll is hit many times at the same portions by the cutting blades so that the receiving face is also seriously damaged or worn. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to provide a method for forming cut lines in a sheet, which is enabled to prevent the cutting blades from being worn, folded or broken, by making the length of the edges of the cutting blades (i.e., the linear length of the edges extending in the roll axis direction and/or in the roll circumference direction) larger than that of the cut lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a cut line forming method which makes it hard for an offset force to act on the fibrous layer on the sheet by arranging the cut lines in a V-shaped array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the invention is to provide a cut line forming method which is enabled to elongate the life time of the edges of the cutting blades by shifting the portions of the edges to abut against the receiving faces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a cut line forming method comprising: using a cutter roll having cutting blades protruded on its outer circumference and an anvil roll for receiving the cutting blades; feeding a sheet into the clearance between the cutter roll and the anvil roll; and turning the rolls individually to form cut lines in the sheet, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> wherein the cutting blades of the cutter roll are formed into a shape of letter &ldquo;V&rdquo;, and the anvil roll has receiving faces of a predetermined width formed at an interval in a roll axis direction, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> wherein the cutter roll is turned to direct the crests of the V-shape of the cutting blades forward of the turning direction thereby to advance cuts from the side of the crests of the V-shape so that cut lines corresponding to the width size of the receiving faces may be intermittently formed in the sheet along the V-shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the invention, the length of the edges of the cutting blades of the cutter roll (i.e., the length of the edges extending in the roll axis direction and/or in the roll circumference direction) is not reduced, but the receiving faces for receiving the cutting blades are made to have a predetermined width size, so that the cut lines of the length corresponding to the width size of the receiving faces can be formed when the sheet is pressed and cut by the cutting blades and the receiving faces. This makes it unnecessary to shorten the edges of the cutting blades so that the cutting blades can be less worn and can be prevented from being folded or broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the invention, when the obliquely arrayed cut lines are to be formed in a bulky sheet which is prepared by laying a layer of long fibers opened from the TOW or a layer of split yarns over a base material of a nonwoven fabric or a film to have a basis weight of 50 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or more and which is liable to be dispersed in the basis weight in the widthwise direction, for example, the cut lines are arrayed in the V-shaped pattern, and the abutting portions between the cutting blades and the receiving faces are advanced from the crests to the skirts of the V-shape. As the two rolls turn, therefore, substantially homogeneous forces act to the right and left in the widthwise direction (CD) upon the sheet at the layer of the long fibers or the layer of the split yarns across the crests of the V-shape. As a result, no extremely widthwise offset force will act on the layer of the long fibers or the like of the sheet so that the layer of the long fibers or the like is hardly offset or dispersed in the bulk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Here, the V-shaped pattern of the cutting blades in the invention may be to have an acute angle or a rounded shape at the crest. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, moreover, the trailing end portion of the skirts of the V-shape of one cutting blade and the crest of the V-shape of another cutting blade preferably lie on a common line in the roll axis direction. With the crest of the V-shape being given the acute angle and laid on the common line, the pressure on the cutting blades can be easily made constant when the cutting blades abut against the receiving faces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a cut line forming method comprising: using a cutter roll having cutting blades protruded on its outer circumference and an anvil roll for receiving the cutting blades; feeding a sheet into the clearance between the cutter roll and the anvil roll; and turning the rolls individually to form cut lines in the sheet, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> wherein the anvil roll has receiving faces of a predetermined width formed at an interval in a roll axis direction, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> wherein the receiving faces are formed to shift in the roll axis direction in accordance with the advance in the circumferential direction, so that the abutting portions of the cutting blades against the receiving faces may shift along the edges of the cutting blades at the next time when the cutting blades and the receiving faces abut against each other, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> wherein as the cutter roll and the anvil roll turn, the cut lines corresponding to the width size of the receiving faces are formed in the sheet and are arrayed at an interval in the extending direction of the receiving faces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this case, the receiving faces may be formed in a helical shape on the circumference of the anvil roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a cut line forming method comprising: using a cutter roll having cutting blades protruded on its outer circumference and an anvil roll for receiving the cutting blades; feeding a sheet into the clearance between the cutter roll and the anvil roll; and turning the rolls individually to form cut lines in the sheet, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> wherein the anvil roll has receiving faces of a predetermined width formed at an interval in a roll axis direction, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> wherein the cutting blades are formed to shift in the roll axis direction in accordance with the advance in the circumferential direction, so that the abutting portions of the cutting blades against the receiving faces may shift along the edges of the cutting blades at the next time when the cutting blades and the receiving faces abut against each other, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> wherein as the cutter roll and the anvil roll turn, the cut lines corresponding to the width size of the receiving faces are formed in the sheet and are arrayed at an interval in the extending direction of the cutting blades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In this case, the cutting blades may be formed in a helical shape on the circumference of the cutter roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the second or third aspect of the invention, the receiving faces of the predetermined width shift in the roll axis direction as they extend in the circumferential direction of the anvil roll, or the cutting blades shift in the roll axis direction as they extend in the circumferential direction of the cutter roll. As a result, when the edges of the cutting blades extend continuously, for example, the abutting portions of the cutting blades against the receiving faces shift in the edge extending direction as the abutments are repeated. Therefore, the cutting blades can be prevented from abutting against the receiving faces exclusively at their identical portions, thereby to elongate the edge lifetime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the invention, the diametrical size of the cutter roll to the edges of the cutting blades is preferably made different from that of the receiving faces of the anvil roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With the cutter roll and the anvil roll being thus diametrically different, the cutting blades and the receiving faces can be prevented from abutting at their identical positions so that they can be less worn to elongate their lifetimes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the hardness of the receiving faces of the anvil roll is preferably lower than that of the cutting blades of the cutter roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In this case, while the cutting work is continued for a long time, the receiving faces are more easily worn or damaged than the cutting blades. However, the wear or damage of the receiving faces, as formed on the outer circumference of the anvil roll, can be easily remedied by the simple method of polishing the receiving faces while turning the anvil roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The sheet to be cut in the invention is, for example, made of paper, a nonwoven fabric, a film, a composite of a nonwoven fabric and a film, a composite of a nonwoven fabric and a fibrous web, a composite of a film and a fibrous web, or a composite of a film, a nonwoven fabric and a fibrous web. However, the invention should not be limited to the cutting of these sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The invention is especially effective where the cut lines are to be formed in the sheet of which the fibrous web is a layer of long fibers such as fibers opened from TOW or split yarns so that it is bulky and is liable to be dispersed in the basis weight.</paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, in addition, it is preferable that the end portions of the open sides <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of any cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the crest <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of another cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> line on a common line L extending in the roll axis direction. With this construction, it is possible to keep the contact pressure between the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> always at a constant level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is arranged in parallel with the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and these anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are elastically pushed by the not-shown elastic push means. The anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided on its outer circumference with the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a predetermined width size W. The receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are linearly extended in the turning direction of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in the development of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, so that they are formed into the cylindrical faces which are extended to make one round in the turning direction of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The individual receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are separated by grooves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that they are spaced at a constant spacing d in the roll axis direction (CD) of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The width size W of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the roll axis direction is preferably 1 mm or more, and the spacing d of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the roll axis direction is preferably 0.5 mm or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown, the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as formed on the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, are formed into the V-shape and continuously without any interruption in the roll axis direction of the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, it should be noted that the individual cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the V-shape according to the invention may be interrupted at one or two or more portions midway of the roll axis direction. Accordingly, the term &ldquo;V-shape&rdquo; as used herein should not be construed to preclude such an uncontinuous V-shape which is interrupted midway. In this case, however, the extensions of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the roll axis direction (CD) are required to be longer than the width size W of one receiving face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the roll axis direction and to have a length sufficient for abutting against at least two adjoining receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the two rolls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are turned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fed to the clearance between the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it is delivered out in the MD by the turning forces of the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the direction a and the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the direction &bgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the construction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are continuous without any interruption in the roll axis direction of the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the predetermined width W are formed at the spacing d in the roll axis direction. Therefore, the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is cut only at portions where the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> abut. As a result, a plurality of cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are cut in the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are intermittently formed corresponding to the V-shape of the individual cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Hereinafter, the term &ldquo;V-shaped cut lines&rdquo; is meant to indicate a set of cut lines, which are intermittently formed corresponding to the V-shape of one cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The V-shaped cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are arranged at the spacing d in the roll axis direction with such a width extending in the roll axis direction (CD) as is equalized to the width size W of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The V-shaped cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> never fail to include one cut line forming the crest <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the V-shape. In other words, one of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned to abut against the crests <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the V-shaped cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The remaining cut lines of the V-shaped cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are intermittently arranged to form the slope portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>expanded backward of the MD from the crests <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the open end portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the V-shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the crests <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the V-shaped cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are directed forward (i.e., in the direction &agr;) of the turning direction. In the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, therefore, the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are so extended that their cuts advance from the crests <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the open end portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the V-shape. When the slope portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are to be formed, forces F outward of the width direction (CD) are caused to act on the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the slope portions of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> extending obliquely. However, these forces F act substantially homogeneously to the right and left or outward of the widthwise direction across the crests <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the V-shape so that neither any offset force nor any widthwise centralized force acts on the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. What acts on the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is the widthwise tensions which are caused by the forces F and F directed homogeneously to the right and left. Therefore, the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is cut without any deformation by the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are regularly formed without any distortion or any displacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Especially where the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has the following construction, the homogeneous forces F and F are applied to eliminate the offset or concentration of a fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this construction, for example, the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is manufactured by laying the fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as made of long fibers such as fibers opened from TOW or split yarns, over a base material of nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, film or a composite of the nonwoven fabric and the film, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, so that it is bulky to have a basis weight of 50 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or more but is liable to vary in the basis weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, moreover, the diameter of a virtual cylinder containing the edges of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is different from that of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> abut less repeatedly against the same portions of the confronting receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that they abut against different portions of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned. As a result, the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are hardly worn or damaged at their local portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are made of a less hard material than that of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are worn before the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after the cutting actions are repeated for a long time. This makes it possible to delay the progress of the wear of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The wear or damage on the surfaces of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be remedied at a simple step by turning the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to grind the surfaces of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a top plan view showing a cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A as an example of the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in which the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are formed by the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a section taken along line IV-IV of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> This cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A is manufactured by laying the fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> over the base material or the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is exemplified by spun-bonded, thermal bonded, or spun-lace nonwoven fabric containing fusible fibers such as those of PET, PE or PP or their composite fibers. Alternatively, the base material may be exemplified either by a fusible film in place of the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or by a laminate of the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a fibrous layer made of long fibers such as fibers opened from the TOW or split yarns. These fibers are extended mainly in the delivery direction (MD) of the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A. The long fibers such as fibers opened from the TOW or split yarns may be extended as long as the entire length of the cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A in the MD, or the fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be formed of bundles of fibers shorter than the entire length in the MD. The fibers making the fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also contain the fusible fibers such as those of PET, PE or PP or their composite fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> On the two side portions of the cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A lying opposite one another in the widthwise direction (CD), there are disposed holding sheets <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. These holding sheets <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are made of a sheet similar to the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the holding sheets <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> sandwich the two side portions of the fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and are adhered with a hot-melt adhesive or fused to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In this cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, there are formed fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The individual fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are continuously extended in a shape of letter &ldquo;V&rdquo;, which is identical to the V-shape along which the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are arranged. By these fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are pressed and fused to each other. These fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed by feeding the sheet to the clearance between a heating roll having a V-shaped pressure portion on the surface and a receiving roll confronting the heating roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A thus having the fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fed into the clearance between the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the V-shaped cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are formed between the fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are cut together along those cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If necessary, moreover, the fibers composing the fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are napped. In hatched regions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, therefore, the fibers forming the fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are held by the fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> but released at the portion of the cut line <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. As a result, the cut fibers extending from the fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the cut line <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> form a brush-shaped portion. Such brush-shaped portions of the fibrous layer are formed in all the regions that are defined by the fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In this cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, the brush-shaped portions can wipe off dust or the like. In the remaining regions lacking the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the fibrous layer extends in a bridge shape between the fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adjoining in the MD so that it can trap the dust or relatively large pieces of trash between the fibers. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> is identical to the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> to have the generally V-shaped cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed at the constant interval in the turning direction (or in the direction a). The individual cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed continuously without any interruption in the roll axis direction (CD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> On the outer circumference of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, there are formed the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the predetermined width W and the grooves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for separating the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at the spacing d in the roll axis direction. The width size W of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the roll axis direction (CD) is preferably 1 mm or more, and the spacing d of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the roll axis direction (CD) is preferably 0.5 mm or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> However, the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are so formed at an angle of inclination &thgr; with respect to the circumferential direction that they may shift in the roll axis direction (CD) as they go in the circumferential direction (or in the turning direction, i.e., the direction &bgr;). In the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, more specifically, the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the predetermined width W are formed helical in the roll axis direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The inclination angle &thgr; is not especially limited if it exceeds 0 degrees. If this angle &thgr; is so set that the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are displaced by W&plus;d in the roll axis direction when the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A makes one turn, however, they form one helical line continuing in the circumferential direction of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A.

Therefore, the portions of the edges of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to abut against the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shift along the edges of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with the turns. For example, when the predetermined cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as indicated at (i) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, abuts against the receiving face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, the cut line <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed, as indicated at (ii) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. After this, when the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A turn so that the cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at (i) abuts against the receiving face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> once again, the abutting portion of the cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at (i) against the receiving face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shifts in the roll axis direction (CD) along the edge of the cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> For this action, it is necessary that the diameter of the virtual cylinder containing the edges of the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> be different from the diameter of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. With this diametrical difference, the portion of the receiving face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to receive the cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at (i) shifts in the circumferential direction as the turns of the rolls advance. The receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are inclined to shift in the roll axis direction as they move in the circumferential direction of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. Therefore, the abutting portion of the cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at (i) against the receiving face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shifts in the roll axis direction along the edge of the cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with the inclination (&thgr;) of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Between these sets of the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A, there are interposed fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A extending linearly in the CD to bond the nonwoven fabric and the fibrous web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The diameter of the virtual cylinder containing the edges of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A of the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, is made different from the diameter of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, and the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are inclined helically at the angle &thgr; with respect to the turning direction. As the two rolls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A turn, therefore, the abutting portions of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A against the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shift in the roll axis direction along the edges of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, and the abutting portions of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> against the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A also shift. Like the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, therefore, the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be prevented from being locally worn and damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the cleaning sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A are arrayed at a spacing in the direction which is inclined at the angle &thgr; with respect to the MD, i.e., in accordance with the extending direction of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In the regions defined between the fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A, moreover, the fibers cut by the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A are raised from the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> while having their root ends at the fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, to form the napped brush-shaped portions. In the regions having no cut line <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A, on the other hand, the fibrous layer extends in a bridge shape between the fused lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Here, the sheet in the invention should not be limited to the composite one of the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the fibrous web <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, but may be a composite sheet of nonwoven fabrics, a composite sheet of a film and a fibrous web or a film and a nonwoven fabric, a composite sheet of a film, a nonwoven fabric and a fibrous web, or a single layer sheet of a nonwoven fabric, a film or paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the purpose of forming the cut lines intermittently is not limited to the napping of the fibers as in the aforementioned cleaning sheet to form the brush-shaped portion. The cut lines may be used for another application such as perforated lines for opening envelopes or cut lines for making a film air-permeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A fourth embodiment to be used for forming the cut lines for such applications is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> is a development of a cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> is a development of an anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a top plan view of a sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D in which cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B are formed by the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B and the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are extended in the circumferential direction but at an inclination of angle &thgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>with respect to the circumferential direction. These cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B have a spacing d0 in the roll axis direction. The cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B form one helical line on the outer circumference of the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B if the angle &thgr;2 is so set that the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B shift by the spacing d0 in the roll axis direction when the cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B makes one turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A and grooves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B are formed alternately in the circumferential direction. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A and the grooves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B are formed at an inclination with respect to the roll axis direction but may be extended in parallel in the roll axis direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The cutter roll <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B and the anvil roll <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B are fed inbetween with the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D and are turned. Then, the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D is cut at the portions where the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B and the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A abut against each other. As a result, the plurality of cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B are formed in the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D. These cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B are arranged at the spacing d0 in the roll axis direction in accordance with the extending direction of the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A and are spaced in accordance with the extending direction of the edges of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the abutting portions of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B against the receiving faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A shift sequentially in the extending direction of the edges of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B as the two rolls turn. Especially with the two rolls having the different diameters, if the receiving face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A indicated at (iii) abuts against the cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B at one turn, when the receiving face <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A at (iii) abuts against the cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B once again at next turn, the abutting portion of the cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B against the receiving face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A at (iii) shifts in the extending direction of the edge of the cutting blade <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. Therefore, the cutting blades <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B can be prevented as much as possible from being locally worn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> may be exemplified by a sheet manufactured by laying a bulky nonwoven fabric over a base material of a nonwoven fabric or a film. With the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B being formed, the sheet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D is suited for a cleaning sheet because the dust or refuse can be easily trapped at the cut lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B between the base material and the nonwoven fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As has been described hereinbefore, according to the invention, the length of the cut lines is determined by the width size W of the receiving faces of the anvil roll so that the cutting blades of the cutter roll can be made longer than the cut lines. This makes it unnecessary unlike the prior art to provide the cutting blades having the short edges and makes it possible to elongate the lifetime of the cutting blades and to prevent the cutting blades from any damage or from being folded or broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> When the cut lines are formed in the V-shaped array, no offset force is applied to the sheet so that the V-shaped cut lines can be regularly formed without any distortion or displacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> When the receiving faces are extended obliquely with respect to the circumferential direction of the anvil roll, moreover, the abutting portions of the cutting blades against the receiving faces can be shifted along the edges of the cutting blades to prevent the cutting blades from being locally worn or damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, still moreover, the rolls can be given the simple structures and can be easily polished to lower the production cost and to shorten the manufacture period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Here, &ldquo;comprises/comprising&rdquo; when used in this specification is taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps or components but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Although various exemplary embodiments have been shown and described, the invention is not limited to the embodiments shown. Therefore, the scope of the invention is intended to be limited solely by the scope of the claims that follow. </paragraph>
