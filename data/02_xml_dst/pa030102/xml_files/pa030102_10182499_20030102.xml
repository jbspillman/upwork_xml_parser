<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> THIS INVENTION relates to a pivotal leg assembly for use on a sawhorse. Accordingly, the invention will be described in this context. However, it should be appreciated that the pivotal leg assembly may be used on other articles, such as tables, chairs, benches or the like. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Sawhorses are a common tool that is found on a building site. A standard sawhorse typically has a cross member with a pair of legs that is fixed to each end of the cross member. A brace often extends between each pair of legs to provide additional reinforcement to the legs. When a load is placed on the cross member, the brace prevents the legs splaying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Sawhorses are usually needed to be transported to and from different building sites and taken home each night by their owner. They are normally transported using a vehicle. An inherent problem with standard sawhorses is that they take up considerable space when placed within a vehicle. Standard sawhorses cannot be efficiently stacked on top of each other to reduce space. They are not very stable when placed in a normal operating position within the vehicle, as they often fall over or out of a vehicle when the vehicle travels around a corner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In an attempt to overcome some of the above disadvantages, collapsable sawhorses have been developed. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,296,834 discloses a sawhorse that has a pair of legs located at each end of a cross member. Each pair of legs is able to be pivoted toward each other so that they fold underneath the cross member. However, the legs are splayed after they are pivoted, causing the sawhorse to occupy a considerable amount of space. Further, each pair of legs has a brace that prevents sawhorses from being stacked on top of each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The sawhorses disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,880,080, 4,298,904 and 4,771,863 have similar stacking problems as they all have braces. Further, the exemplified collapsible sawhorses are relatively complex to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,052,517 discloses a cross member comprising a trapezoid core to which is attached two pair of legs. The legs are pivotal and are able to move adjacent the cross member when in a storage position. However, as the legs have no brace, then the legs may become splayed. Further, the trapezoid core prevents the sawhorse from being able to be staked. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to overcome or at least alleviate one or more of the above disadvantages or provide the consumer with a useful or commercial choice. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> show a sawhorse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising two pivotal leg assemblies <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> attached to a cross member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The cross member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a hollow channel section having a top stay <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with two depending side stays <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The cross member is made from laminated wood and has two slots <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> located in the top stay <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. A pair of holes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are located at each end of the top stay <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. On each side stay <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, there is an upper hole <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a lower hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Each pivotal leg assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a pair of legs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a mounting body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a locking mechanism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The legs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are tubular and rectangular when view in transverse cross-section. They are made from steel or other suitable materials. A hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is located through an end of the leg to pivotally mount the leg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The mounting body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a bridging member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, first support bracket <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and second support bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The bridging member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, first support bracket <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and second support bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are all constructed of high grade steel plate or other suitable high strength material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The first support bracket <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a first web <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> having two first depending side plates <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Holes <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are located within the first web and each first side plate.

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The sawhorse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assembled by attaching the lock body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to the bridging web <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> by placing fasteners <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through holes <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> located in both the lock body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and bridging web <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The locking mechanism is then completed by positioning the springs <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and bushes <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> within respective holes <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> located in the lock body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The handle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is fixed to the ends of the locking pins <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The springs <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are attached to respective locking pins <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> so that the locking pins <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are able to be reciprocated within the lock body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and biased so that the handle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> abuts against the lock body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The mounting body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is formed by placing the forward plates <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the bridging member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> over the first side plates <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the first bracket <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> so that respective holes <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the first side plates <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are in alignment with respective holes <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the forward plates <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The second web <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> of the second support bracket <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is positioned against the first web <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the first bracket so that the holes <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> located within each web <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> are in alignment. This causes the second flange <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> to abut and support the lock body <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
