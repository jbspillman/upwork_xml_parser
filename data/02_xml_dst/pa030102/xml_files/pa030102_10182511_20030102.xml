<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on a sawing tool for a hand circular power saw with two coaxial saw blades, which can be driven to counter-rotate in relation to each other, of the generic type defined in the preamble to claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Sawing tools of this kind have the advantage that during operation of the manually guided circular power saw, the reaction forces and reaction moments are eliminated by the counter-rotation of the two saw blades and the user can guide the machine with ease and with a low amount of reaction force. With continuous wear on the cutting edge, e.g. when the cutting corners with which the two saw blades travel past each other become rounded, the saw blades no longer rest snugly against each other and the material between the two saw blades is no longer completely removed so that a piece of material remains in the kerf. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a known sawing tool of the type mentioned at the beginning (WO 89/00474), the main cutting edges of the saw teeth are inclined in relation to the saw blade plane so that the corner edges of the main cutting edges situated further forward in the rotation direction of the saw blades are disposed on the blade sides of the saw blades that are oriented toward each other. As a result, the cutting force of the main cutting edges produces an axially oriented force component during sawing, which presses the serrated regions of the saw blades together in the cutting region so that the saw blades continue to rest snugly against each other even with increasing wear on the cutting edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Sawing tools of this kind, which are designed to hold the saw blades together in the kerf, have the disadvantage that the friction between the saw blades leads to relatively high friction losses that cause the saw blades to heat up a very rapidly. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The sawing tool according to the invention has the advantage that the material is cut jointly by two cutters that overlap each other in the kerf. As is the case in the prior sawing tools, the main cutters, which have the usual serrations comprised of a large number of main cutter teeth that support main cutting edges and secondary cutting edges, perform most of the sawing work, while the trimmer cuts only the piece remaining between the two saw blades. In the sawing tool according to the invention, the saw blades therefore no longer need to be deliberately held together, but can also operate with an axial distance between the main cutters, which does not cancel out the overlapping of the main cutting edges and the secondary cutting edges. The trimmer cuts away material that gets in between the main cutters. Because of the trimmer, the degree of wear on the two main cutters does not have much influence on whether a piece of material remains in the kerf, because the piece is cut away by the trimmer. Since the separation of the saw blades no longer presents a problem thanks to the presence of the trimmer, in the sawing tool according to the invention, the saw blades also do not have to be held together to an excessive degree in the kerf, which means that lower frictional losses are produced and the saw blade temperature remains low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Advantageous modifications and improvements of the sawing tool disclosed in claim 1 are possible by means of the steps taken in the remaining claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the trimmer has a large number of cutting edges, which are radially recessed in relation to the main cutting edges of the main cutter teeth and which have an axial width that is greater than the axial distance between the main cutter teeth on the two saw blades. In this embodiment of the trimmer, an optimal cutting result is assured even with extreme cutting edge wear on the main cutters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to a first embodiment of the invention, the radially recessed cutting edges of the trimmer are constituted by the secondary cutting edges of the main cutter teeth of the one saw blade, which are oriented toward the other saw blade and are inclined in relation to the blade plane so that their outer edge adjoining the main cutting edge is recessed into the saw blade plane and their inner edge on the other side projects from the saw blade plane, while the secondary cutting edges of the other saw blade, which are oriented toward the trimmer, are inclined parallel to them. In a new sawing tool, the secondary cutting edges of the two saw blades oriented toward each other travel past each other with almost no gap. If, for example, due wear on the cutting corners or due to a tolerance-induced gap between the saw blades, a piece of material remains uncut during the sawing operation, this is removed by the inclined secondary cutting edges, which thereby perform the function of a trimmer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the outer secondary cutting edges of the main cutter teeth of the saw blade, which are oriented away from the secondary cutting edges of the trimmer, are inclined so that the cutting corners that they form with the main cutting edges are recessed slightly from the saw blade plane. This inclination of the outer secondary cutting edges can absorb lateral forces produced in the trimmer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the trimmer has a large number of trimmer teeth, which each have a cutting edge and are arranged in equidistant succession in a circle concentric to the saw blade axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a preferred exemplary embodiment, the trimmer teeth are disposed on the one saw blade so that they project laterally from the blade plane and protrude into a blade recess embodied in the other saw blade, directly underneath its teeth. In this exemplary embodiment, the sharp cutting corners of the main cutting surfaces of the two saw blades are prevented from colliding with one another and causing malfunctions as a result of axial pressure on the saw blades or poor balance in the two saw blades due to unfavorable tolerances. Instead, when lateral forces occur, the side surfaces of the trimmer teeth travel against the bottom of the blade recess without being damaged and thus restrict the collision of the saw blades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the blade recess is embodied as an annular groove, which is concentric to the saw blade axis and is provided with a friction-reducing coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the trimmer teeth are disposed inside the teeth of the main cutter, between the main cutter teeth, and have a smaller tooth height than the main cutter teeth. Since the trimmer teeth only perform a small portion the cutting work, advantageously fewer trimmer teeth are provided than main cutter teeth so that, for example, one trimmer tooth is provided only after every second or third main cutter tooth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> For the same reason of the trimmer teeth performing less of the cutting work, according to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the trimmer teeth are comprised of a softer and therefore less expensive material than the main cutter teeth and can, for example, be set out from the saw blade. The set trimmer teeth are then ground in the cutting region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the main cutter teeth of the saw blade, which has the trimmer teeth, are embodied as narrower in the axial direction than the main cutter teeth of the other saw blade. With a suitable dimensioning, the torque required for sawing remains approximately equal in the two saw blades and no imbalance is produced by the insetting of the trimmer teeth, thus preserving the virtually reaction force-free sawing with the manually guided circular saw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, at least one coaxial friction ring is disposed between the saw blades and its axial thickness is slightly greater than the distance that the trimmer teeth project from the saw blade plane. This friction ring absorbs the friction of the counter-rotating saw blades when the saw blades are pressed together in the work piece so that the trimmer teeth are relieved of the friction against the opposite saw blade and less heat is produced in the kerf. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to alternative embodiments of the invention, the at least one friction ring can travel freely between the saw blades; it is preferably guided against the lower edge of the trimmer teeth or against the drive spindle of the saw blade, or the friction ring is fastened to one of the saw blades, e.g. by means of spot welding, rivets, glue, etc. In addition, the surface of the at least one friction ring is advantageously optimized in terms of its sliding properties through materials selection or by means of a suitable coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the trimmer teeth of the trimmer are disposed on a separate annular or disk-shaped support, which is non-rotatably attached to one of the saw blades. This has the advantage that the trimmer can be produced without having to make changes to the saw blades. Grooves and projections on the saw blades are eliminated, which minimizes grinding costs and wobble. In addition, a complex soldering-on and grinding of hard metal cutting edges on different saw blade radii (main cutter teeth on the outside, trimmer teeth further inside). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, a friction-reducing coating is provided on the free support side of the support or on the blade side of the other saw blade oriented toward this support side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the trimmer teeth are made of the material of the support, for which e.g. super-speed steel or tool steel is then used, or are embodied as separate, soldered-on teeth made of another material, e.g. hard metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the saw blade, which has the support with the trimmer teeth fastened to it, is provided with means, e.g. channels, by means of which the material cuttings produced by the trimmer teeth can be carried away.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The sawing tools for a hand circular power saw, which are shown in various views and sections in the drawings, each have two coaxial circular saw blades, which can be driven to counter-rotate in relation to each other, referred to below as saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which after being clamped into the tool holding fixture of a hand circular power saw, not shown here, are each non-rotatably connected to one of two concentrically disposed counter-rotating drive spindles. Each saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has an external set of teeth <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, referred to below as the main cutter, comprised of the large number of main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Each main cutter tooth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a main cutting edge <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, an outer secondary cutting edge <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, and an inner secondary cutting edge <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>; the inner secondary cutting edges <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> of the two saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are oriented toward each other (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows only a detail of the sets of teeth <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the two saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; otherwise, each set of teeth <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is symbolized by its reference circle <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Between the two saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, there is a so-called trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is non-rotatably attached to one of the saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and shares an axial overlap with the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a large number of cutting edges, which are radially recessed in relation to the main cutting edges <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and have an axial width that is greater than the reciprocal axial distance between the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the two saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to cut away a piece of material <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), which possibly remains between the saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during sawing and can result when there is a large axial gap between the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> due to wear of the main cutting edges <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and due to axial tolerances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the cutting edges of the trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are constituted by the inner secondary cutting edges <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> of the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which are oriented toward the saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and are inclined in relation to the saw blade plane so that their outer edge <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>adjoining the main cutting edge <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is recessed from the saw blade plane and their inner edge <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at the other end projects from the saw blade plane. The inner secondary cutting edges <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> of the other saw blade <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> oriented toward the trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are inclined parallel to them. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a detail of a longitudinal section through a new sawing tool. The inner secondary cutting edges <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> of the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> rotate past each other with almost no gap between them. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an enlargement of the detail III in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of the sawing tool, which has already experienced a degree of wear. As a result of the wear, a piece of material <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> remains in the kerf cut into the work piece <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> during the sawing process; this piece of material <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is then cut away by the inner secondary cutting edges <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> of the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in their function as a trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Under some circumstances, lateral forces produced in the trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are absorbed by an inclination of the outer secondary cutting edges <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> supporting the trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The inclination angle here is chosen so that the cutting corner formed with the main cutting edge <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is recessed slightly from the saw blade plane. The inclination angle of the outer cutting edges <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is labeled &agr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment of the sawing tool according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a large number of trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which each have a cutting edge <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and are arranged in succession in a circle concentric to the coinciding saw blade axes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are embodied on the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that they project laterally from the saw blade plane and protrude into an annular groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which is concentric to the saw blade axis <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and is embodied in the saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> directly under its teeth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As a result, the axial width of the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and therefore of its cutting edges <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, is greater than the maximal possible distance between the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the sawing tool during the sawing process. In addition, when an axial pressure on the sawing tool occurs during the sawing process, the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is supported by means of the side surfaces <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the groove base of the annular groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that the sharp cutting corners of the two saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are reliably prevented from colliding during operation, which would severely damage them. In order to reduce friction, at least the groove bottom of the annular groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided with a friction-reducing coating. As the perspective view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows, the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are disposed between cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and have a lower tooth height than the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment of the trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the teeth <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the two saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, functioning as main cutters, perform virtually all of the sawing work, which is split in half between the two of them, and by contrast the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, with their recessed cutting edges <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, cut only a piece of material possibly remaining between the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Since the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> perform significantly less cutting work, fewer trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> than main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be provided. Instead of one trimmer tooth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being disposed between every other main cutter tooth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, one trimmer tooth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be provided only after every second or third main cutter tooth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. For the same reason, the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also be made of softer and therefore less expensive material than the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Therefore the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in the exemplary embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, can be worked from the saw blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by means of setting and can be ground in the cutting region and on the side surface <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that protrudes into the annular groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment of the sawing tool depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the thickness of the saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the region of the saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> underneath the circumferential set of teeth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is reduced as a whole, which produces a recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> enclosed by the ring of teeth. The trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which are disposed on the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and project from its blade plane, protrude into this recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In contrast to the sawing tool according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, an axial force acting on the sawing tool during sawing is achieved not by the support of the side surfaces <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> against the saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but by means of two friction rings <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which are disposed between the two saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and have an axial thickness that is slightly greater than the distance that the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> project from the blade plane of the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The two friction rings <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are loosely supported between the saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; the outer friction ring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is guided against the bottom edge of the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner friction ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is supported on one of the drive spindles (not shown here) that support the saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, the two friction rings <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can also be fastened to the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or the saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, e.g. by means of spot welding, rivets, glue, etc. In order to minimize friction, the surfaces of the two friction rings <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are the optimized in terms of their sliding properties through materials selection or by means of a suitable coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> supporting the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are embodied so that they are narrower in the axial direction than the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the saw blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As a result, with suitable dimensioning of the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the torque required for sawing remains approximately equal in the two saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and no imbalance is produced by the insetting of the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This preserves the advantageous, virtually reaction force-free sawing with the end circular power saw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In exemplary embodiment of the sawing tool according to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the trimmer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is embodied as a separate component and is non-rotatably attached to the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are disposed equidistantly along the circumference of a support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which is annular in this exemplary embodiment, but can also be alternatively embodied as a disk. The support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is attached to the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that the cutting edges <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are disposed approximately at the same height as the bottom of the teeth of the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Each tooth bottom is recessed by a radially extending channel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which extends past the radial width of the annular support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The large number of channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> serves to carry away the cuttings produced by the trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during the sawing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a detail of the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the annular support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> fastened to it, with its circumferentially arranged trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a detail of the other saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which has the main cutter teeth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and which&mdash;as the sectional depiction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> indicates&mdash;is disposed coaxial to the saw blade <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>; the annular support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is disposed between the two saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The axial distance between the two saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is depicted in a very exaggerated form for the sake of clarity in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>. The actual distance is smaller. When an axial force that presses the saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> together occurs during the sawing process, the annular support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is supported axially against the blade plane of the saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In order to reduce the friction that is generated as a result, the support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> or the saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided with a friction-reducing coating on the sides oriented toward each other. The axial thickness of the support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is chosen so that when the support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> rests against the saw blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the inner cutting edges <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> on the saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that are oriented toward each other can rotate past each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are preferably worked from the material of the support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which is comprised, for example, of super-speed steel or tool steel. The trimmer teeth <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, however, can also be soldered onto the support as separate teeth made of a different material, e.g. hard metal. The advantage of the latter sawing tool over the sawing tools described previously in conjunction with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is that the support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be manufactured with a constant axial thickness and no grooves or steps are required in the saw blades <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. On the one hand, this minimizes the so-called wobble of the sawing tool and on the other hand, it reduces the costs for manufacturing it, particularly those incurred by grinding work. </paragraph>
