<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on a power tool with two cutting wheels, in particular a circular saw blades, which rotate past each other in opposite directions and rest directly against each other, of the generic type defined in the preamble to claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a known power tool of this type (DE 298 04 220 U1), the form-fitting rotary slaving of the cutting wheels by the support flange of the power tool is assured by means of a bayonet system, which for each cutting wheel, has three keyhole-like securing openings spaced apart at regular angular intervals in the surface of the wheel and for each support flange, has three securing elements, which protrude from the support flange spaced at regular circumference angle intervals and have a securing section shaped like a countersunk head. The clamping means have compression springs on the securing elements, which springs are supported between the support flange and the securing elements that move axially in relation to the support flange. Each cutting wheel is placed against the respective support flange in such a way that the larger diameter part of the three securing openings slides over the countersunk head-like securing sections of the securing elements and is then rotated in relation to the support flange in the working rotation direction of the cutting wheel, causing the narrower part of the securing openings to slide underneath the countersunk head-like securing sections and the cutting wheel to be pressed against the securing section by the compression spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A bayonet system of this kind does in fact permit a tool-free mounting of the cutting wheels, but is sensitive to contamination, e.g. by metal cuttings generated in the sawing process. In addition, this tool fitting requires a large amount of space in the axial direction, which can only be made possible by reducing the distances between bearings on the drive spindles. But this means that a lower stability and a higher bearing load must be taken into account. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The power tool according to the invention has the advantage of a simple design of the tool fitting with a high operational reliability and a low space requirement in which the cutting wheels can be changed without tools. After the one cutting wheel is placed against the first support flange connected to the outer drive spindle, the second cutting wheel is placed against the first cutting wheel and then the other support flange is placed against it, which centers the second cutting wheel and produces the form fit for its rotary slaving. Then, the screw part is manually screwed hand-tight into the inner drive spindle, the second support flange being supported axially against the inner drive spindle. Now the clamping part is manually activated, which exerts an increased axial contact force against the second support flange and thereby clamps the screw part in the thread of the inner drive spindle, which assures a vibration-proof, operationally reliable screw connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Advantageous modifications and improvements of the power tool disclosed in claim 1 are possible by means of the steps taken in the remaining claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, a threaded bolt loosely supporting a clamping plate is used as the screw part and the clamping part is a clamping lever, which is affixed to the end of the screw part by means of a pivot pin and has an eccentric cam that is formed onto it and is preferably of one piece with it. The eccentric cam is formed so that when the clamping lever is pivoted out of a position that lies in the plane of the threaded bolt axis, it comes into contact with the clamping plate supported against the second support flange. This structural design has the advantage that the clamping lever is used for two functions. In its position protruding at right angles from the support flange, it serves as a handle for screwing in the threaded bolt, and in its contact position pivoted against the support flange, it exerts a clamping force that is strong enough to reliably prevent the tool fitting from releasing during operation of the power tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, a disc spring is disposed between the clamping plate and the second support flange and compensates for axial tolerances during clamping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the clamping lever has a semicircular contour whose diameter is smaller than the outer diameter of the second support flange. On the one hand, this assures that the clamping lever pivoted against the outside of the support flange remains inside the contour of the flange and on the other hand, when in an upright position, in which it extends along the axis of the threaded bolt, can be easily grasped like a thumb screw and the threaded bolt can therefore be tightened in an ergonomically favorable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the second support flange, on its outer surface oriented toward the clamping lever, has a concentric protective collar, which protrudes beyond the clamping lever resting against the outer surface and whose diameter is greater than the diameter of the semicircular contour of the clamping lever. This protective collar is recessed in at least two diametrically opposed positions, so as to permit the clamping lever, which is folded over against the outer surface, to be easily grasped. Preferably, the protective collar is comprised of individual humps, which are spaced apart from one another so that enough space remains between the humps to permit access to the clamping lever. When the power tool is set down, this protective collar, which protrudes slightly beyond the folded-over clamping lever, protects the folded clamping lever, which is rotating along with the inner drive spindle that is still coasting to a stop, from striking the support surface or being otherwise damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the clamping plate is embodied as an asymmetrical deep-drawn part with a raised semicircular area, which covers the flange surface not occupied by the clamping lever pivoted against the outer surface of the support flange, flush with this pivoted clamping lever. In addition to protecting the clamping lever when the power tool is set down on a support surface while its cutting wheels are still rotating, such a design also protects the clamping lever from objects striking the rotating tool fitting from an axial direction; these objects instead strike against the semicircular surface and therefore cannot catch on the rotating clamping lever. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the eccentric cam has two flat clamping surfaces offset from each other by a circumference angle of approximately 90&deg;, which are embodied so that the eccentric cam permits the clamping plate to be engaged by the clamping lever in a stable detent fashion in its position aligned along the axis of the threaded bolt and in its pivoted position resting against the outer surface of the support flange so that these two operating positions of the clamping lever are exactly defined and can only be &lsqb;overridden&rsqb; through the exertion of force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, a radial bearing is fastened between the inner drive spindle and the inner cup wall of a bearing cup, which is affixed to the outer drive spindle and supports the first support flange, and the inner drive spindle rests with a contact shoulder against this radial bearing. This fixes the reciprocal axial spacing of the two drive spindles and the two support flanges and defines the axial gap between the two cutting wheels rotating in opposite directions.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The power tool, which has two cutting wheels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rotating past each other in opposite directions and resting against each other and is shown in a detailed longitudinal sectional view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, has a machine housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is subdivided into a motor housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a transmission housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that is flange-mounted to the motor housing. The motor housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> contains an electric motor, which drives the cutting wheels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and whose driven shaft extends in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the housing, and the transmission housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> contains an angular gear mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which transmits the rotational movement of the driven shaft to the cutting wheels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, whose wheel axes are aligned at right angles to the axis of the driven shaft, in such a way that the two cutting wheels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rotate in opposite directions. In the exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the power tool is embodied as a hand saw and the cutting wheels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are comprised of two circular saw blades. In order to use the power tool as a disc grinder, grinding wheels of the kind commonly used in right angle grinders are used as the cutting wheels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Each cutting wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is non-rotatably connected by means of a tool fitting <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to one of two concentrically disposed drive spindles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The hollow outer drive spindle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is supported inside the transmission housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in two radial bearings that are spaced apart from each other, of which only the lower radial bearing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, while the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is supported against the outer drive spindle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by means of radial bearings. The ends of the two drive spindles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> protrude out from the transmission housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The tool fitting <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for the cutting wheels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is mounted on the protruding ends <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The tool fitting <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a bearing cup <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which is non-rotatably supported, e.g. by means of a press fit, on the protruding end <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> of the outer drive spindle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and which is provided with a first support flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and, on its end, is provided with a centering collar <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for receiving the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and is provided with a gearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The centering collar <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and gearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are clearly shown in the enlarged depiction of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. When a cutting wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is placed against the support flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the gearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> engages in a circumferential gearing <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) embodied in the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, concentric to the wheel axis, so that as it rotates, the bearing cup <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> driven by the drive spindle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> carries the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> along with it in a form-fitting, slaving manner. A radial bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which rests against the cup bottom, is fastened between the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the inner cup wall of the bearing cup <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> rests against this radial bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by means of an annular contact shoulder <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The radial bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is fastened in the bearing cup <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by means of a press fit or&mdash;as shown clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>&mdash;by means of a securing ring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which rests in an annular groove <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the inner cup wall and overlaps the radial bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The radial bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> simultaneously produces a direct axial fixing of the two drive spindles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in relation to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The tool fitting <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> also has a second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which can be clamped in relation to the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by clamping means; at the same time, the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> holds the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in form-fitting engagement with the first support flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. On its inner surface oriented toward the first support flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a gearing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which cooperates with a gearing <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) embodied on the wheel surface of the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, concentric to the wheel axis, to produce the form-fitting rotary slaving of the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by means of the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and, with its outer contour, centers the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In addition, between the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the protruding end <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a profiled gearing <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is provided, which assures a rotary slaving of the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by means of the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is supported at the bottom of the profiled gearing <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, axially against a radial shoulder <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> embodied on the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The clamping means have a threaded bolt <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> pivotably affixed to the bolt head, a clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> disposed concentric to the threaded bolt <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and a disc spring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed between the clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the outer surface of the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> oriented away from the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The threaded bolt <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be screwed with its threaded section into an internal threaded bore <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which bore is cut into the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the end. The threaded bolt <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is inserted through a central opening <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which opening is disposed coaxially inside a recess <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the outer flange surface of the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> oriented away from the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When the threaded bolt <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is inserted through the central opening <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the recess <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> accommodates the disc spring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, with the disc spring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> resting against the bottom of the recess <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is pivotably supported on the threaded bolt <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> by means of a pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which passes through the bolt head of the threaded bolt <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a semicircular contour (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), whose diameter is smaller than the outer diameter of the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This semicircular form assures that when pivoted against the outer flange surface, the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> lies inside the contour of the clamping flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As shown particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an eccentric cam <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is embodied on the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and is preferably of one piece with the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The eccentric cam <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> disposed close to the pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shaped so that when the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> pivoted out of a position pointing in the direction of the threaded bolt axis <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, the cam comes into contact with the clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and exerts a contact force against it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In order to insert the cutting wheels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the tool fitting <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, first the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is placed against the first support flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, where it is centered by the centering collar <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Then the second cutting wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed against the first cutting wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is placed against it. With the outer contour of its profiled gearing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> centers the second cutting wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and with the profiled gearing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, engages in detent fashion with the gearing <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the cutting wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and with the part of the profiled gearing <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> embodied on it, is slid onto the part of the profiled gearing <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> embodied on the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Now the threaded bolt <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> supporting the clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the disc spring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted through the central opening <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and is manually screwed into the internal thread <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>; in its position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> serves as a handle. The threaded bolt <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is screwed hand-tight into the internal thread <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which presses the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the bottom of the profiled gearing <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> axially against the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Since the hand-tight screwing-in is not sufficient to assure a vibration-proof, operationally reliable screw connection, the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is then folded flat against the outer surface of the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, its eccentric cam <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, by means of the clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the disc spring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, clamping the second support flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in relation to the threaded bolt <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and thereby clamping it in relation to the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the eccentric cam <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has two flat clamping surfaces <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> offset from each other by approximately 90&deg;, which are embodied so that by means of each of these clamping surfaces <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> respectively engages the clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in detent fashion in its pivot positions depicted with solid lines in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the detent moment being strong enough that the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can only be pivoted out of the detent position through a definite exertion of force. As a result, the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is reliably secured in the respective pivot position and cannot independently pivot away from the support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> even during operation of the power tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the event that the power tool is set down on a support surface while the cutting wheels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are still coasting to a stop, in order to protect the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that is still rotating along with the inner drive spindle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a concentric protective collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided on the outer flange surface of the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and its diameter is selected to be greater than the diameter of the semicircular clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> pivoted against the outer flange surface. This protective collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is recessed in at least two diametrically opposed positions, so as to permit the folded-over clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to be easily grasped by reaching through the protective collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment of the power tool described, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this protective collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is comprised of a number of humps <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, four in this instance, which are spaced uniformly apart from one another. The protective collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or the humps <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, protrude slightly beyond the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is pivoted against the outer flange surface of the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so that when the power tool is set down on a support surface in the vicinity of the tool fitting, this protective collar <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or the humps <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> rest against the support surface; the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is pivoted against the support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, can continue to rotate underneath with no hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a modification of the tool fitting <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; is also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a modification of the tool fitting <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; is also embodied as an asymmetrical deep-drawn part with a raised semicircular area <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Before the tool fitting <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is clamped, the clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; is placed against the outer surface of the second support flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so that the raised semicircular area <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> covers the flange surface not occupied by the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> pivoted against the outer flange surface. This assures that the rotating clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> cannot catch on an object that strikes the rotating clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from an axial direction. This also reduces the risk of injury to a user who inadvertently touches the surface of the clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> while the power tool is running, since the folded-over clamping lever <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> constitutes an approximately flat surface together with the raised semicircular area <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> due to the shaping of the clamping plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
