<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a ball valve that is fitted in a pipe for cold or hot water, air or gas and used therein to start, stop or control the flow of the relevant fluid, and to a method for the production thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, a forged or cast blank or a round bar material is cut to form a main body, and necessary internal parts are incorporated, screwed or bolted in the main body, thereby assembling ball valves of this class. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> These ball valves, however, are expensive because they entail high material costs on account of large numbers of man-hour, high prices of blanks, and large numbers of component parts and require high process costs for the works of cutting and the works of assemblage. They have comparatively great weights as well. Further, since the blanks for processed parts necessitate margins for machining in advance, the costs of materials inevitably increase proportionately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To cope with these problems, the concept of forming a ball valve by resorting to the technique of press working utilizing a pipe has been proposed. (Refer to JP-A SHO 62-165081, JP-A SHO 63-266276 and JP-A HEI 10-122390.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, since the ball valve produced by the press working technique using a pipe has a construction such that it acquires the sealing property thereof by having a ball tightened in a valve seat part, such as a ball seat, which is an elastic member during the assembly of the ball valve, the incorporation of internal components into the pipe necessitates a step of tentative assemblage using the internal components as an integral unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The ball valve, therefore, encounters the problem of adding a step of tentative assemblage and a step of dissolving the tentative assemblage, increasing the total number of steps of operation and boosting the cost of production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Even if the step of tentative assemblage of internal components should be avoided, manufacturing ball valves uniformly with high accuracy as finished products by the technique under discussion has proved extremely difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The screw connection is prevalently adopted generally for connecting a valve of a small diameter to a pipe. When the ball valve utilizing a pipe is joined to a pipe by the screw connection, since the construction of this ball valve requires a screw part different from the valve seat member to be welded to the terminal part of the body made of the pipe or fastened to the terminal part, expanded diametrically in advance, of the body made of the pipe, this screw connection incurs the problem of complicating the process of production of the ball valve and unduly elongating the interface dimensions of the valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention which has been developed in view of the problems mentioned above is aimed at providing a ball valve excelling in economy owing to the efforts devoted to the reduction of cost, enjoying light weight and high reliability, manifesting high and uniform accuracy, and enabling manufacture of compact finished products having a small interface dimension and at providing a method for the production of the ball valve. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To attain the above objects, the present invention provides a ball valve comprising a body formed from a pipe having a predetermined length by subjecting opposite terminal parts of the pipe to a plastic processing including flaring and diametrical contraction, the body having at a central position a seat-producing part formed with a stem-inserting hole, a stem inserted into the stem-inserting hole, a ball disposed non-rotatably at a lower terminal of the stem, and a pair of inserting members of an annular shape forced into the body from opposite terminals of the body, opposite terminal faces of the body being compression-formed so that the pair of inserting members receive and support the ball rotatably. In the ball valve, the plastic processing is angular flaring work so that the body has angular opposite terminal faces, and the paired inserting members have similar angular outer peripheral faces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a method for the production of a ball valve, comprising cutting a pipe in a predetermined length, subjecting opposite terminal parts of the length of the pipe to a plastic processing including flaring and diametrical contraction, thereby forming a body, forming a stem-inserting hole in seat producing parts formed at an approximately central position of the body, then forcing one of a pair of annular inserting members into the body from one side thereof, joining a ball non-rotatably to a lower terminal of a stem inserted into the stem-inserting hole, forcing the other of the pair of inserting members into the body from the other side thereof, and causing the pair of inserting members to receive and support the ball rotatably, with a predetermined allowance for tightening furnished for the ball, while compression-forming opposite terminal faces of the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a ball valve having a construction comprising a predetermined length of a pipe having stem-inserting holes at an approximately central position of the pipe, stems inserted in the stem-inserting holes, a ball joined non-rotatably to lower terminals of the stems, a pair of annular inserting members set on inner peripheries of opposite terminals of the pipe, opposite terminal faces of the pipe being diametrically contracted or compressed to join the pair of inserting members to the pipe and cause the pair of inserting members to receive and support the ball rotatably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a method for the production of a ball valve, comprising cutting a pipe in a predetermined length, forming stem-inserting holes in the pipe at an approximately central position thereof, inserting stems into the stem-inserting holes, setting a ball non-rotatably to lower terminals of the stems, setting a pair of annular inserting members to inner peripheries of opposite terminals of the pipe and causing the pair of inserting members to receive the ball from opposite sides of the pipe and rotatably support the ball, and diametrically contracting or compressing the opposite terminals of the pipe till the inserting members and the pipe are joined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a method for the production of a ball valve, comprising cutting a pipe in a predetermined length, forming stem inserting holes in the pipe at an approximately central position thereof, setting an annular inserting member on an inner periphery of one of opposite terminals of the pipe, diametrically contracting or compressing the one terminal of the pipe, thereby fixing the inserting member, then inserting stems into the stem-inserting holes, joining a ball non-rotatably to lower terminals of the stems, thereafter setting another annular inserting member on an inner periphery of the other terminal of the pipe, thereby causing the pair of inserting members to receive and support the ball rotatably, and further diametrically contracting or compressing the other terminal of the pipe against the another inserting member, thereby joining the another inserting member and the pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provide a ball valve comprising a pipe of a predetermined length having stem-inserting holes formed therein and terminals diametrically contracted to form seal-retaining parts, a pair of seal rings, one of which is set in one of the seal-retaining parts, stems inserted into the stem-inserting holes, a ball joined non-rotatably to a lower terminal of the stems, the ball having one side thereof colliding with the one seal ring, the other of the seal rings being allowed to collide against the other side of the ball, and an insert ring incorporated on a rear terminal side of the other seal ring, and the other seal ring and the insert ring being retained by the other of the seal-retaining parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a method for the production of a ball valve, comprising cutting a pipe in a predetermined length, diametrically contracting terminals of the pipe, thereby forming seal-retaining parts of a tapered shape and stem-inserting holes, setting one of a pair of seal rings on one of the seal-retaining parts, then joining a ball to a stem inserted into one of the stem-inserting holes, thereby allowing one side of the ball to collide against the one seal ring, subsequently setting the other of the pair of seal rings on the other side of the ball, incorporating an insert ring in the other seal ring on the rear terminal side thereof, and then causing the other of the seal-retaining parts to set and retain the other seal ring and the insert ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, therefore, the attempt to allow the product a decreased weight can be fulfilled because the product using an inexpensive pipe as the blank for its main body has a lighter weight than the conventional cast or forged product. Since the product of this invention requires no cutting step as compared with the conventional products which require cutting steps for the sake of their main bodies, lids and various joined parts, it permits a marked decrease in the time for production and adapts itself for mass production as well and, as a result, allows the cost of production to be greatly lowered, and provides a ball valve veritably excelling in economy. Further, the ball valve to be obtained by this invention enjoys inexpensiveness and contributes to exaltation of reliability because it uses a body of one-piece construction and has joined portions and component parts in very small numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The ball valve is enabled to manifest a sealing force and an operating torque stably because it is formed by subjecting a given pipe to the work of expanding the diameter and the work of contracting the diameter. Since insert members are forced in as pressed at the opposite terminals thereof and the pressure welding of a ball seat to a ball is attained by uniform exertion of pressure, the ball valve to be obtained as a finished product enjoys high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further, since various members, such as the insert members and the ball, can be inserted into the body and readied for assemblage without requiring tentative assemblage, the time for assemblage is shortened. Since the insert members are not required to be furnished with portions for securing mutual distances, the ball valve to be obtained contributes to a decrease in the weight of itself and enables the insert members incorporated therein to assume easily various states of contact needed and facilitates adaptation of a product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The ball valve, despite the use of a pipe, does not need to elongate the interface dimension. Thus, the ball valve is obtained in a compact construction composed of only a small number of components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the invention described above, the ball valve is configured by performing a burring work on a stem-inserting hole to form a tubular part and a stopper piece projecting from part of the tubular part, meanwhile forming a notched groove for regulating rotation in a flange part disposed on a stem, allowing the stopper piece to come into working contact with the notched groove to regulate the rotation of a ball, allowing an O-ring fitted in a fitting groove of the stem to contact the inner wall surface of the tubular part, and forming a stepped part on the upper edge part of the tubular part and fitting packing in the stepped part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Since the consequent impartation of the function of a stopper to the interior of the body contributes to attainment of compaction of the product and reduction of the cost of production and results in integrating the body with the stopper function, the ball valve produces an open-shut motion with exalted accuracy and allows the handle of the valve to operate with a simple construction. Thus, the ball valve enjoys high yield of production and veritably excels in mass-producibility. Further, this invention warrants production of a ball valve that adapts to widely various characteristic properties (temperature, pressure, etc.) of a fluid and exhibits an ideal sealing property.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR EMBODYING THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> This invention will be described more specifically below with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 10</cross-reference> are intended to illustrate a method for the production of a ball valve as contemplated by the first aspect of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the diagrams, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a pipe. This pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a thin-wall (non-thick-wall) type seamless pipe of copper alloy or stainless steel. Otherwise, it may be a seamed pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> produced by shaping a steel plate in the form of a roll and then converting the roll into a cylinder by joining the opposed edges of the roll as by means of welding. A body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of ball valve is formed by cutting a predetermined length of this pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, namely the length of a prospective valve box of ball valve, deburring the opposite ends of the length of the pipe severed by cutting, and then subjecting the opposite parts of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the work of flaring. The flaring work in this case consists in plastic processing an angular (hexagonal, for example) forcing retaining part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that assumes a radial plane. Further, the central position of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is constricted or beaten to form a flat seat-shaping part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed in the internal region of the seat-shaping part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> denotes a ball furnished with a through hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a stem fitting face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed at the position for setting a stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. By joining a non-circular projecting part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed at the lower terminal of the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the stem fitting face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be joined in a non-rotary state. A flange part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> formed in the lower part of the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> prevents the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from being flung out by the pressure of a fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> By reference numeral <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is denoted a handle. This handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fixed in a non-rotary state to the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and clamped fast with a nut <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> through a spring washer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a washer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> disposed respectively in the upper and the lower part of the handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> By numerals <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are denoted an example of a pair of annular insert members. These insert members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are symmetrically incorporated bilaterally relative to the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The insert members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> each retain on the inner peripheral side of the leading terminal part thereof a seat ring <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> endowed with a sealing property and they are each enabled, by a sealing member (O ring) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made of resin and set on the outer periphery of insert member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, to manifest the function of a gasket with the inner peripheral face of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The insert members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are each formed either by rolling a thick-wall pipe or a thick-wall plate, then joining the opposed edges of the roll as by means of welding, thereby giving rise to a metallic tube, and cutting the tube by means of rolling or press working or by drawing a thick-wall plate material into the shape shown in the diagram by the press working. Otherwise, they may be formed by precision casting, such as the lost-wax process, or by sintering a metallic powder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Further, the insert members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> contemplated by this invention possess such a thickness as to manifest fully satisfactory strength during the course of joining and also possess fully satisfactory strength to withstand the force exerted during the forced insertion into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, the ball valve of this invention is directed toward allocating functions, decreasing weight and compacting construction by adopting a configuration which derives the strength necessary for a pressure vessel mainly from the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed of a thin-wall pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the strength to withstand the impact of joining pipes or of effecting the forced insertion into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the strength necessary for maintaining the bearing stress between the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the seat ring <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> mainly from the insert member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which is a thick-wall part. The insert members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are each furnished at the terminal part thereof on the opposite side relative to the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a tapered part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> disposed at a suitable angle along the respective angularly shaped outer peripheral faces <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. These inert members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be endowed with a suitable form of union, such as a female thread <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is used in the present case. Thus, the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may have suitably incorporated therein a portion for union, such as a female thread, without requiring an alteration in the length of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is formed of a predetermined length of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is intended to illustrate an example of providing the body in the interior thereof with a stopper mechanism for a handle. With reference to this diagram, the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is given a burring work to form a tubular part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of a small length and a stopper piece <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> integrally projected from part of this tubular part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, a notched groove <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for regulating rotation is formed in the flange part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> provided for the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is so disposed as to have the rotation thereof regulated to an angle of about 90 degrees by means of a stopper mechanism formed by meshing the stopper piece <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the notched groove <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Then, by allowing an O-ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> inserted in a fitting groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to contact the inner peripheral face of the tubular part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the ball valve can be infallibly sealed with a compact structure. Further, by forming a stepped part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the upper edge part of the tubular part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and fitting a washer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a gland <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and gland packing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the stepped part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is enabled to retain the sealing property and exalt the performance of torque. In this case, the operating torque of the handle may be relied on to disperse the force exerted on the stopper mechanism and prevent the stopper mechanism from being deformed by providing the flange part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with two notched grooves <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> indicated with a chain line and meshing these notched grooves <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the two stopper pieces <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Now, one example of the method for producing the ball valve in this invention will be described specifically below with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> furnished with the forcing retaining part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of an approximately hexagonal shape is formed by cutting the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a predetermined length and subjecting the opposite parts of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to plastic processing resorting to the work of flaring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The process of seat shaping and perforation is carried out by drawing the approximately central position of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby forming the seat-shaping part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and perforating the seat-shaping part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, thereby forming the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, a barring work is performed on the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In consequence of this burring work, the tubular part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the stopper piece <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> produced by projecting part of the tubular part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Then, one of the pair of annular inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> similar in figure to the forcing retaining part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is forced into the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through one side thereof and thereafter the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is non-rotatably joined to the lower terminal of the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> inserted in the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as illustrated in the same diagram. In this case, the notched groove <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for regulating rotation to an approximate angle of 90 degrees is formed in the flange part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> provided for the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the stopper piece <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is meshed with the notched groove <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and incorporated in such a manner in the body as to regulate the rotation of the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further, the other inserting member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is forced in through the forcing retaining part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the other side of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the ball valve is produced by causing the seat rings <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the pair of inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to support the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rotatably with a predetermined tightening margin allowed for the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and, in the meanwhile, simultaneously beating the terminal face parts (diametrically contracted parts) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on both sides of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with jigs <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, thereby compression-forming the terminal face parts along the contour of the tapered part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the inserting member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is supported on the seat rings <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and enabled meanwhile to retain the sealing property and the property of torque as predetermined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The ball valve using the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of such a straight type as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is produced through the process described above. In the process involving a flaring step as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed in the shape illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> by first flaring circularly the opposite side parts of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and then flaring them in a hexagonal shape. The rest of this process is identical with the preceding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the ball valve of this invention, since the construction of the ball valve varies with the bore size (ball port diameter), it is proper to apply the construction illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to the ball valve of a full port type and the construction illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> to the ball valve of a reduced port type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 through 19</cross-reference> depict the method for producing a ball valve contemplated in the second aspect of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Like parts used in the ball valve and the method for production thereof in the present aspect of this invention and in the preceding aspect of the invention will be denoted by like reference numerals and will be omitted from the following description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, denoted by <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a seal retaining part formed in a tapered shape in the pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at an approximately central position thereof by such plastic processing as swaging or press working. The seat-producing parts <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed in a planar shape as by drawing one each on the outside and inside of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a position approximating closely to the seal-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed as well in the area inside the seat-producing part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Now, the ball valve and the method for production thereof contemplated by the second aspect of this invention will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> First, the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is cut to obtain a length thereof needed to form the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of ball valve as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Then, the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is diametrically contracted in the neighborhood of the central part thereof as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> to form the seal-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a tapered shape. The seat-producing parts <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of a planar shape are formed in the central part of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the positions approximating closely to the seal-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in a circular shape is formed by punching in the area inside the seat-producing part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Then, the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is inserted into the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from the inner side of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inserted into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from either of the sides thereof, with the stem-inserting face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> held in the direction parallel to the flow path so as to retain the projecting part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as joined in a non-rotary state to the stem-inserting face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The seat rings <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the sealing members (O-rings) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are respectively fitted in the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are inserted into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the opposite terminals thereof till the seat rings <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which are the leading terminal parts of the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> receive and support the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rotatably from the opposite sides and the sealing members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are incorporated in such a state as to contact the seat-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>closely and complete a seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the seal-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed in a tapered shape by diametrically contracting or compressing the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by swaging or press working so as to align substantially the through hole <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the seat ring <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> with the through hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are joined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Since the seal-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed closely along the contour of the tapered parts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, they exert a wedging effect on the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and move the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> slightly toward the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with the result that the pair of seat rings <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are accurately positioned because their mutual distance is adjusted to the predetermined magnitude. When the sealing members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are made to depress the seal-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are aligned more accurately because the wedging effect of the tapered shape of the seal-retaining members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>exerts a force in the axial direction on the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> It would be advantageous to perform the work of diametrical contraction or compression on the entire periphery of the seal-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>along the contour of the tapered parts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> thereof. So long as the retaining part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is disposed at least at one place along the contour of the tapered parts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the sealing property between the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be retained because the sealing members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are moved toward the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and brought into contact with the seal-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The process described above is preferably automated with proper means, such as jigs. Further, the tapered parts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, while the valve is in use, fulfills the function of preventing the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from being extracted out of the valve by the inner pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The diametrical contraction can be effected by performing the work of drawing up to a plurality of repetitions till the diameter is contracted to the predetermined magnitude. Since the division of the work into the plurality of parts manifests a function of exalting the strength of the part subjected to the diametrical contraction, it is effective in increasing the strength of the ball valve and enabling the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be positioned more accurately. The quantity of the diametrical contraction and the number of forming works involved in this case may be properly decided liberally to suit the relevant operation to be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a cross section illustrating another example of the method for production of the ball valve contemplated by the second aspect of the invention. Like parts used in the present aspect of this invention and in the preceding aspect of the invention will be denoted by like reference numerals and will be omitted from the following description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the present example, the production is effected by a procedure which comprises preparing the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by cutting in a predetermined length, forming the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the approximately central position of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, fitting the inserting member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of an annular shape in the inner periphery on one side of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, diametrically contracting or compressing the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> till the inserting member is fixed to the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then inserting the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and joining the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a non-rotary state to the lower terminal of the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The procedure further comprises fitting the inserting member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of an annular shape to the inner periphery on the other side of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, causing the pair of inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to receive and support rotatably the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and further diametrically contracting or compressing the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> toward the inserting member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> inserted into the interior of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the other side till the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are joined. During the course of the diametrical contraction or compression, the diametrically contracted parts <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> formed by diametrically contracting the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are meshed with depressed parts <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>disposed at proper positions along the outer periphery of the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to fix the inserting members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> lest they should rotate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A thrust washer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is interposed between the flange part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the seat-producing part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> both formed in the lower part of the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The diameter of this thrust washer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is set at the magnitude D that has an allowance in advance for the elliptic strain due to the diametrical contraction of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (d&plus;&Dgr;d) (D&gt;d&plus;&Dgr;d) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. This diameter is large enough to avoid hindering the smooth motion of the stem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22, a</cross-reference> jig <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is made to support the side of the seal-retaining part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed at one of the terminal parts of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a jig <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is made to support the seal ring <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and forming jigs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are disposed on the other terminal part side of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> denotes the handle. This handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is attached in a non-rotary state to the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and is provided with a stopper adapted to stop at angular intervals of about 90 degrees and is fixed by tightening with the nut <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> through the spring washer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a washer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which are disposed respectively on and beneath the handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As another example, the provision of a stopper mechanism similarly to the preceding aspects of the invention is conceivable. To be specific, the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is subjected to a burring work to form the tubular part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of a short length and a stopper piece <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> projected integrally from part of the tubular part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. Meanwhile, the notched groove <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for regulating rotation is formed in the flange part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and, owing to the stopper mechanism obtained by meshing the stopper piece <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the notched groove <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is so disposed as to have the rotation thereof regulated at an angle of about 90 degrees. Further, by setting the washer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a gland <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and gland packing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the upper edge part of the tubular part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is enabled to retain the sealing property and enjoy an improvement in the property of torque. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Now, one example of the method for production of the ball valve contemplated by the third aspect of this invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> For a start, the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is cut in a length for forming the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ball valve as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Then, the seal-retaining part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed in a tapered shape by diametrically contracting one of the terminal parts of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the seat-producing part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of a planar shape is formed in the central part of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a position approximating closely to the seal-retaining part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed in a circular shape by performing a punching work in the area inside the seat-producing parts <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the seal rings <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are inserted into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and set at the positions of the seal retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In this case, the seal rings <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> manifest the function of a gasket to the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by having the outer periphery sides <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>thereof tightly seal the inner peripheral surfaces of the seal-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> When the stems are inserted into the stem-inserting holes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the inside of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the thrust washers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>retained on the flange parts <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the stems <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inserted in the direction of making the stem-fitting surfaces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thereof parallel with the flow path into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the side thereof not yet diametrically contracted till the projecting parts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the stems <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are connected in a non-rotary state to the stem-fitting surfaces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, then the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will collide against the seal rings <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in a slightly resilient state. In this case, the seal rings <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> simultaneously fulfill the functions of a seat ring and a gasket and contribute to the reduction of the number of component parts of the ball valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Then, the remainder of the pair of seal rings <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is inserted into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the side thereof not yet diametrically contracted and, at the same time, the insert rings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is inserted into the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> till the tapered parts <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the insert rings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are meshed with the fitting parts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the seal rings <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The various steps of the process described above are preferably properly automated to suit the particular construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the forming jibs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are set on the other terminal part side of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, with the jig <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>supporting the seal-retaining part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in one of the opposite terminal parts of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the jog <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>supporting the seal ring <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. The forming jig <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>fulfills the function of supporting the rear terminal of the insert ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, inserting the jig leading terminal parts into through hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the insert ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, through holes <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the seal ring <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and through holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to align and support the relevant members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Then, with the forming jig <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>kept pressed in the direction of an arrow, the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to the plastic processing, such as swaging or press working, to be diametrically contracted and, at the same time, the seal-retaining part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of a tapered shape is formed. In this case, by pressing the forming jig <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>across a distance L, it is made possible to move the insert ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the seal ring <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> slightly toward the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> owing to the wedging effect generated during the formation of the seal-retaining parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of a tapered shape and adjust the mutual distance of the pair of seal rings <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to a predetermined magnitude and position the seal rings accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The diametrical contraction involved at varying steps mentioned above may be effected by performing the work of drawing up to a plurality of repetitions till the diameter is contracted to the predetermined magnitude. Since the division of the work into the plurality of parts manifests a function of exalting the strength of the part subjected to the diametrical contraction, it is effective in increasing the strength of the ball valve and enabling the parts of the seal rings <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the insert rings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to be positioned more accurately. The quantity of the diametrical contraction and the number of forming works involved in this case may be properly decided liberally to suit the relevant operation to be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> depicts another example of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. It represents the case of burring the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrated in the first and the second aspect of this invention to form a stopper mechanism for the stem (handle) inside the body. The other component parts of the present construction are similar to those of the preceding example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> One example of the ball valve contemplated by yet another aspect of this invention will be described below. The present example can be applied to other aspects than the first through third aspects of the invention. Like parts will be denoted by like reference numerals and omitted from the following description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a pipe. This pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a pipe of a thin-wall type made of copper alloy or stainless steel. Alternatively, the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be produced by shaping a steel plate in the form of a roll and then joining the opposed ends of the roll by such means as welding, thereby imparting a cylindrical form thereto. This pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is cut in a predetermined length, namely the length for forming a valve box of a prospective ball valve, the opposite terminals of the length of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>are burred, and subsequently plastic processing is performed on the opposite terminal parts of the pipe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ball valve. A retaining vessel <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> furnished with an angular through hole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for non-rotatably passing the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a retaining ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are formed of a thin plate material by plastic processing, casting, hot forging or injecting molding. Then, the flange part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to be inserted into the stem-inserting hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is placed in the retaining receptacle <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, a thrust washer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is built in the retaining vessel <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> on the upper side of the flange part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and this thrust washer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is interposed between the rear side of the seat-producing part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the flange part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as illustrated in the diagram. Meanwhile, the gland packing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> inserted into the retaining ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is positioned on the upper side of the seat-producing part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and set in the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the nut <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is helically fitted to the stem <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and then fixed by tightening through the gland <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the washer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The construction thus obtained brings such advantages as preventing the thrust washer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the gland packing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from being deformed or fractured while in service, exalting the sealing effects thereof and enabling them to withstand protracted use without being affected by the characteristic properties (temperature and pressure) of a fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> depicts another example of the handle that can be applied to the various aspects of this invention even when the body is not provided therein with a stopper mechanism for the handle. This handle is produced by deriving an intermediate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for a handle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> from a plate material <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by punching and forming a stopper projecting piece <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the intermediate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by plastic processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> This handle enjoys a great practical value because it yields no waste material, manifests an effect of allowing mass production and contributes to the reduction of cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The ball valve and the method for production thereof contemplated by this invention as described above are suitable for such a ball valve as is set in a piping for cold or hot water, air or gas and operated to open or shut or control the flow of the fluid. Since the ball valve of this invention weighs less than the conventional counterparts made by casting, it realizes the reduction in weight of the product and permits a great cut in the time spent for the production and allows quantity production of ball valves. As a result, the method of production of this invention permits a great decrease in the cost of production and allows provision of ball valves highly excelling in economy. Though this invention is directed toward the ball valve and the method for production thereof, it may be suitably applied to the formation of bodies for valves, such as butterfly valves. </paragraph>
