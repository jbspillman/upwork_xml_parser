<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an air diffuser and a method of flushing an air diffuser and, in particular, to techniques of aerating an intra-tank mixed liquor in membrane separation activated sludge process. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Membrane separators used in membrane separation activated sludge process for biologically treating waste water, drainage water etc have a plurality of membrane cartridges. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> membrane cartridge <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> has filtration membranes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> disposed on the front and rear surfaces of a filter supporting plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> made of resin, and the entire peripheral portions of the filtration membranes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are fused to the filter supporting plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by heating with a heater or by ultrasonic vibration. A transmitted liquor passage is present between the filter supporting plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and each filtration membrane <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. A collecting hole <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> communicated to the transmitted liquor passage extends from front to rear of the filter supporting plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A transmitted liquor outlet <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> communicated to the collecting hole <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed at an upper end of the filter supporting plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the membrane separator, the plural membrane cartridges <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are oriented vertically and in parallel with one another to form a passage between the adjacent membrane cartridges <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Each membrane cartridge <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is connected to a passage for discharging the transmitted liquor via a tube connected to the transmitted liquor outlet <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. In the membrane separator, the filtration membranes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> perform filtration by using a differential pressure between membranes that is exerted between the front and rear of each filtration membrane <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The membrane separator can be operated by forced suction system of applying driving pressure as the suction pressure exerted by a suction pump, or gravity filtration system of applying driving pressure as the water head in the tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The membrane separator has an air diffuser disposed under the membrane cartridges <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. For example, the air diffuser is obtained only by boring a plurality of holes of approximately &phgr;10 mm in a lower part of a pipe made of vinyl chloride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In membrane separation activated sludge process, the membrane separator is immersed in an aeration tank, and an intra-tank mixed liquor containing the activated sludge in the aeration tank is aerated by the air diffused from the air diffuser. The diffused air generates an upstream of gas-liquid-solid mixed phase by air lift action. The upstream supplies the intra-tank mixed liquor to the filtration membranes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the membrane cartridges <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the membrane separator, and the filtration membranes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> performs crossflow filtration of the intra-tank mixed liquor. The crossflow of the upstream of the intra-tank nixed liquor on the membrane surfaces enables to suppress cake from attaching to the membrane surfaces of the filtration membranes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and flush the membrane surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Flushing of the membrane surfaces in the membrane separator requires air supply of averaging not less than 10 L/min for every membrane cartridge <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Unless the air is supplied uniformly to the entire membrane surfaces of the membrane cartridges <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the local area of the filtration membranes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> receiving much air is subjected to a large load, which lowers the lifetime of the membranes. On the other hand, the local area of the filtration membranes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> receiving less air fails to obtain a sufficient flushing effect, which accelerates the attachment of cake to the membrane surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Supplying a predetermined amount of air from the air diffuser ensures oxygen necessary for biological treatment in membrane separation activated sludge process. The predetermined amount of air is set based on the efficiency of oxygen dissolution into activated sludge. Increasing the efficiency of oxygen dissolution is desirable for achieving power saving that is realized by downsizing a blower supplying air to the air diffuser and reducing its driving time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it can be considered that a uniform dispersion of the diffused air and improvement in the efficiency of oxygen dissolution are achieved by arranging blowholes having a small diameter at a plurality of locations of the air diffuser. With this air diffuser, it is however difficult to completely avoid that the blowholes and a diffuser tube become clogged by activated sludge. When the air diffuser becomes clogged, it is difficult to perform biological treatment with activated sludge. It follows that the filtration membranes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the membrane cartridges <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in the membrane separator become clogged by the cake attached to the membrane surfaces. This impairs the function of the membrane separator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore necessary to flush the air diffuser in a periodic maintenance as measure to prevent clogging of the air diffuser. This flushing is usually performed about one time for two weeks. Letting water in the diffuser tube of the air diffuser flushes the diffuser tube. To perform such flushing, it is however necessary to place ancillary facility such as a flushing water tank and a flushing pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the membrane separator, the operation of the suction pump is stopped when the waste water flow is reduced and the amount of waste water in the tank is below a predetermined water level. In gravity filtration type that uses the water head in the tank as a driving pressure, the operation stops spontaneously when the amount of flow is reduced and the water head is lower than a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The amount of waste water flowing to the waste water treatment facility is not always constant. That is, the facility receiving a large daily variation or seasonal variation may have little or no daily amount of waste water flow in some cases and have an excessively large daily amount in some cases. Therefore, with respect to the aeration tank of a general waste water treatment facility, the ratings of the tank capacity and the air diffuser are set in such a redundant specification as to comply with an abnormally large waste water flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This contributes to a considerable variation of water level in the aeration tank between the time of a maximum load and the time of a minimum load of waste water flow. At the time of a low load, the operation of the membrane separator is brought to a stop. When the aeration of activated sludge with the air from the air diffuser is stopped for a long period of time, there may occur oxygen deficiency and insufficient stirring of the intra-tank mixed liquor. It is therefore necessary that only air diffusion operation for diffusing air from the air diffuser be performed in the state of stopping filtration operation of the membrane separator. However, this operation state causes damage to the filtration membranes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the membrane cartridges <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, during the period of time that the operation of the air diffuser is stopped, sludge flows to the diffuser tube through the blowholes. This sludge is dried with air during air diffusion operation, and the dried sludge causes clogging of the blowholes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention has for its object the provision of an air diffuser and a method of flushing an air diffuser that can structurally suppress a clogging of a diffuser tube and flush the diffuser tube by a simple manipulation. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To solve the foregoing problems, an air diffuser according to a first aspect of the invention comprises a diffuser tube having at its lower part a plurality of blowholes and being communicated at its basal end to an air supply source, the diffuser tube being immersed sidewardly in a tank; a flushing pipe being communicated at its basal end to a tip of the diffuser tube and opening at its tip as an outlet at an upper position of the diffuser tube; and a flushing valve disposed in the flushing pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> With this construction, during air diffusion operation, the flushing valve is closed so that the air to be supplied from the air supply source to the diffuser tube at a predetermined pressure is sprayed from the blowholes. This air aerates the intra-tank mixed liquor and supplies oxygen for biological treatment. This air also produces by its air lift action an upstream to stir the intra-tank mixed liquor, and acts as a traction on the membrane surfaces of a membrane separator, thereby flushing the membrane surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> During flushing operation, the flushing valve is opened so that the air to be supplied from the air supply source is discharged from the outlet via the flushing pipe under atmospheric pressure or a predetermined depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> At this time, the outlet is opened under atmospheric pressure or the predetermined depth. Thereby, the pressure within the diffuser tube is lowered and the back pressure in the outlet corresponds to the atmospheric pressure or the predetermined depth pressure. It follows that the back pressure of the blowholes locating below the outlet is greater than the back pressure of the outlet. As a result, the air within the diffuser tube flows to the outlet and the intra-tank mixed liquor flows from the blowholes to the diffuser tube that is low in pressure. The intra-tank mixed liquor running in the diffuser tube and the air pass through the diffuser tube and flush the diffuser tube. This intra-tank mixed liquor is then joined with sludge within the diffuser tube to enter the flushing pipe and come off together from the outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To the inner surface of the diffuser tube, sludge is attached which enters the diffuser tube when the operation of the air diffuser is stopped, and which is then dried by air passing through the diffuser tube during air diffusion. Infiltration of the intra-tank mixed liquor facilitates the release of the dry sludge from the inner surface of the diffuser tube. The released sludge is joined with the intra-tank mixed liquor to come off together from the outlet as the air is discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing action, when the intra-tank mixed liquor rapidly runs in the diffuser tube that is low in pressure via the blowholes, the resistance of the intra-tank mixed liquor increases the pressure within the diffuser tube to stop the flow of the intra-tank mixed liquor into the diffuser tube, and therefore, the intra-tank mixed liquor flowing from the diffuser tube to the flushing pipe is discharged from the outlet by air lift action. Thereby, the pressure within the diffuser tube is lowered and the intra-tank mixed liquor runs in the diffuser tube via the blowholes. The result of this is that pulsation occurs in the diffuser tube and the flushing pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> At the occurrence of pulsation, the pressure within the diffuser tube varies with repeated subjection to sharp increase and decrease. This produces intermittent occurrences of a flushing state that the intra-tank mixed liquor flows to the diffuser tube via the blowhole, and an air diffusion state that the flow of the intra-tank mixed liquor into the diffuser tube is stopped and part of the air blows off via the blowholes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> At the point that the air diffusion state changes to the flushing state, a rapid flow of the intra-tank mixed liquor occurs in the diffuser tube. Repeated occurrences of the rapid flow increases the effect of flushing the sludge attached to the inside of the diffuser tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An air diffuser according to a second aspect of the invention comprises: a diffuser tube immersed sidewardly in a tank; a flushing pipe opening at its tip as an outlet at an upper position of the diffuser tube; and a flushing valve disposed in the flushing pipe, the diffuser tube consisting of (i) a main pipe being communicated at its basal end to an air supply source and being communicated at its tip to the flushing pipe, and (ii) a plurality of branch pipes being communicated to the main pipe and opening at their tip as a blowhole at a lower position of the main pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With this construction, air diffusion operation and flushing operation are performed in the same manipulation as in the first aspect. During air diffusion operation, the air to be supplied to the diffuser tube passes through the main pipe to the branch pipes, and the air blows out from the blowholes disposed at the tip of the branch pipes. During flushing operation, the intra-tank mixed liquor flows from the blowholes to the branch pipes. This intra-tank mixed liquor is joined with air to pass through the branch pipes to the main pipe while flushing the inside of the diffuser tube, and then joined with cumulus deposit within the diffuser tube to come off together from the outlet via the flushing pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Since the opening at the tip of the branch pipes serves as the blowhole, the inside diameter of the branch pipes and the aperture of the blowhole are the same. This provides a shape having no variations in the sectional area of the passage. Also, there is no resistance to obstruct the fluid passing from the branch pipes via the blowholes to the exterior. Therefore, the sludge and intra-tank mixed liquor that remain in the branch pipes when changing from the flushing state to the air diffusion state, are quickly discharged to the outside of the branch pipes at the time of air diffusion. Otherwise, the resulting effects are the same as the first aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An air diffuser according to a third aspect of the invention comprises: a diffuser tube immersed sidewardly in a tank; a flushing pipe opening at its tip as an outlet at an upper position of the diffuser tube; and a flushing valve disposed in the flushing pipe, the diffuser tube consisting of (i) a main pipe communicated at its basal end to an air supply source and communicated at its tip to the flushing pipe, and (ii) a plurality of branch pipes being communicated to the main pipe and having at their upper side a plurality of blowholes of which aperture is smaller than the opening at their tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With this construction, air diffusion operation and flushing operation are performed in the same manipulation as the first aspect. During air diffusion operation, the air to be supplied to the diffuser tube passes through the main pipe to the branch pipes and then blows off from the blowholes of the respective branch pipes. The air passing through the branch pipes receives buoyancy due to a density difference with the intra-tank mixed liquor. Therefore, most of the air blows off from the blowholes, and the rest is discharged from the opening at their end. Since the blowholes have a small aperture, the small bubble (fine bubble) of the air blowing off therefrom have a small diameter, which increases the efficiency of oxygen dissolution. In addition, even if the blowholes spontaneously become clogged by sundry matter, sludge of low flowability, large flock and the like, a predetermined amount of air for aeration is ensured by the air blowing off from the opening at the tips of the branch pipes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> During flushing operation, the intra-tank mixed liquor flows from the opening at the tip of the branch pipes and from the blowholes to the branch pipes. This intra-tank mixed liquor is joined with air to pass through the branch pipes to the main pipe while flushing the inside of the diffuser tube, and then joined with cumulus deposit within the diffuser tube to come off together from the outlet via the flushing pipe. Otherwise, the resulting effects are the same as the first aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A preferred air diffuser of the invention has a sensor means to measure the water level in the tank, and a control means to open the flushing valve at a particular time when the sensor means detects that the water level is below a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With this construction, the control means can switch air diffusion operation and flushing operation by opening/closing the flushing valve. At such a particular time that the amount of waste water flowing to the tank is below the predetermined value, flushing operation can be performed automatically. Flushing operation performed at that particular time prevents excessive air diffusion and also performs flushing of the diffuser tube. Further, even if a slight flow of waste water continues for a long period of time, the intra-tank mixed liquor is stirred in the air diffusion state to be produced intermittently, and oxygen can be supplied to activated sludge. In addition, in the flushing state, the intra-tank mixed liquor is joined with air to flow together through the diffuser tube and flushing pipe, so that sufficient oxygen is dissolved in the intra-tank mixed liquor. Therefore, by returning the intra-tank mixed liquor discharged from the flushing pipe to the inside of the tank, the oxygen supply to the intra-tank mixed liquor and the stirring of the intra-tank indexed liquor are performable even in the flushing state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Other preferred air diffuser of the invention has a control means to open the flushing valve at predetermined time-spaced intervals at which a timer is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With this construction, the control means performs switching between the air diffusion operation and the flushing operation by opening/closing the flushing valve. The flushing operation is performed automatically at predetermined time-spaced intervals, thereby flushing the inside of the diffuser tube in the flushing state to be produced intermittently, while ensuring a minimum required amount of air diffusion in the air diffusion state to be produced intermittently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to a method of flushing an air diffuser of the invention, during air diffusion, air is supplied from an air supply source with a flushing valve closed and the air is diffused from blowholes, and, during flushing, air is supplied from the air supply source with the flushing valve opened and an intra-tank mixed liquor is sucked from each opening of a diffuser tube, so that the inside of the diffuser tube is flushed with the sucked intra-tank mixed liquor, and the intra-tank mixed liquor is then joined with the air to come off together from an outlet of a flushing pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred method of flushing an air diffuser of the invention, the air diffusion from the blowholes and the flushing of the diffuser tube are alternately repeated by utilizing pulsation to be caused by pressure variations in the diffuser tube during flushing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> First Preferred Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A first preferred embodiment will be described below based on the accompanying drawings. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an air diffuser <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> disposed above the air diffuser <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are immersed in an aeration tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for performing membrane separation activated sludge treatment. A variety of separation membranes, such as organic flat membrane type, tube type and ceramic type, are usable for the membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Hereat, there are used a plurality of membrane cartridges using organic flat membrane type separation membrane (filtration membrane), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The membrane cartridges are oriented vertically and in parallel with each other at predetermined spaced intervals to form a passage between the adjacent membrane cartridges. The membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is removably connected via a coupling <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to a passage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provided with a suction pump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and is activated by a pump suction pressure as a driving pressure. As the driving pressure, the water head in the tank (gravity) can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A diffuser casing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the air diffuser <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is disposed below the membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to surround its lower region, and a diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is located at a lower position of the diffuser case <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is made up of a main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> composed of a large-diameter pipe having a predetermined aperture and extending horizontally, and a plurality of branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed by small-diameter pipes, each having a predetermined aperture and locating underneath the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is communicated at its basal end to a blower <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that is an air supply source, and is connected at its tip to a flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> extending vertically. Each branch pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is in an inverted T-shape and communicated, at one end of its upper part, to the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Both ends of each branch pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which are located beneath the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, form a blowhole <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Instead of being restricted to the above construction, the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can have various constructions as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The details will be discussed later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The tip of the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is opened at an upper position of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as an outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is interposed in the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In the first preferred embodiment, the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is opened under atmospheric pressure above water surface. The outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be placed under water surface. The diffuser case <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fixed to a tank bottom face <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can move up and down along a guide <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> disposed between the diffuser case <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a tank opening <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the aeration tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, there are a waste water supply pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> supplying waste water and a water level gauge <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> measuring the water level of the aeration tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The water level gauge <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and an arithmetic circuit contained in a controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> form a sensor means for detecting the amount of waste water flow. In the arithmetic circuit of the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the current waste water flow is obtained by calculating a displacement of water level in unit time based on the output value of the water level gauge <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and dividing the displacement by the area of the tank bottom of the aeration tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a function of opening the flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a particular time that the amount of waste water flow is below a predetermined value, or at predetermined time-spaced intervals at which a self-contained timer is set. This function is embodied by an electric circuit, an integrated circuit, or a program stored on a semiconductor device. The controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also controls start/stop of the suction pump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the blower <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The operation in the above construction will be described below. During normal air diffusion operation, the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> closes the flushing, valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that air having a predetermined pressure is supplied from the blower <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The air passes through the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the respective branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and then blows off from the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the intra-tank mixed liquor in the aeration tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> This diffused air aerates the intra-tank mixed liquor and also generates an upstream of gas-liquid-solid mixed phase. The upstream stirs by its lift the intra-tank mixed liquor and supplies the intra-tank mixed liquor to the passage between the adjacent membrane cartridges of the membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as the crossflow. The membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> performs filtration by allowing the intra-tank mixed liquor to pass through the filtration membranes of the membrane cartridges. The upstream flows, as a traction, on the membrane surfaces, thereby suppressing cake from attaching to the membrane surfaces of the membrane cartridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> measures continuously the amount of waste water flow based on the value obtained by the water level gauge <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and performs flushing operation at a particular time that the amount of waste water flow from the waste water supply pipe <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is below a predetermined value, or performs flushing operation at predetermined spaced-time intervals at which the timer is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the former flushing operation, the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> stops the suction pump <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to stop the operation of the membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the latter flushing operation, the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides a continuous operation of the membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In both flushing operations, the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> opens the flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the air supplied from the blower <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> passes through the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and comes off from the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> under atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> At this time, the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is opened under atmospheric pressure at an upper position of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are opened at a lower position of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, the main flow of the air passing through the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> flows to the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that has a smaller back pressure and a smaller resistance than the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, with respect to pressure P<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> exerted on the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (which is determined by the water level in the tank), pressure (static pressure) P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> exerted on the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is lowered and the intra-tank mixed liquor passes through the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the inside of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The intra-tank mixed liquor running in the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> flushes the sludge attached to the inside of the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the inside of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This intra-tank mixed liquor then joins with the air passing through the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to enter the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to come off from the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> To the inner surface of the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, sludge is attached which enters the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> when the operation of the blower <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the air diffuser <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is stopped, and which is then dried by the air passing through the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> during air diffusion. Infiltration of the intra-tank mixed liquor facilitates the release of the dry sludge from the inner surface of the pipe. The released sludge is joined with the intra-tank mixed liquor to come off together from the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as the air is discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the intra-tank mixed liquor rapidly runs in the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that is low in pressure via the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the resistance of the intra-tank mixed liquor increases the pressure within the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to stop the flow of the intra-tank mixed liquor into the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The intra-tank mixed liquor flowing from the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is discharged from the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by air lift action, so that the pressure within the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is lowered and the intra-tank mixed liquor runs in the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The result of this is that pulsation occurs in the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> At the occurrence of pulsation, the pressure within the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> varies with repeated subjection to sharp increase and decrease. This produces intermittent occurrences of a flushing state that the intra-tank mixed liquor flows to the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and an air diffusion state that the flow of the intra-tank mixed liquor to the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is stopped and part of the air blows off via the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> At the point that the air diffusion state changes to the flushing state, a rapid flow of the intra-tank mixed liquor occurs in the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Repetitive occurrence of the rapid flow increases the effect of flushing the sludge attached to the inside of the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The openings at the tip of the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> serve as the blowhole <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the inner diameter of the branch pipes and the aperture of the blowhole <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are the same. This provides a shape having no variations in the sectional area of the passage. Also, there is no resistance to obstruct the fluid passing through the inside of the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the exterior. Therefore, the sludge and intra-tank nixed liquor that remain in the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> when changing from the flushing state to the air diffusion state, are quickly discharged to the outside of the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> during air diffusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Thus, the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> opens/closes the flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to automatically perform switching between the air diffusion operation and the flushing operation. Therefore, the flushing operation can be performed automatically at a particular time that waste water flow is below a predetermined value, or at predetermined time-spaced intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The flushing operation at that particular time prevents excessive air diffusion that adversely affects the filtration membranes of the membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and also performs flushing of the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Further, even if a slight flow of waste water continues for a long period of time, the intra-tank mixed liquor is stirred in the air diffusion state to be produced intermittently, and oxygen can be supplied to activated sludge. In addition, in the flushing state, the intra-tank mixed liquor joins with air to flow together through the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, so that sufficient oxygen is dissolved in the intra-tank mixed liquor. Therefore, by returning the intra-tank mixed liquor discharged from the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the aeration tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the oxygen supply to the intra-tank mixed liquor and the stirring of the intra-tank mixed liquor are performable even in the flushing state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Thus, without repeating the operation of opening/closing of the flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, once open the flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is a simple manipulation, the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is subjected to repetitive flushing by using pulsation generated in the inside of the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. This avoids that the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> become clogged by dry sludge. As auxiliary facility, neither a flushing water tank nor a flushing pump is necessary, which have conventionally been required. This leads to a reduction in the load on the maintenance operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Although in this preferred embodiment the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> controls to open/close the flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the open/close of the flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be accomplished with manual operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Second Preferred Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A second preferred embodiment is basically identical with that shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the first preferred embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an important part of a diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that is an important part of the second preferred embodiment. In the following, the same references have been used as in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and their detail description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in an inverted T-shape, which is communicated, at one end in its upper part, to the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> have an opening <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>locating at each end beneath the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>locating at its upper part and having a smaller aperture than the opening <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Operation in the above construction will be described below. Air diffusion operation and flushing operation are performed in the same manipulation as the first preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> During air diffusion operation in which the flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is closed, the air to be supplied from the blower <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> passes through the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the air then blows off from the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> into the intra-tank mixed liquor in the aeration tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> At this time, the air passing through the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> receives buoyancy due to a density difference with the intra-tank mixed liquor. Therefore, most of the air blows off from the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the rest is discharged from the opening <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the tip. Since the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have a small aperture, the small bubble (fine bubble) of the air blowing off therefrom has a small diameter, which increases the efficiency of oxygen dissolution. The improved efficiency of oxygen dissolution reduces the size of the blower <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as an air source, thus permitting a reduction in power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> It is necessary that the total amount of air diffused from the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> be controlled to a predetermined amount. Therefore, as the aperture of the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is increased, the number of the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>must be reduced. However, in the second preferred embodiment, the number of the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be increased by reducing their aperture. Thereby, the degree of dispersion of the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the aeration tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be increased to uniformly diffuse the aerated air and increase the effect of flushing the membrane surfaces of the membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In addition, even if the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are spontaneously clogged by sundry matter, sludge of low flowability, large flock and the like, the air blowing off from the openings <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the tip of the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> ensures a predetermined amount of air for aeration to continue flushing of the membrane surfaces of the membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This avoids that the membrane cartridges become clogged by insufficient flushing before the next flushing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> During flushing operation, the intra-tank mixed liquor passing through the openings <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the tips of the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This intra-tank mixed liquor is joined with air to pass through the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, while flushing the inside of the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and it is then joined with cumulus deposit within the diffuser tube to come off together from the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the flushing, pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> At this time, in the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the internal pressure of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> varies with repeated subjection to sharp increase and decrease. This provides repetitively rapid flow of the intra-tank mixed liquor to the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. As a result, the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, openings <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are repetitively flushed for effective removal of sludge. This allows for a reduction in the aperture of the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the branch pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that are liable to become clogged by dry sludge. Otherwise, the resulting effects are the same as the first preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Third Preferred Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A third preferred embodiment has the same basic construction as that shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the first preferred embodiment. A diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that is an important part of the third preferred embodiment will be described. In the following, the same references have been used as in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and their detailed description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be formed only by a main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are disposed in a lower part of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> With this construction, during normal air diffusion operation, the air supplied from the blower <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> blows off from the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the intra-tank mixed liquor in the aeration tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, with the flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> During flushing operation, in the state of supplying air of a predetermined pressure from the blower <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the flushing valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is opened and the air supplied to the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is discharged under atmospheric pressure from the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> At this time, the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is opened under atmospheric pressure at an upper position of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are opened at a lower position of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the main flow of the air flow in the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is directed to the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a smaller resistance, and the pressure (static pressure) exerted on the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is lowered. As a result, the intra-tank mixed liquor passes through the blowholes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the inside of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The entered intra-tank mixed liquor flowing along with the air passing through the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> flushes the sludge attached to the inside of the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and then comes off together from the outlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the resulting effects are the same as the first preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is preferably shaped according to the size of the aeration tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the size of the membrane separator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For example, the diffuser tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can have the following shapes. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed in a U-shape. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is bent several times, and the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is connected to its intermediate point, and the air supply source is connected to its both ends. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the main pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed into a loop, and the flushing pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is connected to its intermediate point, and the air supply source is connected to the opposite position of the intermediate point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been shown and described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is therefore understood that numerous modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
