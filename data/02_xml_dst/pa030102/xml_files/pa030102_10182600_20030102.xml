<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a timing generation apparatus for a display apparatus and a display apparatus in which the timing generation circuit is incorporated, and more particularly to a timing generation circuit which generates various timing pulses for controlling a driving system of a display apparatus of the active matrix type and a display apparatus of the active matrix type in which the timing generation circuit is incorporated. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, portable terminals such as portable telephone sets and PDA (Personal Digital Assistants) have been popularized remarkably. One of factors of such rapid popularization of portable terminals is considered a liquid crystal display apparatus incorporated as an output display section of the portable terminals. The reason is that the liquid crystal display apparatus has a characteristic that high power for driving the same is not required in principle and is a display device of low power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A display apparatus of a configuration wherein pixels are disposed in rows and columns (in a matrix) and are driven individually such as such a liquid crystal display apparatus as described above includes a vertical driving system for selecting the pixels in a unit of a row and a horizontal driving system for writing information into each of the pixels of the row selected by the vertical driving system. Various timing pulses for driving control of the driving systems are used by them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The timing pulses are generated at suitable timings based on a horizontal synchronizing signal HD, a vertical synchronizing signal VD and a master clock signal MCK using a timing signal producing counter circuit for exclusive use or the like. The timing pulse generation circuit for generating the timing pulses is conventionally formed on a single crystal silicon substrate which is separate from a substrate on which a display area section is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Where, in a display apparatus represented by a liquid crystal display apparatus, a timing generation circuit for generating various timing signals to be used for display driving is formed on a substrate separate from a substrate on which a display area section is formed as described above, the number of parts for forming the set increases and they must be produced through separate processes. Therefore, there is a problem that miniaturization and reduction of the cost of the set are obstructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a timing generation circuit for a display apparatus which can contribute to miniaturization and reduction of the cost of a set and a display apparatus in which the timing generation circuit is incorporated. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to attain the object described above, according to the present invention, in a display apparatus which includes a display area section wherein pixels each having an electro-optical element are disposed in rows and columns, a vertical driving circuit for selecting the pixels of the display area section in a unit of a row, and a horizontal driving circuit for supplying an image signal to each of the pixels in the row selected by the vertical driving circuit, a timing generation circuit is configured such that it produces a timing signal to be used by at least one of the vertical driving circuit and the horizontal driving circuit based on timing information produced by at least one of the vertical driving circuit and the horizontal driving circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> That a timing signal is generated based on timing information produced by at least one of the vertical driving circuit and the horizontal driving circuit in the timing generation circuit of the configuration described above or in a display apparatus in which the timing generation circuit is incorporated signifies that part of at least one of the vertical driving circuit and the horizontal driving circuit is used for production of the timing signal. Accordingly, the circuit configuration of the timing generation circuit can be simplified by the circuit portion used also for the production of the timing signal.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and an Nch MOS transistor Qn<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are connected in series between the power supply from which the single DC power supply voltage VCC is supplied and the ground (GND), and have the gates connected commonly thereby to form a CMOS inverter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The timing pulse supplied from the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is applied as a switching pulse to the gate common node of the CMOS inverter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A terminal of a capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to a drain common node (node B) of the CMOS inverter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The other terminal of the capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to the drain of an Nch MOS transistor Qn<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the source of a Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A load capacitor C<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected between the source of the Nch MOS transistor Qn<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A terminal of a capacitor C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to the gate common node of the CMOS inverter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The other terminal of the capacitor C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to the anode of a diode D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Further, the gates of the Nch MOS transistor Qn<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are connected to the other terminal of the capacitor C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The drain of the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is grounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected between the other terminal of the capacitor C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the ground. To the gate of the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the timing pulse supplied from the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, that is, the clamping pulse, is supplied after it is level-shifted by a level shift circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the level shift circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> form a clamp circuit for clamping a switching pulse voltage for the switching transistors (Nch MOS transistor Qn<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the clamp circuit, the level shift circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> uses the DC power supply voltage VCC inputted to the D/D converter as a positive side circuit power supply and uses an output voltage Vout of the D/D converter derived from the opposite terminals of the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a negative side circuit power supply, and level-shifts the clamping pulse of an amplitude VCC&minus;0 &lsqb;V&rsqb; supplied from the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to a clamping pulse of another amplitude VCC-Vout &lsqb;V&rsqb; and applies the level-shifted clamping pulse to the gate of the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the switching operation of the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is performed with a higher degree of certainty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Now, circuit operation of the charge pump type D/D converter of the negative voltage generation type having the configuration described above is described with reference to a timing chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In this timing chart, waveforms A to G represent signal waveforms at the nodes A to G of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Upon starting of power supply (upon starting), the output potential of the capacitor C<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> based on the switching pulse supplied from the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, that is, the potential at the node D, is &ldquo;H&rdquo;-level-clamped at a potential level-shifted by a threshold voltage Vth of the diode D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the ground (GND) level which is the negative side circuit power supply potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Then, when the switching pulse has the &ldquo;L&rdquo; level (0 V), since the Pch MOS transistors Qp<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> exhibit an on state, the capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is charged. At this time, since the Nch MOS transistor Qn<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is in an off state, the potential at the node B is equal to the VCC level. Then, when the switching pulse changes to the &ldquo;H&rdquo; level (VCC), the Nch MOS transistors Qn<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and Qn<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are placed into an on state and the potential at the node B becomes equal to the ground level (0 V). Consequently, the potential at the node C becomes equal to the &minus;VCC level. The potential at the node C passes as it is through the Nch MOS transistor Qn<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and makes the output voltage Vout (&equals;&minus;VCC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Then, when the output voltage Vout rises to some degree (upon completion of the starting process), the level shift circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for the clamping pulse starts its operation. After the level shift circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> starts its operation, the clamping pulse of the amplitude VCC&minus;0 &lsqb;V&rsqb; supplied from the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is level-shifted to the claming pulse of the amplitude VCC&minus;Vout &lsqb;V&rsqb; by the level shift circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, whereafter it is applied to the gate of the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> At this time, since the &ldquo;L&rdquo; level of the clamping pulse is the output voltage Vout, that is, &minus;VCC, the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> assumes an on state with certainty. Consequently, the potential at the node D is clamped not at the potential level-shifted by the threshold voltage Vth of the diode D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the ground level but at the ground level (negative side circuit power supply potential). Consequently, in a later pumping operation of the charge pump circuit, a sufficient driving voltage particularly for the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In the charge pump type D/D converter of the configuration described above, a clamping operation of the control pulse (switching pulse) voltage for the switching elements (Nch MOS transistor Qn<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) provided at the outputting section of the charge pump type D/D converter is performed divisionally in two stages including clamping by the diode D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> first and claming by the clamp circuit formed from the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the level shift circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> after completion of the starting process. Therefore, a sufficient driving voltage particularly for the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Consequently, since sufficient switching current is obtained from the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a stabilized DC-DC conversion operation can be performed and the conversion efficiency can be augmented. Particularly, since sufficient switching current can be obtained even if the transistor size of the Pch MOS transistor Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not increased, a power supply voltage conversion circuit of high current capacity can be realized with a circuit scale of a small area. This effect is particularly high where a transistor having a high threshold voltage Vth, for example, a thin film transistor, is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> A configuration of a charge pump type D/D converter of the boost type is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Also the D/D converter of the boost type is similar in basic circuit configuration and circuit operation to the D/D converter of the negative voltage generation type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In particular, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the charge pump type D/D converter of the boost type is configured such that the switching transistors and the clamping transistor (MOS transistors Qp<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, Qn<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and Qn<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) have conduction types opposite to those of the MOS transistors Qn<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, Qp<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and Qp<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and the diode D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected between the other terminal of the capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the power supply (VCC) and besides the level shift circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> uses the output voltage Vout of the present circuit as a positive side circuit power supply and uses the ground level as a negative side circuit power supply, and is different in this regard from the configuration of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The charge pump type D/D converter of the boost type is basically quite same also in circuit operation as the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The circuit operation is different only in that the switching pulse voltage (control pulse voltage) is first clamped by a diode upon starting and then clamped, after the starting process comes to an end, at the VCC level (positive side circuit power supply potential), and a voltage value <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&times;VCC which is twice the power supply voltage VCC is derived as the output voltage Vout. A timing chart of the signal waveforms A to G at the nodes A to G in the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The circuit configuration of the charge pump type D/D converter described above is a mere example, and the circuit configuration of the charge pump circuit can be modified in various forms and is not limited to the example of the circuit configuration described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, while, in the first and second embodiments described above, the latch control pulse used by the latch circuits <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>D of the H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D and the switching pulse and the clamping pulse used by the power supply circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed from a charge pump type power supply voltage conversion circuit are taken as an example of the timing pulses generated by the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the timing pulses generated by the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are not limited to them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As an example, where the V driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is configured such that it includes an output enable circuit which outputs a scanning pulse when an output enable pulse is received, the output enable pulse used by the output enable circuit may be generated by the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, or where the display apparatus is configured such that it selectively takes a partial screen display mode wherein it displays information only in part of an area of the display area section thereof, which is a form of a power saving mode, a control signal (control pulse) for the partial screen display mode may be generated by the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, usually two transfer clocks of the opposite phases to each other are applied to each transfer state of a shift register which forms the H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D or the V driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. However, where a configuration wherein two-phase transfer clocks are transmitted by two clock lines and supplied to each transfer stages of a shift register is adopted, since the two clock lines cross each other without fail while they transmit the two-phase transfer clocks to each transfer stages of the shift register, there is the possibility that the power consumption may be increased and some delay in phase may be caused by load capacitance arising from the crossing portion of the wiring lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Besides, in the H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D, for example, in the case of a digital interface drive circuit, since it is configured such that it includes, in addition to the shift registers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>D, sampling latch circuits <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>D, the line sequencing latch circuits <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>D and D/A conversion circuits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>D as described hereinabove, the two clock lines for individually transmitting the two-phase transfer clocks cross each other at many locations, and there is the possibility that the power consumption may be increased and some delay in phase may be caused by the load capacitance at the crossing locations. They appear particularly significantly with the H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D because the transfer frequency is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Third Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Taking this into consideration, a display apparatus according to a third embodiment described below, for example, a liquid crystal display apparatus of the active matrix type, has been configured. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an example of a configuration of the liquid crystal display apparatus of the active matrix type according to the third embodiment of the present invention, and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, like elements to those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are denoted by like reference characters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display apparatus of the active matrix type according to the present embodiment, it is premised that, in the H driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed on the outermost side with respect to the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further, of various timing signals generated by the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the horizontal transfer clock HCK is a single phase clock obtained by dividing the master clock MCK into two. Here, the master clock MCK is a clock (dot clock) of a frequency which depends upon the number of pixels (dots) of the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the horizontal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The single phase horizontal transfer clock HCK is supplied through a buffer circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to a clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> wired on the further outer side than the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with respect to the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is wired along a transfer (shift) direction of the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and supplies the single phase horizontal transfer clock HCK to the individual transfer stages of the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Where the liquid crystal display apparatus of the active matrix type is configured such that the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed on the outermost side with respect to the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for transmitting the single phase horizontal transfer clock HCK is wired on the further outer side than the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in this manner, the clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be wired without intersecting with output wiring lines from the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the sampling latch circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the next stage to the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the wiring line capacitance of the clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be suppressed low, and therefore, the frequency of the horizontal transfer clock HCK can be increased and reduction of the power consumption can be anticipated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Particularly since the single phase horizontal transfer clock HCK is a clock signal obtained by dividing the dot clock into two, the frequency of the horizontal transfer clock HCK is one half that of the dock clock, and therefore, further reduction of the power consumption can be achieved by the reduction of the clock frequency. Further, since high speed circuit operation is possible, where it is intended to further raise the resolution, a single H driver can deal with this without the necessity for disposition of a plurality of H drivers for parallel processing, and consequently, a display unit of a high resolution can be implemented without increasing the number of terminals of an interface or without performing parallel processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> (Particular Example of the Shift Register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an example of a particular circuit configuration of the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Here, only a transfer stage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of the nth stage and another transfer stage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n&plus;</italic></highlight>1 of the n&plus;1th stage are shown for the simplification of the drawing. However, also the other transfer stages have the quite same configuration. Further, for description of a particular configuration, description is given taking the transfer stage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of the nth stage as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is connected between the clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the transfer stage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of the nth stage. The switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> performs on (closing)/off (opening) operation under the control of a clock selection control circuit which is hereinafter described thereby to act to selectively supply the horizontal transfer clock HCK transmitted thereto by the clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to the transfer stage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of the nth stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The transfer stage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of the nth stage includes a latch circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for latching the horizontal transfer clock HCK selectively supplied thereto through the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a buffer circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> for supplying a latch pulse of the latch circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the sampling latch circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>U of the next stage, and a clock selection control circuit, for example, an OR circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for controlling the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> between on and off based on a latch pulse Ain of the preceding stage and a latch pulse Aout of the self stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Now, circuit operation of the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having the configuration described above is described with reference to a timing chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> When the latch pulse Ain is inputted from the transfer stage of the preceding stage (n&minus;1th stage), the latch pulse Ain passes through the OR circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and is supplied to the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to cause the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to perform a switching on operation. Consequently, the horizontal transfer clock HCK transmitted by the clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is supplied to the transfer stage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of the nth stage through the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and is latched by the latch circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> After the latch pulse Ain disappears, the latch pulse Aout of the latch circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the self stage is supplied through the OR circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to keep the on state of the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Then, when also the latch pulse Aout of the self stage disappears, the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is switched into an off state. It is to be noted that, as can be seen apparently from the timing chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, some delay (&Dgr;t) corresponding to a time required for the horizontal transfer clock HCK to pass through the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the latch circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> appears between the horizontal transfer clock HCK and the latch pulse Aout or Bout of each stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Where the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is connected between the clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for transmitting the single phase horizontal transfer clock HCK and each transfer stage of the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and only the switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in the transfer stage which requires the horizontal transfer clock HCK performs a switching on operation in this manner, since the clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is selectively connected to the individual transfer stages only when this is required, further reduction of the wiring capacitance of the clock line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for each transfer stage can be anticipated. As a result, higher speed circuit operation of the shift register <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be anticipated and further reduction of the power consumption can be anticipated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, since the transfer stage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of the nth stage latches a pulse of the positive polarity of the horizontal transfer clock HCK, the latch output of the latch circuit thereof directly makes the latch pulse Aout, but since the next transfer stage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n&plus;</italic></highlight>1 latches a pulse of the negative polarity of the horizontal transfer clock HCK, the latch pulse of the latch circuit thereof is inverted in polarity by an inverter circuit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> to make a latch pulse Bout. Also in the present circuit example, a clock obtained by dividing the dot clock into two is used as the single phase horizontal transfer clock HCK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Further, while the shift register in the present circuit example has been described taking the case wherein each transfer stage is formed from a latch circuit and a clock selection control circuit as an example, it is possible to form each transfer stage using a clocked inverter in place of a latch circuit. However, while a latch circuit usually has a circuit configuration wherein two inverters are connected in parallel and in the opposite directions to each other, since a clocked inverter is configured such that a switching transistor is disposed on the power supply side/ground side of the latch circuit, the former circuit configuration has an advantage that a higher speed circuit can be implemented as the number of transistors is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, while, in the present embodiment, description is given taking a case wherein the present invention is applied to a liquid crystal display apparatus wherein the H driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is disposed only on the upper side with respect to the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as an example, the present invention can be applied also to another liquid crystal display apparatus wherein the H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D are disposed on the upper and lower sides with respect to the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> similarly as in the first and second embodiments. An example of a configuration in this instance is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Where the configuration wherein the pair of upper and lower H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D are disposed with respect to the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is taken in this manner, there is an advantage that generally the frame area can be reduced. This is because, since the frame area is required essentially, where H drivers which require an equal circuit area to each other are disposed discretely on the opposite sides, the required minimum frame areas can be utilized more effectively than where such H drivers are disposed on only one side, and consequently, the total area of the frame areas on the opposite sides can be reduced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, as one of driving methods for a liquid crystal apparatus of the active matrix type, a common reversal driving method is known. Here, the common reversal driving method is a driving method wherein a counter-electrode voltage (common voltage) Vcom to be applied to the counter-electrode of a liquid crystal cell of each pixel commonly to the pixels is reversed for each 1H (H is a horizontal scanning period). Where the common reversal driving method is used together with, for example, a 1H reversal driving method wherein the polarity of an image signal to be applied to each pixel is reversed for each 1H, since also the polarity of the counter-electrode voltage Vcom is reversed for each 1H together with the polarity reversal of the image signal for 1H, reduction of the power supply voltage for the horizontal driving system (H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D) can be anticipated. </paragraph>

Accordingly, only the capacitor <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> should be produced outside the glass substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while the remaining circuit elements, that is, the switch circuit <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the DC voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, are formed integrally on the same glass substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as that the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In this instance, since the TFT is used for the pixel transistors of the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the TFT should be used also for the transistor which composes the switch circuit <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the counter-electrode voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> An example of a common configuration of a reference voltage generation circuit for generating such reference voltages V<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to V<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. The reference voltage generation circuit according to the present configuration example includes two switch circuits <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for switching the positive side power supply voltage VCC and the negative side power supply voltage VSS with the opposite phases to each other in a fixed period, and n&plus;1 resistors R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to Rn connected in series between output terminals of the switch circuits <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In the reference voltage generation circuit having the configuration described above, the buffer circuits <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>have an impedance conversion function. They act to prevent a dispersion in writing characteristic from appearing between the upper and lower H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D even if, where the present reference voltage generation circuit is formed in a substrate separate from the glass substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such that a reference voltage is transmitted to the D/A conversion circuit on the glass substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the wiring line impedance becomes high because the wiring line lengths from the reference voltage generation circuit to the D/A conversion circuits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>D become long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, on the liquid crystal display apparatus of the active matrix type according to the present embodiment, since the reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is integrated on the same glass substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> together with the H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D, the wiring line lengths between the reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D can be set very short. Particularly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, upon integration of the reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, where the reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed at a substantially middle position of the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the vertical direction, that is, at a position at a substantially equal distance from the upper and lower H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D, the wiring line lengths to the H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D can be set substantially equal to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Consequently, when the reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is configured, the buffer circuits <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>used in the common circuit example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> are not required as seen from a circuit diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, like elements to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> are denoted by like reference characters.

The reason why the positive side power supply voltage VCC and the negative side power supply voltage VSS are switched with the opposite phases to each other in a fixed period, for example, in a 1H period, in this manner is that it is intended to AC drive (in the present example, 1H reversal drive) the liquid crystal in order to prevent deterioration of the liquid crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Further, upon integration of the reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, since a TFT is used for the pixel transistors of the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, if a TFT is used also for the transistors which form the switch circuits <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and at least the transistor circuits of the same are produced on the glass substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> together with the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, then the reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be produced readily and besides at a low cost.

<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Where the output voltage VA generated by the counter-electrode voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is used as one of the reference voltages to be applied from the reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the D/A conversion circuits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>D in this manner, since some of the functions of the reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be substituted by the counter-electrode voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the switch circuit <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the reference voltage generation circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> can be omitted. Accordingly, since the circuit scale can be reduced as much, further miniaturization and reduction in cost of the present liquid crystal display apparatus can be anticipated. While it is described that, in the present example, the output voltage VA is used as the reference voltage for a white signal (or the reference signal for a black signal), it is also possible to use the counter-electrode voltage Vcom itself as such. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in the display apparatus of the active matrix type wherein a polycrystalline silicon TFT is used as a switching element for a pixel, there is a tendency that a driving circuit which uses a polycrystalline silicon TFT is formed integrally on the glass substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> same as that of the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as described hereinabove. The display apparatus of the active matrix type wherein a driving circuit which uses a polycrystalline silicon TFT is formed integrally in this manner is very promising as a technique which allows miniaturization, high definition and high reliability. Since the polycrystalline silicon TFT has a mobility higher by two digits when compared with the amorphous silicon TFT, it allows integral formation of the driving circuit on the same substrate as that of the display area section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, since the polycrystalline silicon TFT is, when compared with the single crystal silicon transistor, lower in mobility, higher in threshold voltage Vth and greater in dispersion of the threshold voltage Vth, it has a problem that it cannot be used to form a circuit which operates at a high speed or a circuit which uses a low voltage. Since a great variation of the threshold voltage Vth makes it difficult particularly to form a differential circuit for which a pair of transistors having same characteristics are required, it makes a very significant problem to circuit design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The dispersion of the threshold voltage Vth is related to the fact that the back gate potential of the TFT is the high impedance. In particular, since a conventional TFT has one of the bottom gate structure and the top gate structure as a gate structure thereof, the back gate of the transistor exhibits a high impedance and makes the dispersion of the threshold voltage Vth great. Accordingly, it is very difficult to use the TFT having such a characteristic as just described to produce a low voltage circuit or a small signal amplitude circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, a structure wherein a gate electrode is provided also on the back gate side of a transistor and is connected to the front side gate electrode, that is, a structure wherein, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31, a</cross-reference> pair of gate electrodes, that is, a front gate electrode <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a back gate electrode <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are disposed on the opposite sides of a channel area <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> between a source area <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and a drain area <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and are connected to each other by a contact portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (the structure described is hereinafter referred to as dual gate structure), has been proposed. The TFT of the dual gate structure has an advantage that the dispersion of the threshold voltage Vth can be suppressed small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> However, with the TFT of the dual gate structure, since it is necessary to provide a contact area including the contact portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for connecting the pair of gate electrodes <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> to each other as apparently seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, the area required for configuration of a device is great. Accordingly, where the TFT of the dual gate structure is used to produce a driving circuit, a very great circuit area is required, and as a result, the frame of the display apparatus (peripheral area of the display area section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) becomes great. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Here, in the display apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the H drivers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>U and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>D, V driver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are circuits which handle a signal of a small amplitude. It is to be noted that, though not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> clock I/F circuit and a synchronizing signal I/F circuit for fetching the master clock MCK, horizontal synchronizing signal HD and vertical synchronizing signal VD supplied from the outside of the substrate are provided at the input stage of the timing generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Also the I/F circuits are circuits which handle a signal of a small amplitude. Further, also a CPU I/F circuit and so forth are listed as circuits which handle a signal of a small amplitude. Such circuits which handle a signal of a small amplitude as mentioned above are circuits with which it is desired to minimize the dispersion of the threshold voltage Vth of a transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the power supply circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, counter-electrode voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and reference voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are circuits which handle a power supply voltage. Such circuits which handle a power supply voltage as just mentioned are circuits with which it is desired to raise the current capacity of a transistor as high as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the liquid crystal display apparatus of the active matrix type according to the present embodiment, at least one of those circuits which handle a signal of a small amplitude or those circuits which handle a power supply voltage, or some of the circuits which handle a signal of a small amplitude or some of the circuits which handle a power supply voltage are produced using a TFT of the dual gate structure while the other circuits are produced using a TFT of the top gate structure or the bottom gate structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Since the TFT of the dual gate structure has a superior characteristic that the dispersion of the threshold voltage Vth is small, a transistor circuit formed using the dual gate TFT has augmented reliability, and therefore, the TFT of the dual gate structure is useful where it is used to produce a circuit which handles a signal of a small amplitude, particularly a circuit wherein transistors operate in pair, that is, which includes a pair of transistors having substantially same characteristics, such as, for example, a differential circuit or a current mirror circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> However, a TFT of the dual gate structure requires provision of a contact area for connecting the front gate electrode and the back gate electrode to each other and requires a great area to form the element. Therefore, if the dual gate TFT is used to produce all circuits, then the circuit scale becomes very great. Accordingly, of circuits which handle a signal of a small amplitude, a minimum number of necessary circuits such as a circuit which includes transistors which operate in pair are produced using the dual gate TFT while the other circuits are produced using a TFT of the top gate structure or the bottom gate structure whose required area is small. This makes it possible to form circuits whose dispersion of the threshold voltage Vth is small and which have a high degree of reliability without making the circuit scale great. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Further, since the TFT of the dual gate structure is equivalent to a transistor formed with a greater size although it has a smaller area in plane and has an advantage that it has a high current capacity, where the dual gate TFT is used to produce a circuit which handles a power supply voltage, the current capacity of the circuit can be raised. However, similarly to the case described above, if the dual gate TFT is used to produce all circuits, then since the circuit scale becomes very great, a necessary minimum number of circuits are produced using the dual gate TFT while the other circuits are produced using a TFT of the top gate structure or the bottom gate structure. Consequently, a circuit having a high current capacity can be formed without making the circuit scale great. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Here, particular structures of a TFT of the bottom gate structure, a TFT of the top gate structure and a TFT of the dual gate structure are described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> shows a sectional structure of a TFT of the bottom gate structure, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> shows a sectional structure of a TFT of the top gate structure, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> shows a sectional structure of a TFT of the dual gate structure. </paragraph>
