<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to turbine equipment having a compressor, a combustor, and a turbine. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Various ideas have been incorporated into turbine power generation equipment (turbine equipment) having a compressor, a combustor and a turbine in order to increase an electrical efficiency and a thermal efficiency. Of them, the idea of bleeding air from the compressor, and introducing it into the turbine to cool turbine blades has been put into practice. Cooling of the stationary blades of the turbine is performed by bleeding compressed air having a pressure corresponding to a stationary blade stage from the compressor, and introducing it into the site of a predetermined stage of the turbine. Cooling of rotor blades of the turbine is performed by introducing part of discharge air from the compressor into the turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventional turbine equipment consumed a large amount of compressed air, because much air is required for cooling of the blades. Blade cooling air has a very low rate of conversion into output by turbine stages, and has decreased the rate of conversion into turbine output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been accomplished in view of the above circumstances, and its object is to provide turbine equipment capable of sufficiently cooling turbine blades while saving compressed air. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The turbine equipment of the present invention comprises a gas turbine having an introduction passage for introducing air, which has been bled from a compressor, for cooling blades of the turbine, characterized in that a cooler for precooling bled air for blade cooling is provided in the introduction passage in the gas turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to this feature, air for blade cooling can be cooled by the cooler and introduced into the turbine, so that the temperature of air introduced to the blades of the turbine can be lowered. Since compressed air for blade cooling is decreased, air for turbine actuation is increased. Thus, compression power can be effectively converted into turbine output, and power generation output increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the turbine equipment of the present invention, moreover, an air recovery blade is provided in a turbine, and air recovery intercooling can be performed simultaneously. The resulting cold water is used to cool intake air for a low pressure compressor. Thus, power generation output and electrical efficiency can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, fuel is used as a cold heat source for the cooler. Thus, cooling of compressed air can be carried out using a very simple configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Besides, the cooler is a fuel reformer. Thus, the increased calories of fuel can be made equal to or higher than mere sensible heat recovered, and reduction of fuel consumption can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In addition, a fuel cell, which is supplied with reformed fuel from the fuel reformer, is provided. Thus, it becomes possible to realize high efficiency gas turbine equipment topped with the high efficiency power generation of the fuel cell.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Turbine equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment is described based on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the turbine equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a combustor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a generator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is coaxially connected to the compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Compressed air, compressed by and discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is charged into the combustor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> together with fuel f, and a combustion gas from the combustor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is expanded by the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Part of compressed air discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is cooled by a cooler <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and merged with a working fluid for the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in order to cool rotor blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The turbine equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a plurality of (two in the illustrated embodiment) introduction passages <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for introducing air, which has been bled from the compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for the purpose of cooling the blades (stationary blades) of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and each introduction passage <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is equipped with a cooler <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Air bled from the compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is cooled by the cooler <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and introduced into the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. An introduction passage <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is provided for introducing part of compressed air, which has been discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for the purpose of cooling the stationary blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the introduction passage <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is equipped with a cooler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the above-described turbine equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, part of compressed air discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is cooled by the cooler <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and merged with the working fluid for the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to cool the rotor blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Further, air from the compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is bled through the introduction passages <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the bled air is cooled by the coolers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and introduced to the stationary blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The stationary blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are cooled with air cooled by the coolers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Also, part of compressed air discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is introduced into the introduction passage <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and cooled by the cooler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to cool the stationary blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Thus, air for blade cooling is cooled by the coolers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so that the temperature of air introduced to the stationary blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be lowered. Hence, a sufficient cooling effect is obtained by a small amount of air, and the amount of compressed air bled through the introduction passages <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be decreased. As a result, air charged into the combustor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (and turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) can be increased in amount, thus making it possible to convert the compression power into turbine output effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Turbine equipment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment is described based on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The same constituent elements as in the turbine equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are assigned the same numerals, and duplicate explanations are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the turbine equipment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has an air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provided in a turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and an introduction passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided for guiding air, which has been recovered from the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to stationary blades on a low pressure side of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The introduction passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is equipped with a cooler <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and air, which has been recovered from the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is cooled by the cooler <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and introduced to the stationary blades on the low pressure side of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. An introduction passage <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is merged into the introduction passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on a downstream side of the cooler <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the above-described turbine equipment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, part of compressed air discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is introduced into the introduction passage <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and cooled by a cooler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to cool the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Further, air recovered from the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is cooled by the cooler <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and introduced to the stationary blades on the low pressure side of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to cool the stationary blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Thus, air for cooling is cooled by the cooler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the cooler <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, so that the temperature of air introduced to the stationary blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be lowered. Hence, a sufficient cooling effect is obtained by a small amount of air, and the amount of compressed air bled through an introduction passage <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be decreased. Accordingly, the amount of air charged into a combustor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be increased, thus making it possible to convert the compression power into turbine output effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Turbine equipment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment is described based on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The same constituent elements as in the turbine equipment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are assigned the same numerals, and duplicate explanations are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the turbine equipment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> further has a compressor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a combustor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a turbine <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> on a high pressure side. The high pressure side turbine <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is provided with an air recovery blade <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and air discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and cooled by a cooler <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is introduced to the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. An introduction passage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided for guiding air, which has been recovered from the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to an air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on a low pressure side. The introduction passage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is equipped with a cooler <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Air, which has passed through the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is cooled by the cooler <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and introduced to the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. An exhaust gas incorporation passage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is provided for incorporating air, which has passed through the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, into an exhaust gas from the turbine <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> on the high pressure side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is permissible to guide air from the introduction passage <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to a working fluid for the low pressure side turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (incorporation passage a), rather than to the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The air recovered from the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be fed to and used for other instrument system b, without being incorporated into the exhaust gas from the high pressure side turbine <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The embodiment shown is an embodiment in which the low pressure side compressor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, combustor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the high pressure side compressor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, combustor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and turbine <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are provided in series. However, like turbine equipment <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> according to the fourth embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> compressor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a combustor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a turbine <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on an intermediate pressure side can be further provided in series, an air recovery blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be provided in the turbine <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and an introduction passage <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, an exhaust gas incorporation passage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a cooler <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can be provided. In this case, an exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust gas incorporation passage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is incorporated into the exhaust gas side of the high pressure side turbine <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (indicated by a solid line in the drawing). The air flowing through the exhaust gas incorporation passage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, may be incorporated into the exhaust gas side of the turbine <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (indicated by a dotted line in the drawing), or into the exhaust gas side of the intermediate pressure side turbine <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (indicated by a solid line in the drawing). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the above-described turbine equipment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, air recovered from the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is cooled by the cooler <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and introduced to the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Further, air recovered from the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is incorporated into the exhaust gas from the high pressure side turbine <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Thus, air for cooling is cooled by the cooler <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the cooler <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so that common air is introduced to the stationary blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the turbine <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Hence, the amounts of air charged into the combustors and the turbines increase, thus making it possible to convert the compression power into turbine output effectively. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Intake air cooled by a cooler <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is introduced into the compressor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, where it is compressed. An absorption refrigerating machine <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which is actuated by recovered heat from a cooler <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, is provided. Compressed air, which has been compressed by and discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, is charged into the intake air cooler <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and a cooler <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for cooling, and is then compressed by the high pressure side compressor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The intake air cooler <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> feeds a working fluid (e.g., hot water, steam) for the absorption refrigerating machine <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>.

The turbine <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is provided with an air recovery blade <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and an introduction passage <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is provided for guiding air, which has been recovered from the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, to the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the turbine <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The introduction passage <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is equipped with a cooler <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, where air for blade cooling is cooled with cold water from the absorption refrigerating machine <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. An exhaust gas incorporation passage <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is provided for incorporating air, which has been recovered from the air recovery blade <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, into an exhaust gas from the turbine <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the above-described turbine equipment <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the set of the compressor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, combustor <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and turbine <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and the set of the compressor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, combustor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and turbine <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are disposed in parallel. The cooler <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the intake air cooler <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are provided on the entrance side of the compressor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the compressor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. By this arrangement, intake air for the compressor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and intake air for the compressor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are cooled to increase the efficiency. Moreover, air for cooling the turbine <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the turbine <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is cooled by the coolers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, so that the temperature of air introduced to the stationary blades of the turbine <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the turbine <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is lowered. Because of this drop in temperature, a sufficient cooling effect is obtained by a small amount of air. Thus, the amounts of air fed from the combustor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the turbine <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and air fed from the combustor <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to the turbine <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, as well as the amount of exhaust gases, can be increased. Hence, it becomes possible to increase fluids which are converted into turbine output effectively. Furthermore, the absorption refrigerating machine <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is actuated by recovered heat from the intake air cooler <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Thus, in addition to heat recovery, the intake air cooler <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the coolers <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> perform air cooling with cold water from the absorption refrigerating machine <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In this case, the exhaust gas from the exhaust gas incorporation passage <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is incorporated into both of (or one of) the exhaust gas side of the intermediate pressure side turbine <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (indicated by a solid line in the drawing) and the exhaust gas side of the high pressure side turbine <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (indicated by a dotted line in the drawing). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Since compressed air compressed by the compressor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has a high temperature, it is charged into the compressor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, after its temperature is lowered by heat exchange with fuel f in a fuel heater <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This manner corresponds to the use of fuel f as a cold heat source for the cooler (FIG. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, numeral <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>). Compressed air, which has been compressed by and discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, is charged into the combustor <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, together with fuel f heated by the fuel heater <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A combustion gas from the combustor <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is expanded by the turbine <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>.

Thus, cooling of intake air can be carried out by a very simple configuration, and compression power can be decreased. Furthermore, recovered heat is converted into the potential heat of fuel, so that a fuel saving results in a high electrical efficiency. </paragraph>
