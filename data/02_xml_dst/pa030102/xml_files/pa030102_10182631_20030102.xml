<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hydrostatic gas bearing for use in a vacuum, a hydrostatic gas bearing device incorporating the hydrostatic gas bearing, and a gas recovering method for the hydrostatic gas bearing device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, in a hydrostatic gas bearing for use in a vacuum, as a shape accuracy required for a moving body and a fixed body surface opposed to the moving body, only flatness to an extent of not affecting the size of a floating gap and a labyrinth seal gap has been required, and pores in the surface have especially not been considered. Also, in selecting the material of a guide shaft of the fixed body and the material of the moving body, only a property that the quantity of gas being discharged when the material is continuously exposed to a vacuum environment for a fixed period of time or more is small has been considered not to exert an influence on the reached degree of vacuum of mounted equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Also, a general hydrostatic gas bearing is configured so that a high-pressure gas is released from an air pad provided on the moving body into a gap between the moving body and the fixed body surface, and the moving body and the fixed body are made in a non-contact state by the hydrostatic pressure of released gas, by which the moving body is moved with frictional resistance being scarcely encountered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the hydrostatic gas bearing as described above, in order to maintain the vacuum environment, it is desirable that an atmospheric pressure groove is provided around the air pad, and a mechanism for keeping the gas pressure in the atmospheric pressure groove at the atmospheric pressure be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The reason for this is that by providing the atmospheric pressure groove around the air pad, even in the design of hydrostatic gas bearing for vacuum, the load capacity, rigidity, and the like of the air pad can be designed by the same design technique as that for the ordinary hydrostatic gas bearing for use in an atmospheric environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Also, when the atmospheric pressure groove is not provided, all gas emitted from the air pad flows into an exhaust pump through a pressure reducing groove, so that the load of the exhaust pump increases undesirably. To prevent this phenomenon, the provision of the atmospheric pressure groove is also effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as a mechanism for keeping the pressure in the atmospheric pressure groove at the atmospheric pressure, conventionally, an atmospheric pressure pipe has been connected to the atmospheric pressure groove provided around the air pad, and the other end of the atmospheric pressure pipe has simply been opened to the atmosphere on the outside of a vacuum chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For the hydrostatic gas bearing manufactured by using the prior art, even when the quantity of gas discharged from a bearing device is lower than the specified discharge quantity in a stationary state, the quantity of gas discharged from the bearing device increases suddenly at the same time that the moving body starts to move, so that the reached pressure in the vacuum chamber is sometimes deteriorated remarkably. The reason for this is as described below. For example, in the hydrostatic gas bearing provided with the air pad on the moving body side, a portion covered by the moving body of the fixed body surface is exposed to a high-pressure floatation gas in a stationary state, and thus large quantities of gas molecules adhere to that portion. Subsequently, when the moving body moves and the surface thereof is exposed to the vacuum environment, large quantities of gas molecules adhering to the surface of guide shaft are discharged to the outside, which is resultantly detected as a sudden increase in the quantity of gas being discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When the above-mentioned pressure increase occurs in a hydrostatic gas bearing mounted, for example, in an EB exposure system, a sudden increase in pressure degrades the accuracy of exposure pattern, and sometimes damages the electron beam source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A hydrostatic gas bearing constructed so that the air pad is provided on the fixed body side also presents the same problem at the time of movement because gas molecules adhere to the surface of the moving body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The inventor started research and development of a hydrostatic gas bearing capable of being used in an environment of higher vacuum (about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>Pa). As the result, it was verified that there occurs, on rare occasions, a phenomenon that the gas pressure in the vacuum chamber increases due to the movement of the moving body even from a cause other than the gas supplied to the air pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, in order to determine the cause and to provide a higher-performance hydrostatic gas bearing, the inventor further conducted research and development earnestly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case of a semiconductor exposure system, the vacuum chamber in which a hydrostatic gas bearing is mounted is usually placed in a clean room whose temperature and humidity are controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the hydrostatic gas bearing in which the atmospheric pressure groove in the bearing is simply opened to the atmosphere on the outside of vacuum chamber via the atmospheric pressure pipe, gas usually flows out from the bearing side to the atmosphere side. However, it was found that gas may sometimes flow in inversely from the atmosphere side to the bearing side depending on the pressure balance of the atmospheric pressure groove fluctuated by the bearing gap etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When gas flows inversely from the atmosphere side to the bearing side as described above, the atmosphere having a specific humidity flows in to the bearing side via the atmospheric pressure groove, and thus large amounts of water molecules undesirably adsorb on the surface of the guide shaft. If the moving body of the bearing starts to move in this state and the guide shaft surface on which water molecules have adsorbed is exposed to a vacuum, the adsorbing water molecules are released into the vacuum environment, which results in an increase in gas pressure in the vacuum chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Even if the quantity of adsorbing water molecules is minute, when the pressure in the vacuum chamber is a high vacuum of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>Pa, a remarkable increase in pressure is observed. If such an increase in pressure occurs in the bearing, for example, in an electron beam exposure system, the above-mentioned phenomenon may cause a failure of light source and degradation of exposure accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the hydrostatic gas bearing for use in an environment of an especially high vacuum, it is necessary to carry out control so that the causes for the increase in gas pressure in the vacuum chamber are obviated. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made to solve the above problems, and accordingly a first object thereof is to provide a hydrostatic gas bearing in which an increase in the quantity of gas being discharged during the movement of a moving body is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above first object, the present invention provides a hydrostatic gas bearing for use in a vacuum, which is formed of a moving body and a fixed body opposed to the moving body, characterized in that the surface of a guide shaft of the fixed body and/or the surface of the moving body are subjected to processing for reducing adhesion of gas molecules. Since surface treatment for decreasing the quantity of adhering gas is done on the surface of the guide shaft of the fixed body, the increase in the quantity of gas being discharged during the movement of the moving body is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The degree of vacuum in a vacuum chamber is required to be 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Pa or lower depending on the service conditions. Further, movement in a vacuum environment of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>Pa or lower is also expected in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this description, to decrease the quantity of adhering gas molecules means to decrease the quantity of adhering gas molecule so that gas molecules do not adhere to the guide shaft etc. to an extent that the pressure is not increased to an extent that even if adhering gas molecules are released in a vacuum, they do not hinder the use of device in the above-mentioned vacuum environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> For example, conventionally, on the surface of the guide shaft newly exposed by the movement of moving body, gas molecules of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>mole per 1 m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>adhere at the moment of exposure. These gas molecules are released in the vacuum, exerting an adverse influence on the use of hydrostatic gas bearing in a vacuum environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the hydrostatic gas bearing in accordance with the present invention, the quantity of adhering gas molecules can be decreased to about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>mole per 1 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, so that the use of hydrostatic gas bearing in a vacuum environment is not hindered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the subjects to be subjected to the above-mentioned surface treatment are not limited to the surface of the fixed body. The effect of surface treatment can be achieved by subjecting a member exposed to the vacuum environment by the movement, of the bearing constituting members, to treatment immediately after the member is exposed to a high-pressure floatation gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Also, as the surface treatment for decreasing the quantity of adhering gas, the surface of the guide shaft of fixed body and/or the surface of the moving body is coated with a material having a lower adhesion probability of gas. By this method, the adhesion probability of gas on the bearing surface is decreased. Also, pores in a ceramics surface are filled with the coating and thus a smooth surface is formed, so that the quantity of adhering gas molecules is further decreased. For example, by coating an Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>surface with TiC by CVD, the quantity of adhering H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, which especially poses a problem of adhesion of gas molecules, can be kept about two orders of magnitude smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Also, since the film of TiC has electric conductivity, for the hydrostatic gas bearing mounted in an EB exposure system, an antistatic effect due to electron can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As a preferred mode of the present invention, the guide shaft of fixed body and/or the moving body formed of high-density ceramics having few pores in the surface thereof is manufactured, by which an increase in the quantity of gas being discharged caused by the influence of the above-mentioned pores is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Usually, since an infinite number of pores exist in the surface of ceramics, when the surface is exposed to a high-pressure gas, the pores are filled with the gas. Therefore, when the moving body moves and the surface thereof is exposed to a vacuum, the gas filled in the pores is slowly released into the vacuum chamber, so that the reached degree of vacuum of the vacuum chamber is deteriorated. Also, when the ceramics are machined, dirt such as a grinding fluid is liable to remain in the pores, and much gas adheres to the dirt, so that the dirt sometimes becomes a serious gas release source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Ceramics having few pores can be obtained by a method in which ceramics are manufactured using fine-grain raw material powder having an average grain size of 1 &mgr;m or smaller, a method in which ceramics are subjected to hot press processing before firing to densify them, a method in which the ordinary alumina ceramics are subjected to HIP processing, or the like method. It is desirable that the theoretical density of pore area in the ceramics surface be 1% or lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Also, as a floatation gas for hydrostatic gas bearing suitable to the present invention, an inert gas such as argon, which has less interaction with a solid and less adhesion to the surface, is used to decrease the quantity of gas being discharged at the time of movement. When argon is used, since the gas molecular weight is higher than that of the ordinary gas (N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), the conductance of a labyrinth seal becomes low, which achieves an effect of obtaining high sealing performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Also, a second object of the present invention is to provide a hydrostatic gas bearing device for use in a vacuum environment, in which in a device incorporating a hydrostatic gas bearing for use in a vacuum environment, the pressure in an atmospheric pressure groove within the bearing in a vacuum environment is kept fixed, and the inflow of impurities such as water content of gas caused by the backward flow of outside gas into the atmospheric pressure groove through a pipe for atmospheric pressure groove is prevented, by which a decrease in the degree of vacuum in the vacuum environment can be prevented, and a gas recovering method for the hydrostatic gas bearing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> To achieve the second object, the present invention provides a hydrostatic gas bearing device for use in a vacuum environment, in which a guide shaft and moving body moving along the guide shaft are provided in a vacuum chamber; the moving body is formed with an air pad for releasing gas fed from the outside into a gap between the moving body and the guide shaft; an atmospheric pressure groove, which recovers the gas released into the gap and discharges the recovered gas to the outside through a pipe, is provided around the air pad; and a pressure reducing groove, which recovers the gas having not been recovered by the atmospheric pressure groove and discharges the recovered gas to the outside through a pipe, is provided around the atmospheric pressure groove, characterized in that in a pipe for discharging the gas recovered through the atmospheric pressure groove to the outside, there is provided a pressure buffering chamber, in which the internal gas pressure thereof is a fixed pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure so that gas does not flow backward from the outside to the atmospheric pressure groove through the pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thereby, the inflow of impurities such as water content of gas caused by the backward flow of outside gas into the atmospheric pressure groove within the bearing through the pipe is inhibited, by which a decrease in the degree of vacuum in the vacuum environment can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In particular, in the hydrostatic gas bearing for use in a high vacuum environment, the present invention achieves great effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Also, it is preferable that the pressure buffering chamber be provided with a gas recovery port connected with a pipe for recovering gas from the atmospheric pressure groove; a gas feed port connected with a pipe for feeding gas by controlling the quantity of gas being fed so that the gas pressure in the pressure buffering chamber is a fixed pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure; and a gas leak port connected with a pipe for always discharging the gas in the pressure buffering chamber to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Thereby, since gas is always discharged to the outside through the gas leak port of the pressure buffering chamber, the inflow of impurities from the outside into the pressure buffering chamber can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> That is to say, impurities coming from the outside can be prevented from flowing into the atmospheric pressure groove, so that a decrease in the degree of vacuum of the vacuum environment can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Also, as a gas fed into the pressure buffering chamber, high-purity nitrogen or dry air is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Thus, even if gas flows into the atmospheric pressure groove through the pressure buffering chamber, gas in the air containing much water does not flow in, and high-purity nitrogen flows into the pressure buffering chamber, so that there is no fear of degraded vacuum environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Also, in a gas recovering method for the hydrostatic gas bearing device, the gas pressure in a pressure buffering chamber provided on the outside of the hydrostatic gas bearing device is controlled so as to be a fixed pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure to always discharge gas from the pressure buffering chamber to the outside, and the gas recovered through the atmospheric pressure groove is also discharged to the outside through the pressure buffering chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thereby, since gas is always discharged to the outside through the gas leak port of the pressure buffering chamber, the inflow of impurities from the outside to the pressure buffering chamber can be prevented, and the gas released from the air pad can be recovered through the atmospheric pressure groove in the bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> That is to say, when the gas released from the air pad is recovered through the atmospheric pressure groove in the bearing, impurities coming from the outside can be prevented from flowing into the atmospheric pressure groove, so that a decrease in the degree of vacuum of the vacuum environment can be prevented.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing one embodiment of a hydrostatic bearing in accordance with the present invention, which view shows an example in which a coating <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is applied to the surface of the guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The coating <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was applied to the outer periphery of the guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>using a material having a low gas adhesion probability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Hereunder, the improvement in performance achieved by the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A conventional hydrostatic gas bearing was placed in a vacuum chamber of about 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Pa, and a change in the degree of vacuum in the vacuum chamber at the time when air is used as the floatation gas was shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The ordinates represent the pressures in the vacuum chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The abscissas represent times. First, recording was started in a state in which the bearing moving body stands still. After two seconds have elapsed, the movement of moving body was started (speed: 55 m/s), and then the moving body was stopped after the movement has been continued for about four seconds. The recording was finished 20 seconds after the measurement start (about 14 seconds after the stopping of moving body). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the conventional hydrostatic gas bearing was used, the chamber pressure began to increase simultaneously with the movement start and reached about 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>Pa. The chamber pressure did not return to the original pressure even 20 seconds after the measurement start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The reason for this is that gas molecules adhere to the guide shaft, and the guide shaft is exposed in the vacuum chamber by the movement of moving body, so that the adhering gas molecules are released into the vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When the movement speed is further increased, the pressure in the vacuum chamber increases in proportion to the speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Next, a result of measurement made by using a hydrostatic gas bearing according to claim 4 was shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The surface of fixed body was coated with TiC, and measurement was made under the same conditions as those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As the result, the increase in chamber pressure caused by movement reduced to an extent of not being detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The coating material is not limited to TiC. SiC may be used, or a metal such as aluminum may be deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Contrarily, a result of measurement made by using a hydrostatic gas bearing according to claim 5 was shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. As a material for fixed body, HIP processed alumina ceramics having a limited number of pores were used, and measurement was made under the same conditions as those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As the result, the increase in chamber pressure reduced to about one-tenth of the conventional bearing (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, since an air pad is provided on the moving body side, the surface treatment is done only on the surface of guide shaft. However, in the hydrostatic gas bearing having a construction in which the air pad is provided on the fixed body side, surface treatment on the surface of moving body is effective. Further, the surface treatment is not limited to either one of the guide shaft and the moving body, and can be done on both of the guide shaft and the moving body. As a concrete method for coating the ceramics surface with TiC, for example, a technique called plasma CVD, in which in a state in which ceramics are heated to 900&deg; C., a mixture gas of TiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and CH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is made in a plasma state around the ceramics, by which TiC film is formed on the ceramics surface, can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Also, as a concrete method for manufacturing ceramics having few pores by HIP, for example, a method in which fired alumina ceramics are held for 10 hours in argon gas having a high temperature of 1650&deg; C. and a high pressure of 100 MPa is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Next, a hydrostatic gas bearing device A for achieving the second object of the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> This hydrostatic gas bearing device A has a surface plate B and a hydrostatic gas bearing D provided in a vacuum chamber C. The pressure of vacuum environment in the vacuum chamber C in which the hydrostatic gas bearing D moves is required to be 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Pa or lower. Further, movement in a vacuum environment of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>Pa or lower is also expected in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The hydrostatic gas bearing D is formed of a moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (fixed body). As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed with air pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for releasing a gas supplied from the outside into a gap between the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Further, around the air pad <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, there is provided an atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for recovering the gas released into the gap and discharging it to the outside via a pipe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for atmospheric pressure groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Also, around the atmospheric pressure grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, there is provided pressure reducing groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for recovering the gas having not been recovered by the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and discharging it to the outside via a pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Although the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the pressure reducing groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are provided in the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the pipe for pressure reducing groove is also provided on the guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, exhaust connecting groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>communicating with the pressure reducing groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed in the vertical direction in the figure. The guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed with an exhaust hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for recovering gas through the pressure reducing groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (including the exhaust connecting groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) at a position opposed to the vertical exhaust connecting groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Therefore, even if the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> moves in the range from a position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(B) to a position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(C), the exhaust hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> communicates with the exhaust connecting groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, so that gas in the pressure reducing groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (including the exhaust connecting groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) can be exhausted through the exhaust hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> By the above-described configuration, by using the atmospheric pressure grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> surrounding the air pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the hydrostatic gas bearing D, and further by using a labyrinth exhaust mechanism surrounding the atmospheric pressure grooves <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the quantity of gas flowing out into the vacuum chamber C is kept small to an extent of having no influence on the degree of vacuum of the vacuum chamber C. A plurality of pressure reducing grooves <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be provided according to the required degree of vacuum of operation environment to improve the recovery rate of gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Also, although the case where the pipe for pressure reducing groove is provided within the guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has been shown, the pipe can be provided in the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. For example, in order that the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made smaller in size and the pipe is not restricted by the movement distance of the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the pipe is preferably provided in the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> if the pumping performance is sacrificed to some extent. In this case, the above-mentioned vertical pressure reducing groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> However, since gas is recovered by an evacuator, the diameter of the pipe for pressure reducing groove is, in general, considerably larger than the diameter of the pipe connected to the air pad <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In this case, if the pipe for pressure reducing groove is connected to the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the pipe works as a source of resistance and vibration, which may exert an adverse influence on the high movement accuracy required by the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the pipe for pressure reducing groove should usually be provided on the guide shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In effect, it should be determined whether the pipe for pressure reducing groove is provided in the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or in the guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> considering the size and movement distance of the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the influence exerted on the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as resistance by the pipe in the case where the pipe is connected to the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and other factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> pipe and a feed pump for feeding gas to the air pad <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the pipe for pressure reducing groove, and the evacuator are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, for this hydrostatic bearing device, a pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the outside of the vacuum chamber C is connected to a pipe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for atmospheric pressure groove for discharging the gas recovered through the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the outside to prevent gas from flowing backward from the outside to the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through the pipe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for atmospheric pressure groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with a gas recovery port <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a gas feed port <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a gas leak port <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The gas recovery port <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected with the pipe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for atmospheric pressure groove for recovering gas from the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through an introduction port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the vacuum chamber C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Also, the gas feed port <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected with a gas feed pipe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for feeding gas by controlling the quantity of gas being fed so that the gas pressure in the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a higher than the atmospheric pressure. A pressure gage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided to measure the internal pressure of the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and also a mass-flow controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is connected in the gas feed pipe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A signal is sent from the pressure gage <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the mass-flow controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> via a signal cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the pressure in the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is about 10% higher than the atmospheric pressure to control the flow rate of gas being fed. Thereby, the flow rate of nitrogen flowing from a nitrogen cylinder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the gas feed pipe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Also, the gas leak port <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected with a pipe for always discharging the gas in the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the outside. It is preferable that a leak valve <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> provided in the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> be throttled properly to regulate the flow rate of nitrogen flowing out from the leak valve <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to the outside so as to be about 5 to 10 liters/minute. Thereby, the quantity of nitrogen being consumed can be kept small while the air is prevented from flowing from the leak valve <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> into the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The nitrogen supplied from the nitrogen cylinder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is preferably of high purity to prevent the degree of vacuum around the bearing from decreasing even if the gas in the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> flows backward to the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The purity of the high-purity nitrogen is preferably 99.99% or higher. Especially when the hydrostatic gas bearing is used in a high vacuum of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>Pa, the purity of nitrogen is preferably 99.9999% or higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Also, the gas fed into the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the gas feed pipe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be dry air. In this case, the dry air preferably has a dew point of &minus;30&deg; C. or lower so that the degree of vacuum does not decrease even if the gas in the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> flows backward to the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Next, a gas recovering method for a hydrostatic gas bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for use in the above-described vacuum environment will be described in due succession. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> First, a high-pressure gas is released from the air pad <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> provided on the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the gap between the guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are made in a non-contact state by the static force of the released gas, so that the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can move along the guide shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with frictional resistance being scarcely encountered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Next, the gas released into the above-mentioned gap is recovered through the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provided around the air pad <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> At this time, the gas pressure in the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided on the outside of the hydrostatic gas bearing device A is controlled so as to be a fixed pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure (for example, a pressure 10% higher than the atmospheric pressure), by which gas is always discharged from the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the outside, and also the gas recovered through the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is also discharged to the outside through the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the outside air is prevented from flowing backward into the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to decrease the gas released in the vacuum from the end of the moving body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the gas that has not been recovered through the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is recovered through the pressure reducing groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> provided around the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In the above-described process, the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> communicates with the air only through the leak valve <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> provided in the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Since nitrogen of about 5 to 10 liters/minute flows out through the leak valve <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the inflow of impurities from the air can be restrained. Thereupon, the gas flowing into the atmospheric pressure groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is only the gas flowing in through the air pad <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or the nitrogen supplied from the nitrogen cylinder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through the pressure buffering chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so that a trouble such as an increase in the quantity of gas being discharged from the bearing caused by the inflow of impurities can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the present invention, since surface treatment is done on the surface of the guide shaft of fixed body and/or the surface of the moving body to decrease the quantity of adhering gas, there can be provided a hydrostatic gas bearing capable of restraining the increase in the quantity of gas being discharged at the time of movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Also, the surface of the guide shaft of fixed body and/or the surface of the moving body is coated with a material having a lower gas adhesion probability, especially, coating is performed on an Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>surface by physically depositing TiC having electric conductivity. Therefore, there can be provided a hydrostatic gas bearing capable of keeping the quantity of adhering H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, which especially poses a problem of adhesion of gas molecules, about two orders of magnitude smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Also, the guide shaft of fixed body and/or the moving body is manufactured of high-density ceramics having few pores in the surface thereof. Therefore, there can be provided a hydrostatic gas bearing capable of reducing the increase in the quantity of gas being discharged caused by the influence of pores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Also, as a floatation gas of hydrostatic gas bearing, an inert gas such as argon, which has less interaction with a solid and less adhesion to the surface, is used. Therefore, there can be provided a hydrostatic gas bearing capable of decreasing the quantity of gas being discharged at the time of movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the hydrostatic gas bearing device in accordance with the present invention, the pressure in the atmospheric pressure groove in the bearing in a vacuum environment is kept fixed, and the inflow of impurities such as water content of gas caused by the backward flow of outside gas into the atmospheric pressure groove through the pipe for atmospheric pressure groove is inhibited, by which a decrease in the degree of vacuum in the vacuum environment can be prevented. </paragraph>
