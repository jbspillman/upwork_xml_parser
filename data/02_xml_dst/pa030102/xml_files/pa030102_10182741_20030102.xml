<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention provides an apparatus for turning pages of a music book. When a music performer manipulates a power switch, an actuating lever disposed in a housing of the apparatus is raised out of a guide groove of the housing and presses down and carries a right lower end of the page in accordance with an operation of a driving motor interlocked with the actuating lever. At this time, a pressure contact piece is moved in a fore and aft direction with respect to the page to press down or to be separated from the page so that the page can be smoothly turned. The actuating lever continues to pivot leftward along the guide groove to completely turn the page. After completing the operation of turning the page, the actuating lever is separated from the turned page and returns to an initial position along the guide groove. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus for turning pages of books, particularly a music book, which is used when a music performer plays a musical instrument. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus for turning pages of a music book which is improved over a conventional apparatus disclosed in the applicant&apos;s Korean Patent Application No. 1998-41445 and in which a pressing piece disposed at a top end of an actuating lever of the apparatus turns pages of a music book while the actuating lever pivots on a hinge leftward when a music performer hits a power switch with his/her foot. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The conventional apparatus disclosed in the aforementioned Korean patent application turns a page of a music book in such a manner that when a music performer manipulates an operation button <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with his/her foot, an actuating lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is raised upwardly from a support <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> along a guide groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by driving force of a motor installed within the support <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and then pivots along the guide groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a state where a roller <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> fixed to a leading end of the actuating lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> presses down the page of the book, as schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional apparatus has the following disadvantages in view of its operation due to structural defects. In case of a bulky book, when the actuating lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> pivots to turn a page of the book, a supporting rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not timely separated from the page, and thus, the turned page is crumpled or torn. On the contrary, in case of a thin book, when the actuating lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> pivots, the supporting rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is separated from the page of the book too early, and thus, one or more pages are turned together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Further, since the actuating lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> takes the shape of a strip, a central portion of the page bulges toward the guide groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and comes into contact with an inner surface of the actuating lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the actuating lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> pivots along the guide groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Thus, there is a problem in that since the roller <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> for pressing down the page is spaced apart from the page, the page cannot be smoothly turned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the supporting rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> protrudes upwardly too much from a top surface of the support <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it is inconvenient to carry or store the apparatus. In addition, since the width of a trajectory of the actuating lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> becomes inherently large in view of its structure, the width of the guide groove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes also large. Therefore, there is another operational problem in that the page of the book is caught in the guide groove. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention is conceived to solve the problems as mentioned above. An object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for turning pages of a book, wherein whenever a user manipulates a power switch to supply electric power to a motor, an actuating lever presses down and carries the page of the book to correctly turn pages of the book while pivoting along a guide groove and then returns to an initial position, so that the user can concentrate his/her attention on his/her performance of a music instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for turning pages of a book, wherein when an actuating lever turns the page of the book and then returns to the initial position, the actuating lever can be prevented from interfering with adjacent components densely disposed in a narrow space within a body of the apparatus and thus can be smoothly operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for turning pages of a book, wherein the width of a groove for guiding of an actuating lever is minimized to prevent the page from being caught in the guide groove and foreign materials such as dust from being introduced into the guide groove, and flexibility in a product design can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for turning pages of a music book, wherein a pressing piece of an actuating lever for contacting and carrying a central lower portion of the page of the book is properly controlled in view of its contacting/separating direction and contact time so as to prevent the pressing piece from slipping on the page of the book and the page from being turned back due to contact with the pressing piece when the actuating lever returns an initial position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above objects, an apparatus for turning pages of a book includes a housing in which a geared motor rotatable in forward and reverse directions and associated with an actuating lever driven when a user applies electric power thereto is installed and a backing plate for supporting the book thereon is formed; and a cover of the housing provided with a guide groove for guiding the actuating lever and with a supporting piece for fixing the page of the book which has been turned. The apparatus further comprises a rotational-direction changing unit having a guider formed on a side of a reduction gear for finally reducing a rotational speed of the geared motor; a pivoting unit having the actuating lever of which a lower end is hingedly secured on a pivoting shaft and the other upper end is formed with a pressing piece fixed thereto and which extends through a guide slot; a pressing/restraining unit having a helical depressing piece which surrounds the other upper end of the actuating lever and of which a lower end is fixed through a pin to a fixing member that is fixed through a pin to the body, and elastic members connected to the fixing member and a lower end of the depressing piece, respectively; and a contacting/releasing unit having a stopper interlocked with a crankshaft, and a pressure contact member connected through a wire and an elastic member to the stopper and connected to an elastic member so that the pressure contact member can pivot in a fore and aft direction.</paragraph>

The reference numeral <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> designates a guide member with a forward slant surface for ensuring that the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is safely and correctly seated upon its return to the initial position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the operation of the apparatus for pages of a book according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in a state where a book <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> (e.g., a music book) is placed on the cover <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> detachably secured on the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, when the music performer manipulates the power switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> with his/her foot, the geared motor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> installed within the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is supplied with the electric power and then is driven in the forward direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When the geared motor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is driven, the guider <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> formed on the side of the reduction gear <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is rotated in the forward direction with the rotational speed thereof reduced through the intermediate and reduction gears <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Thus, the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of which the lower end is hingedly fixed to the pivoting shaft <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and which extends through the guide slot <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is interlocked with the guider <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and pivots on the hinge pin of the pivoting shaft <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> At the same time, the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> escapes from the U-shaped slit of the guide piece <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and is raised out of the guide groove <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> formed in the cover <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, and the pressing piece <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> fixed to the upper end of the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is moved to the right lower end portion of the page of the book <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> At this time, the helical depressing piece <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> capable of performing a three-dimensional movement, which is secured to the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> so as to be pivotable in both the left and right direction and the up and down direction, is pivoted while causing the pressing piece <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> of the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to be pulled toward and in close contact with the right lower portion of the page by means of the tension of the elastic members <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Thus, the pressing piece <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> of the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can push and raise bulgingly the page of the book without slippage thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> That is, due to the tension of the elastic member <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of which the one end is secured to an upper plate of the fixing member <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> vertically pivotably connected through the pin <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to the supporting portion formed on the floor of the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the tension of the elastic member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of which the one end is secured to the left lower end of the depressing piece <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> capable of pivoting on the pin <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the depressing piece <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is pulled downwardly and rearwardly from the front of the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Thus, upon initial operation of the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the depressing piece <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is caused to be moved to and brought into close contact with the right lower end portion of the page of the book <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> along the helical shape of the depressing piece <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> At this time, since the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is moved along the elongated guide slot <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> formed at a predetermined angle in the guider <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> toward a rear end <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the guide slot <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be smoothly moved toward the right lower end portion of the page of the book <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the pressure contact piece <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> of the pressure contact member <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is moved rearwardly and then presses down the central lower portion of the page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(see FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). The pivoting of the pressing piece <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in close contact with the page causes the right lower end of the page to bulge from the central lower portion of the page, so that the page can be easily turned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The rearward movement of the pressure contact piece <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is achieved in such a manner that the crankshaft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is rotated counterclockwise from the right side of the second hook piece <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> to move the stopper <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> leftward against the tension of the elastic member <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> so that the first hook piece <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> of the stopper <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is caught in the fixing piece <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> formed on the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> After the central portion of the page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has bulged, the pressure contact piece <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is moved back toward the front of the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, whereas the pressing piece <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> of the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> pushes the right lower end of a back surface of the page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and simultaneously moves along an arc toward a left upper portion of the book, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The forward movement of the pressure contact piece <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> for the release from the pressure contact state with the page is achieved in such a manner that the crankshaft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is rotated clockwise from the left side of the second hook piece <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> to cause the stopper <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> to be raised in the right direction and thus the first hook piece <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> formed at one end of the stopper <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> to be released from the fixing piece <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> formed on the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and consequently, the stopper <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> connected to the wire <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is moved rightward and the pressure contact member <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is moved toward the front of the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> due to the tension of the elastic member <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Upon initial movement of the pressing piece <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> along the arc, as the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> with the pressing piece <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> thereof positioned at the right lower end of the back surface of the page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is gradually moved toward a top position of the arc, the pressure contact piece <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is moved toward the rear of the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to come into close contact with the next page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the next page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is prevented from following and being turned together with the previous page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Then, the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is moved from the front surface of the page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the back surface thereof to be positioned between the back surface of the page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the next page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>further moved beyond the top position of the arc in the left direction until the movement thereof is completed in close contact with the back surface of the page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. At this time, the page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has been completely turned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The turned page is prevented from returning to the original position since it is caught in the supporting piece <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> formed at a left portion of the cover <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. Further, in the state where the page has been completely turned, the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the first switch <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> so that the relay <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> converts the rotational direction of the geared motor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. At this time, at initial timing of the conversion of the rotational direction, the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is moved to a front end <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the guider slot <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in accordance with the reverse rotation of the guider <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> so that the pressing piece <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> of the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is spaced apart from the turned page. Thus, the pressing piece <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is prevented from catching and returning the turned page <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the original position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, when the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> returns to the initial position by pivoting along the guide groove <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, it comes into contact with the second switch <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to turn off the electric power to the geared motor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In such a way, one cycle of the apparatus is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Additionally, since a central portion of the rod-shaped actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is curved toward the front of the housing <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is prevented from interfering adjacent components while returning to the initial position after turning the page. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Therefore, whenever the user manipulates the power switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> with his/her foot, the geared motor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is driven and the pressure contact member <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the actuating lever <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are repeatedly operated as described above, so that the pages of the book can be turned one by one. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Industrial Applicability </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the following advantages are obtained; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When a music performer manipulates the power switch to supply the electric power to the motor, the actuating lever is driven and pivoted by the motor so that it presses down and carries a page of a book to turn the pages one by one. Thus, the music performer can concentrate his/her attention on his/her performance of a music instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Further, when the actuating lever turns pages of the book and then returns to the initial position, the actuating lever can be prevented from interfering with the adjacent components densely disposed in a narrow space within the housing. The width of the guide groove is minimized to prevent the page of the book from being caught in the guide groove and foreign materials such as dust from being introduced into the guide groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the pressure contact piece for contacting and carrying the central lower portion of the page of the book is properly controlled in view of its contacting/separating direction and contact time so as to prevent the pressing piece from slipping on the page of the book and the page from being turned back by separating the pressing piece from the page when the actuating lever returns to the initial position. </paragraph>
