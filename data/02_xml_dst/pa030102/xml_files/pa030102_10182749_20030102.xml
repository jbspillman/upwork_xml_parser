<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an extraction bag with support, an extraction bag with support containing a material to be extracted and to a sheet composite for producing the bags. More specifically, the invention relates to an extraction bag with support, an extraction bag with support containing a material to be extracted, with which the extraction bag or the extraction bag containing a material to be extracted is stably placed on an extraction container to safely conduct the extraction, and to a sheet composite for easily and efficiently producing the extraction bags with support. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Japanese Examined Utility Model Publication (Kokoku) No. 60-7623 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 8-33572 disclose extraction utensils in which a bag made of a filter and a holder made of a thick paper are combined integrally together, and the holder is folded to assemble a support, thereby to extract a material in the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 11-285443 discloses a simple utensil for extracting beverages such as coffee or the like by perforating a center hole at the center on the center line of a thick sheet, forming pushing lines on the outer sides of the center hole at the center enabling the central portion to be pushed up, forming a pair of support pieces on both outer sides of the center hole so as to meet the center line at right angles and so as to be folded down via the pushing lines, and adhering the top edge of the bag made of a filtering paper to the back side of the whole peripheral edge of the center hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> So far, however, the extraction bags with support have been produced requiring three separate steps, i.e., producing, first, a bag, attaching and fixing the bag to a support, and filling the bag with a material to be extracted. It has therefore been strongly urged to produce a new extraction bag with support that can be produced by continuously conducting the above three steps in the form of a single step. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A step of producing the extraction bag with support of the present invention from the sheet composite of the present invention will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the sheet composite <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is folded into halves along the center line in the lengthwise direction thereof, and the overlapped side edge portions are fed to a bag-making machine (not shown) while being joined together using an adhering machine <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. When a portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A including one support member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the sheet composite <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> folded into halves, has arrived at a position where the bag-making machine produces a bag and where the material to be extracted is filled therein, a gap portion of the overlapped sheet member is adhered like a belt at a portion (gap portion) between the sheet composite portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A and the sheet composite portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B neighboring thereto on the downstream side, and the belt-like adhered portion is cut. Here, a portion close to the edge of the sheet member of the belt-like adhered portion is adhered in a Y-shape and is cut in the Y-shape by using an adhering/cutting machine <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A triangular portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> between the branching two sides may be removed (by, for example, suction) as scrap. When the sheet member contains a synthetic fiber that can be melt-adhered, the adhering/cutting machine <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may have, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an ultrasonic horn (heating member) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an anvil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with a Y-shaped adhering/cutting surface facing thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The ultrasonic sealing machine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> can be used as the adhering machine <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for adhering the overlapped side edge portions of the sheet member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Upon adhering and cutting the gap portion of the sheet member, further, the upper end of the downstream portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B neighboring the sheet composite portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A is, at the same time, adhered and sealed, and is separated as a complete extraction bag with support from the sheet composite portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The material to be extracted can then be filled in the sheet composite portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A of which the lower edge portion and the side edge portions of the sheet member are adhered. In this case, the bag portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A obtained as described above, containing the material to be extracted and having its upper end open, is moved to a downstream position from the position where it is adhered and filled, and has its upper opening portion joined and sealed in the same manner as described above, and is cut and separated away from the upstream sheet composite material neighboring thereto. Thus, there is obtained the extraction bag (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) with support containing the material to be extracted. In the case of the extraction bag (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) with support without containing the material to be extracted, the material to be extracted can be filled after the extraction bag (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the sheet composite of the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the support member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the sheet member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be adhered together on a junction region <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In tearing the support member and the bag member apart along the rows of perforations for cutting or tearing, the portions for cutting or tearing of the support member are not completely removed but instead, some portions of the rows of perforations are left, e.g., either the right end or the left end thereof is left and is folded toward the outside of the opening, while the portions for cutting or tearing of the bag member are completely removed. After the extracting solution (hot water) is poured, the portions for cutting or tearing of the support member are used as a closure to cover the opening, thereby to maintain the temperature and to effect the steaming for the material to be extracted that is heated by the extracting solution (hot water). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The water-permeable filtering sheet forming the bag member of the present invention can be selected from a filtering paper, a filtering cloth and a filtering nonwoven fabric (polyolefin ultrafine fibers such as polyethylene ultrafine fiber and polypropylene ultrafine fiber, polyester ultrafine fiber, and a water-permeable filtering nonwoven fabric produced from mixed fibers of these fibers and a hydrophilic fiber that is usually used for filtering). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, further, the water-resistant sheet forming the support member is selected from sheet materials that are not softened or deformed even when they are brought into contact with the extract at the time of effecting the extraction, and that can be cut or torn by fingers. As such sheet materials, there can be used a paper coated with a water-proof film of a thickness of 30 to 300 &mgr;m, a plastic sheet and a porous polyolefin resin sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> To adhere the bag member and the support member together, it is desired that at least either the bag member or the support member is melt-adhered. An adhesive may be used. Though there is no particular limitation on the kind of the adhesive, it is usually desired to use a water-resistant adhesive and, particularly, to use a harmless water-resistant adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> There is no particular limitation on the material to be extracted that is contained in the extraction bag with support of the present invention provided it can be extracted. For example, there can be contained a coffee powder, green tea, black tea, various kinds of Chinese tea, herb tea as well as various nourishing agents that can be extracted. </paragraph>
