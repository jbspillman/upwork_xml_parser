<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device and a method for continuous pressing of a plastically deformable blank, for example made of a metal, into a three-dimensional section with a predetermined cross-sectional area, comprising a fixed die with an opening formed in the die, through which the plastically deformable blank is intended to be pressed, and at least one rotary die arranged, adjacent to the opening, around an axis extending transversely of the press direction, the die having one or more recesses in its peripheral surface for forming the blank into a three-dimensional section with transverse sectional parts during the rotation of the rotary die. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In continuous pressing of a plastically deformable blank, for example a heated metal such as aluminium, so-called extrusion, the blank passes an opening with a desired cross-sectional area, thereby forming a section whose longitudinal cross-section is constant. There is a great need for continuous manufacture of sections with transverse sectional parts, such as racks, hollow sections, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> International Patent Specification WO97/12745 discloses a method and a device invented by the present inventor, which aim at allowing extrusion of sections with sectional parts protruding transversely of the section. According to this publication, a rotary die is arranged to constitute part of the opening through which the blank is pressed. As the cross-sectional area of the blank is being reduced, the rotating die simultaneously forms it. The rotary die can be designed to produce transverse bars in the section, or to form a raised or embedded company name in the section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The difference compared to various types of die stamping with rotating elements is to be noted, illustrated for example in DE 42101746, where only a very limited forming of the blank takes place. When shaping according to the above technique, as referred to by the present invention, the rotating die forms part of the actual extrusion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The application of this technique in existing, largely standardised, press facilities such as hydraulic pressing plants, screw extruders, conform extrusion machines, etc, was previously impossible. Facilities of said type usually comprise a tool arrangement of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, with a support <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for a substantially cylindrical tool <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprising a fixed die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. There is not much space around this tool, and the forces generated during the pressing are very strong. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is very important that the number of production stoppages be reduced, since the cost of unexploited machine capacity is very high. It is, therefore, desirable that tools can be changed rapidly according to pressing needs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Since Patent Specification WO97/12745 was published, the need for sections with a cross-sectional area that varies longitudinally has arisen, i.e. a section having not only transverse sectional parts such as bars, but also a varying cross-section or material thickness along the continuous section. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to provide a device for pressing three-dimensional sections, which is easy to apply to moulds according to prior art, with no need for major adjustments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved by means of a device and a method of the type described by way of introduction, wherein said rotary die is arranged immediately down-stream of said opening, whereby the blank is reduced when passing through said opening (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) to substantially the predetermined cross-sectional area, and then formed when passing said rotary die, thereby determining the final shape of the three-dimensional section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Unlike prior art, the area of the blank is thus reduced substantially down to its final cross-sectional area upstream of the rotating die, whereby the forces acting on the rotating die can be minimised. This results in manageable bearing forces, which allows the bearings of the rotary die to be contained in the fixed die. The expression &ldquo;substantially down to&rdquo; means primarily down to between 100% and 130% of the final pre-determined cross-sectional area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The blank meets with the rotating die radially within its average radius. In this way, some area reduction still takes place at the rotating die, and thus a certain acceleration of the blank occurs during this passage while at the same time the material fills cavities in the rotating die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The expression &ldquo;immediately downstream of&rdquo; means that the rotary die is located so close to the opening that the pressure of the pressing is used in the shaping done by the rotating die. If the distance is too long, for example several times the across corner dimension of the section, the blank will self-lock adjacent to the rotating die because of the friction caused upstream against the supporting surfaces when the rotating die is in a pressing phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The rotary die is preferably mounted in bearings in a transverse cavity formed next to the opening, thereby being rotatable around an axis extending transversely of the pressing direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> This design of the fixed die allows a space-efficient location of the rotary die within the machine. Furthermore, this construction means that the rotary die is easily accessible, since it is relatively easy to loosen and remove the tool in a normal compression moulding machine. Thus, the device can be designed so as to be compatible with conventional extruding machines in order to allow rapid changing of tools without the need for expensive production stoppages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> By forming a cavity in the fixed die, the space is used as much as is possible, and, in addition, a smaller amount of toughened material is needed for the fixed die, which reduces the cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The rotary die is preferably mounted in bearings with a certain axial play. This play allows some thermal expansion of the rotating die without causing any jamming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The rotary die may be fixedly arranged on a shaft mounted in bearings in the cavity, the shaft having a limited axial play. Thus, owing to this construction the shaft is axially guided by the rotary die. Since the shaft and its bearings are arranged in the fixed die, this constitutes a unit in which the rotary die is arranged, the unit being easily replaceable. Moreover, the shaft may be relatively short, which results in a favourable load take-up capacity and less load on the bearings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A shaft portion extending through the rotary die can be made of a material with a higher thermal expansion coefficient than the rotary die, so that said shaft portion, when the rotary die and the shaft are heated during pressing, expands more than the rotary die, which is thereby secured to the shaft. By using this technique to secure the rotary die, the need for securing elements in the shaft and the die is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The opening preferably comprises a recess in the fixed die on the upstream side, which is intended to cause a first cross-sectional reduction of the material, the recess being substantially formed on the side of the opening opposite to the cavity. By forming the recess in this way, there is less stress on the fixed die at the cavity in which the rotary die is arranged. In a traditional type of tool, where the corresponding recess usually is symmetrical, the material around the cavity may become too thin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the invention, the device further comprises means for varying the cross-sectional area immediately upstream of the rotary die. In other words, the fixed die is arranged to have an opening with a variable cross section. Thus, the amount of material pressed against the rotary die may be varied, suitably according to the shape of the rotary die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The peripheral surface of the rotary die may, for example, present sectors with varying radius, which permits pressing of sections with varying cross-sectional area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;peripheral surface&rdquo; is here meant the normally circular-cylindrical surface in which different kinds of recesses or protrusions have been made for forming the sections, for example the surface that is made up by the pitch radius of a gear wheel. The fact that the radius of the peripheral surface varies could mean, for example, an oval-shaped die (such as a gear wheel with varying pitch radius), or that the shaft is arranged in connection with the rotary die slightly offset relative to the centre of the die. This would result in a section, whose continuous material thickness would vary cyclically, which is desirable when manufacturing a beam with varying strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The means for varying the cross-sectional area are suitably synchronised with the rotary die and may consist of supporting surfaces moveable transversely of the pressing direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the invention, the rotary die is arranged to be lockable in a predetermined position. Thus, the rotary, moveable die may be locked, and thereby essentially converted into a fixed die. Pressing may now take place, either by passing one rotary-die or by passing one or more fixed dies, which offers improved possibilities of varying the pressed sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The rotary die may suitably have smooth sectors, which in the locked position face the blank, so that, in this position, the blank passes the locked die for forming a smooth sectional segment. By orienting a smooth sector so that it faces the blank when locking the rotary die, the forces acting on the rotary die in the locked position are minimised. Locking the rotary die in a position where recesses or protrusions are oriented so that they face the blank would in fact require a great locking force and would, in addition, mean a risk of loose pieces forming in the cavities of the die during pressing.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a rough schematic representation of a machine intended for extrusion of metals such as aluminium, which have been heated to a plastically deformable state, wherein a ram <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is arranged by means of hydraulic actuators <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to press a blank <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> towards a tool arrangement <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an exploded view of the tool arrangement <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The tool arrangement comprises a die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which, together with a supporting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is arranged in a annular die holder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> located in front of one or more rear members <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in a tool support <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (also called &ldquo;horseshoe&rdquo; ). The die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the supporting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be replaced by a device according to the invention, or alternatively the dimensions of the die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the invention may be such that also the die holder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is excluded from the tool arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A die unit according to a first embodiment of the invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The die unit comprises a substantially cylindrical, fixed die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with an opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A blank <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is intended to be pressed through the opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a pressing direction A. A second opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is defined between the rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an opposite, preferably plane, supporting surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the material of the fixed die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. According to the invention, the first opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a cross-sectional area that is substantially the same as the cross-sectional area of the second opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The blank <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> passing the opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is brought in contact with the rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> approximately on a level with its inside radius r<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, preferably slightly within the radius r<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If a rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the form of a gear wheel <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is used, as in the-example shown, r<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> designates the pitch radius of the gear wheel, which makes up a peripheral surface from which the gear teeth <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> extend. It is important, regardless of the shape of the die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for the blank to hit the die on such a level that the blank <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is plastically deformed when passing the rotating die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The deformation of the blank <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is shown in more detail in the enlarged view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> With reference primarily to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it is shown how the rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotatable around an axis C. More particularly, it is fixedly mounted on a shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> mounted in bearings in a cavity <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the fixed die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The cavity <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> consists essentially of a transverse boring <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed beside the centre axis B of the die and extending transversely of the pressing direction A. The boring <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has a larger cross section in the areas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>at the respective ends, close to the edge of the die unit. Immediately inside these areas, the cross section of the boring is smaller, getting larger again, finally, in the most central part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>In the areas <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>two bearings <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are arranged, for example roller bearings or slide bearings, through which the shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> extends over the whole length of the boring. The die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is arranged in the central area <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and fixed laterally by axial bearings <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> arranged in the area <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the example shown, means for cooling the bearings <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are arranged in the die unit. The means comprise a ceramic body <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is fitted axially outside each bearing, a seal <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> located outside the body <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a supply conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for a cooling agent, such as nitrogen or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is suitably made of a material with a lower thermal expansion coefficient than at least the central shaft portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on which it is applied. In this way, the die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is effectively secured when the temperature of the whole die rises as a result of the extrusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is a front perspective view of the fixed die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, i.e. as seen from the point from which the blank <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is pressed, the opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a recess <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in the die, the recess causing a first reduction of the area when pressing. This counter-sink <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is assymetrically shaped in relation to the centre axis B of the die, and the major part of it is located on the side opposite to the cavity <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Shaping the recess <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> this way minimises those portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the die that are weakened, in the pressing direction A, both by the cavity <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the recess <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It appears from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that the cavity <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also has an orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the front of the fixed die <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, through which the rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is visible. The rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is mounted by being inserted through the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and then by the shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> being inserted through the boring <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and through the rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> According to a second embodiment (FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) of the invention, a fixed die <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises two rotary dies <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;, each arranged on a shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime; in a boring <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;. This construction permits pressing of sections that are profiled both on the upper side and on the underside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The two dies may be synchronised with each other in any appropriate way, for example by providing gear wheels to join the shafts <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime;. Through the synchronisation the distribution of the load take-up between the dies <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The fixed die <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> further comprises a core die <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> fixedly arranged on the die <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and extending through the opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the opening being divided in two openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, thereby permitting pressing of a hollow section. The core die <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, as shown in the perspective view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, comprises, in the embodiment shown, a cruciform portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, intended to be fixedly arranged on the die with the aid of fixing means <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as bolts, and an elongated portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> intended to extend, once the core die is arranged on the die, through the opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as far as or past the centre of the rotary dies. The side <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the core die facing the rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereby replaces the above mentioned supporting surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as the element defining the opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> while at the same time the opposite side <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>&prime; defines a second opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a fixed die <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> comprises a moveable supporting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in connection with the rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The movable supporting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is controlled by actuators <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> via link means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, only schematically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and is arranged to adjust the opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> depending on the size of the opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> between the rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the core die <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (alternatively the supporting surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the absence of the core die <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the supporting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be moved between a first starting position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), in which the opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is essentially the same as in the previously described embodiments, and a second lowered position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), in which the opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is reduced. This arrangement might be necessary, or at least advantageous, in situations where the peripheral surface of the rotary die has a varying radius, for example when the rotating die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> consists of an oval gear wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the die <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the rotary die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is of the same type as in the above examples, but arranged on the shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> slightly offset from the shaft centre. Thus, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the material of the pressed section gets a larger cross section T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the centre X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the rotary die is located above the shaft centre X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> whereas, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the material of the pressed section gets a smaller cross section T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the centre X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the rotary die is located below the shaft centre X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The purpose of arranging the supporting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to reduce the opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is to adapt the cross-sectional area of the blank <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> pressed towards the opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the altered cross sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Another situation when a moveable supporting surface may be suitable is when using a die <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>This die is provided with a rotary die <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> having smooth portions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, which take up an angle sector that is several times bigger than the usual protrusions (gear teeth). In the example shown, a smooth portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is formed in the rotary die <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> taking up about 30 degrees of the circumference of the die <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>pressing is performed in the same way as described above, with the supporting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the starting position. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>however, the smooth portion has reached the opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which is thus given a reduced cross-sectional area. In order to achieve a satisfactory extrusion also in this position, the supporting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is moved to a lowered position by the actuator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, whereby the opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the die <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be arranged to be lockable in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>When the die is in this locked position a straight section without transverse sectional parts can be extruded between the smooth portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and the core die <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, alternatively the supporting surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> are only intended to illustrate the principle behind the described embodiments. A person skilled in the art realises that several of the distances shown in the Figures do not correspond to reality, for example in the case of the inclination of the supporting surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which is exaggerated in order to facilitate understanding. As a consequence of this exaggeration also the distance between the supporting surface and the rotating die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is slightly too long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The rotary dies described above may be arranged, as appropriate, to be driven, thereby adding extra power to the extrusion process. A person skilled in the art can provide this drive, for example by connecting the shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime; to a driven shaft arranged in the tool support <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In particular, this drive may be advantageous when pressing sections with varying material thickness, for example as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that details of the embodiments shown in the Figures and described above can be combined in an optional way. For example, the core die <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be excluded when pressing solid sections. The number of rotary dies may vary in all embodiments, and it is mainly for the sake of clarity that most Figures show only one die. </paragraph>
