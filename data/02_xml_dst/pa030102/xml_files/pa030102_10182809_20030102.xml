<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an aeration and deaeration device for the fuel tank of an internal combustion engine according to the preamble of patent claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such a device is known from German Patent 198 13 321 A1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the problem of determining the composition of the backwashing air more easily and in particular to be able to take this into account with regard to changes during backwashing operation. It should also be possible in engine control to take into account the volume flow and temperature in addition to the composition of the backwashing air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This problem is solved by an embodiment of a generic device according to the characterizing features of patent claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Expedient and advantageous embodiments are the object of the subclaims, which also concern methods executable using this device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This invention is based essentially on the general idea of temporarily passing an air flow in circulation through the packing of the adsorption filter and thereby determine the loading state by means of a sensor mounted in the circulation. Regeneration of the adsorption filter by backwashing may be performed in this way as a function of the loading state determined previously. If, in circulating flow, the loading state detected on the adsorption filter is such that regeneration by backwashing is necessary or desirable, then the same sensor that detected the loading state of the adsorption filter in circulating flow continuously determines the composition of the fluid removed from the circulation line. The fluid leaving the circulation line, i.e., the loaded rinsing air, is sent in particular to the air intake area of the engine. Simultaneously with determination of the composition of the backwashing air, which in principle involves only the hydrocarbon content, the volume flow and temperature of the backwashing air can also be determined. All such state data detected can be used for engine control in supplying purging air into the air intake area of the engine, so that there is no influence on the combustion process that would interfere with the exhaust gas composition during the period when the purging air is being fed into the combustion process. The latter measures, however, are not necessary in this form if the purging air is added directly to the engine exhaust, for example, as is possible in a known manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To determine the loading of the adsorption filter with hydrocarbons, it may be sufficient that only a partial area of the filter guide is situated inside the flow circulation which is connected actively for the determination of loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The sensor which detects the substance properties and optionally the flow properties and state properties of the purging air may be integrated into an electronic device in which the data detected is processed (further) for forwarding to a central engine control. Sensors that detect the filling level and the pressure inside the tank, namely a pressure sensor and a filling level sensor, may be connected to this electronic device. Therefore, there is an extra electronic device which is separate from the central engine electronics and is connected only to it and may compile all the measurement and control data pertaining to the tank and its aeration and deaeration. This separate electronic device may be part of the adsorption filter, so that an easily handled adsorption filter module is created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An exemplary embodiment, which is explained in greater detail below, is illustrated in the drawing; in this embodiment, the backwashing air is sent to the air intake area of the internal combustion engine.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A fuel tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the atmosphere via an aeration and deaeration device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&Prime; with a dust filter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> connected in between. With partial area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, the aeration and deaeration line coming from tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> opens into an adsorption filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is backwashable for regeneration. The connection between this filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the atmosphere is formed by area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the aeration and deaeration line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For backwashing filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with air from the atmosphere, a purging air line <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> leads into the intake air area of an internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A bypass line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> branches off from a flow area situated between the inlet and outlet openings of the aeration and deaeration line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&Prime;, to the purging air line <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which opens into a 3/2-way valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. A sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a delivery pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are situated between the 3/2-way valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the adsorption filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Cutoff valves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are provided in the individual areas <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the aeration and deaeration line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be connected to a filling level sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which detects the filling level of the tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a pressure sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which detects the pressure inside the tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The device described above functions as follows. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Aeration and Deaeration Operation of the Fuel Tank </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In deaeration and aeration operation of tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the cutoff valves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are opened, so that fluid may flow through the adsorption filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in both directions for aeration and deaeration. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Regeneration of the Adsorption Filter by Backwashing </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The device described here makes it possible to make a backwashing depend on the degree of loading of filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with hydrocarbons. To determine the degree of loading, a circulating air stream is passed through the filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> according to certain specifications, which may depend only on time. The flow paths of the air circulation are determined by the purging air line <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the delivery pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the 3/2-way valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the backwashing line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a partial area of the packing of adsorption filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. To activate the circulating flow, the delivery pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is turned on while the cutoff valves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are closed. With sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the hydrocarbon loading of the packing of the adsorption filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> If the device is operated so that backwashing is to be performed at a certain loading state of filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, then backwashing is initiated whenever a corresponding loading threshold value has been detected by the sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The backwashing is then initiated by switching the 3/2-way valve and opening the cutoff valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> after the state data on the purging air as measured by sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> have already been sent to the central engine control. The state data on the rinsing air, namely in particular the hydrocarbon content, the volume flow and temperature, are sent through the sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the central engine control during the entire purging air operation, so that changes of state in the engine control can be taken into account continuously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this way, it is possible to completely suppress an interfering influence of the purging air on the exhaust gas composition by taking into account the state data of the purging air during purging air operation with the help of the engine control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Backwashing of the adsorption filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can also be made dependent on the degree of tank filling by coupling the filling level data on tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the state data on the purging air detected in sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and relaying this data jointly to the central engine control. For example, it is fundamentally possible at a certain degree of emptying of tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to perform backwashing of the filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> independently of the degree of loading of the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With the device described here, it is also possible to perform a leakage test on tank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and its inlet and outlet lines, including the adsorption filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by switching the 3/2-way valve to circulation flow, turning on the delivery pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, closing the cutoff valve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and opening the cutoff valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be part of an electronic device, which is also used to receive and process further the tank filling level data and pressure data, in addition to receiving and further processing of the state data on the purging air. This electronic device may be integrated into the housing of the filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> together with the valves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the delivery pump <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the 3/2-way valve. Thus, even extremely short lines <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are achieved through corresponding integration into the filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Essentially the circulation flow of the purging gas according to this invention is also suitable for the case in which the loading state of the adsorption filter is to be measured only as a function of certain time and/or state data in order to be able to determine the prerequisite for the required backwashing. Such a prerequisite may consist, for example, of exceeding a predetermined load limit value at which backwashing is to be performed. The backwashing air may be sent further in various ways, i.e., including directly into the exhaust gas, for example. </paragraph>
