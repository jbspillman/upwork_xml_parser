<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to grinding machines and to grinding wheels for use in such machines for grinding notches in the edges of discs such as wafers of silicon for use in the construction of semi-conductor devices, and to methods of grinding edge regions of such discs so as to form notches therein. Since the notches are of relatively small dimensions relative to the size of the wafers, grinding wheels used to form such notches are commonly referred to as grinding pins. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A grinding machine for grinding discs is disclosed in WO97/48522 and incorporated herein by reference. WO97/48522 discloses use of a metal-bonded CBN or diamond wheel on a grinding machine to rough grind the edge of a disc, such as a semiconductor wafer, before use of a softer resin-bonded CBN wheel for finish grinding the disc edge and further describes an in situ technique for forming and re-forming a groove in the resin bonded CBN grinding wheel to grind the correct shape around the disc edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The machine also includes a small diameter grinding pin for grinding a notch of predetermined proportions around the edge of the ground disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> British Patent Specification No. 2335620 discloses a grinding pin for notch grinding, for example for use in the machine described in WO 97/48522, the pin having a cylindrical region sufficiently long that a succession of profiled grooves for producing the notch can be formed, whereby as one such groove becomes too worn for further use one or more further grooves can be formed in the pin. One embodiment of pin described in the Specification is a pin having a metal bonded diamond section axially nearer the pin spindle and a resin bonded formable section axially more remote from the spindle. In use, a groove in the metal bonded section is used for rough grinding the notch and a groove formed in the resin bonded formable section is used for finish grinding the notch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A problem with the aforesaid arrangement of the grinding pin is that of aligning the metal bonded and the resin bonded sections. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, a grinding pin for notch grinding comprises a cylindrical region long enough for at least two profiled grooves to be formed thereon respectively in axially spaced sections of the cylindrical region, the section axially more remote from the pin spindle being a resin-bonded section of rough grit for rough grinding the notch and the section axially nearer the pin spindle being a resin-bonded section of fine grit for finish grinding the notch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention overcomes the problem of aligning the respective sections to be used for rough and finish grinding the notch, because it is possible to use the same groove dressing or forming wheel, mounted on the same machine, to form both or all the grooves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the size of the grit for rough grinding the notch is between two and three times the size of the grit for finish grinding the notch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Either or both of the rough grinding and finish grinding sections of the cylindrical pin, but especially the latter, may be long enough for one or more further grooves to be successively formed when the first groove becomes too worn for further use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a grinding machine, preferably a CNC grinding machine, having a work spindle, a grinding spindle able to carry a blank for the aforesaid grinding pin, the blank having a section of rough grit and a section of fine grit, and a forming wheel rotatable to form a notch-grinding groove in the rough grit section and a notch-finishing groove in the fine grit section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention therefore also relates to a method of forming notches of rough grinding and notch-finishing grooves on the aforesaid grinding machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The forming wheel may be mounted on the same spindle as the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The grinding material may be rough grit resin-bonded CBN or diamond in the case of the rough grinding section and fine grit resin-bonded diamond in the case of the finish grinding section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;resin-bonded&rdquo;, as used herein, includes bonding with a vitreous material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, in contrast to the disclosure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> of British Patent Specification No. 2335620, wherein a resin-bonded section is used in place of a metal-bonded section, it is preferable for the section for finish grinding to be nearer the pin spindle, i.e. the stiffer section of the pin.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> illustrate pictorially part of an overall machine station for notch grinding circular discs (wafers) of silicon or similar material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The machine shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprises a control cabinet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from which extends a machine bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which carries a floating platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> carried on three vibration absorbing feet, one of which can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the second part <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is mounted centrally before the base region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and is shown in dotted outline in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and the third can be seen at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes an integral support structure or base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which carries a workhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is slidable axially along a slideway <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> mounted on an upper surface of the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and which includes a spindle drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and vacuum chuck <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for carrying wafers to be ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Edge grinding is achieved by means of a grinding wheel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> containing a number of annular grooves such as <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for engaging the edge of a wafer workpiece designated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The grinding wheel spindle (not shown) carried in bearing assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is rotated by an electric motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Items <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are carried on a support generally designated <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is mounted close to the centre line of the platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to one side of a rigid strengthening plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is bolted through flanges to the platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along its base and is secured at its upper end by bolts through another flange <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to the machine base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The function of the plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is to increase the rigidity of the platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and resist transverse vibrations which might otherwise be introduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Equidistant from and on the other side of the plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a second support <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which carries a slideway <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on which is mounted a second spindle drive <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which carries a notch grinding spindle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> having a notch grinding pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> at one end, and associated spindle motor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Axial movement of the spindle drive <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided by a drive unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The spindle drive <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can also be used to grind the internal diameter of an annular disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The workhead edge grinding and notch grinding spindles are mounted in air bearings and the workhead spindle typically has a speed range of 2 to 1000 revs per minute, the edge grinding spindle typically has a speed range up to 6000 revolutions per minute and the speed of the notch grinding spindle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is typically up to 70,000 revolutions per minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> On the workhead spindle to the rear of the chuck <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are mounted forming wheels best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Indexing the workhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> allows the workpiece disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be engaged by one of the slots such as <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the grinding wheel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and further movement in the direction of the arrow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> allows the disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to clear the end face <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the grinding wheel assembly and to allow the forming wheels <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to engage in the appropriate grooves in the grinding wheel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Lateral movement of the grinding wheel or notch grinder as required is achieved by tilting the support structures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as appropriate relative to the platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. To this end both of the structures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are pivotally attached to the platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> near the centre line thereof and two stops <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> respectively (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) prevent excessive outward movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The pivoting is provided by means of flexures (as will be described) which allow for pivoting movement about two parallel axes close to the centre line of the platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can describe a small arc such as denoted by arrow <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and structure <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can describe an arc as denoted by reference numeral <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Drive means for achieving the pivoting movement will be described with reference to later figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Attached to the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a clear polycarbonate rectilinear housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> through which the grinding wheel spindle protrudes. A large, generally oval opening <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in the face of the housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> allows a similarly shaped closure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> mounted on the workhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to enter and seal off the opening <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> upon appropriate forward movement of the workhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as aforesaid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> An inflatable ring seal <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> around the closure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (or alternatively around the internal lip of the opening <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>) provides for a fluid tight seal between the closure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the opening <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is slidable relative to the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and bellows seals <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are provided between the spindle drives <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so that after the seal has been made between the closure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the opening <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will in fact move axially with the workhead assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Sufficient clearance is provided to the rear of the bellows to allow the housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to move in a continuing sense in the direction of the arrow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to allow for the grooves in the grinding wheel to be formed. Movement in the opposite sense is also accommodated by the bellows <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> so that the closed housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can also follow the workhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as it moves in an opposite sense to that of arrow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to allow for the edge of the disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be engaged by one of the grinding grooves such as <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Coolant fluid is sprayed onto the workpiece through nozzles <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and similar nozzles are provided for spraying similar fluid onto the forming wheels when required. An interlock is provided to prevent coolant fluid being jetted unless the housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is closed and sealed by the closure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> After a grinding operation has been completed and after a final wash with fluid, the housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be opened by deflating the edge seal <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and withdrawing the workhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a direction opposite to that of arrow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The finished workpiece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can then be demounted and a fresh workpiece installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Wheel Forming/Dressing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Wheel forming can be performed initially before any workpiece has been mounted, in which case the housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is closed by appropriate movement of the workhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and closure <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> without first mounting a workpiece such as <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the chuck <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Wheel forming is performed by appropriate axial movement of the workhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and lateral movement of support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, so that each of the grooves, such as groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, is engaged by the appropriate forming wheel such as <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Coolant fluid is provided during the wheel forming operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> After initial wheel forming, the assembly may be separated by breaking the seal <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> as before mentioned. After mounting a workpiece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the assembly can be closed again and grinding undertaken as before described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Typically re-forming of the groove is performed during machine downtime after one workpiece has been removed and before a subsequent workpiece has been installed, but in a development of the machine in which edge profile checking of the workpiece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is performed in situ on the workhead, it may be advantageous to allow for re-forming with the workpiece in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Notching </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> If a workpiece is to be notched, the support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is moved laterally to disengage the wheel from the workpiece and support <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is moved laterally instead so as to engage the edge of the workpiece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by the notching pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. After notching, the support <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is moved in an opposite sense so as to disengage the pin from the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Polishing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In an alternative arrangement, a polishing wheel may be mounted on the wheel spindle as well as the grooved grinding wheel, and by axially shifting the workpiece spindle, so the polishing wheel can be brought into engagement with the edge of the workpiece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A drive for shifting the workhead <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> along the slideway <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is provided at <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> drainpipe <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> conveys fluid from the housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to a storage tank <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and a pump (not shown) is provided to recirculate the fluid from the tank. A filter may be provided in the tank or in the line between the tank and the pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The control housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a television display <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and keyboard <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and a hand-held control unit <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is connected via a flying lead <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a connection plug <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. An operator can remove the unit <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and walk to the machine with the unit <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in his hand, and by pressing appropriate buttons instigate or arrest operation of the machine. The housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> houses a computer based control system for supplying control signals and power to the drives on the machine and for receiving signals from transducers, switching and other position/operation/touch etc signal generating sensors on the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The slideway <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on which the workhead slides, is preloaded, and the workhead is driven by server motors and fitted with a high resolution position coder to provide smooth motion during axis move interpolation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Grinding infeed is achieved as previously described by tilting the structures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as required to bring the grinding element carried thereon into engagement with the edge of the workpiece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Although the movement is not truly linear, but arcuate, this can be accommodated in the control signals generated by the control system housed within the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Whilst the jets such as <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can be used to supply cutting fluid during grinding, they or other jets may be used to direct jets of cieaning fluid at the overhanging lip of the wafer whilst it is still being rotated but after grinding. This prevents grinding swarf from running down the back face of the wafer as it is removed from the chuck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Grinding Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Typically edges are ground in a two-stage process using a plunge grind roughing operation and a second plunge grind finish cycle which includes a rapid advance of the grinding wheel until a touch sensor detects contact with the workpiece wafer. The grinding wheel axis position at touchdown is used to monitor wheel wear and to ensure that the material removed per finish cut cycle is kept constant. Grinding wheelforms are maintained by using metal-bonded diamond forming wheels permanently mounted on the workhead chuck. The reforming process can be fully automatic and can be programmed to occur every nth wafer, or whenever the ground edge profile becomes unacceptable (as determined by optical inspection of the disc edge profile) or when the touchdown point indicates excessive wheel wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Damping </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce unwanted vibration and resulting grinding damage to the minimum, the structural components making up the grinding machine are filled at least partially with polymer concrete, particularly sections of the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and if desired also the platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Subassembly Flexure Mounting </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates how the two structures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are mounted for hinging movement to permit wheel infeed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the inboard edges of the two structures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are connected to the platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by means of flexures (sometimes referred to as strip-hinges) one of which is shown at <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A second pair of flexures are provided towards the other end of the structures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> nearer to the machine base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Whilst the flexures <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> permit tilting of the structures about one axis, they do not readily permit any other movement of the structures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> relative to the platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> about any other axis. Consequently the coupling of the structures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to the platform <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is very stiff in all directions except about the hinge axis of the flexures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Cam Drive </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a side view of the end of the machine, albeit to a slightly reduced scale. As with the other views, it is shown partly cut-away so as to reveal the cam drive mechanism generally designated <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> which acts on the structure <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A captive washer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is shown at the side of the drive mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> also shows the two flexure mountings at the base of the unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the outboard one being designated <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the inboard one being designated <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As previously mentioned each of the cam drive arrangements is carried within a rigid housing <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the latter is more clearly visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as is the horizontal leg <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by which it is bolted to a protruding plate from the end of the base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Also visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is the motor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> for driving the chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> from which the notch grinding spindle <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> protrudes. The motor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is carried within a housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> previously described in respect of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and the housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> slides along a slideway <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the bellows seal <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> attaching the housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> sealingly to the opening in the casing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, through which the motor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and spindle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> carrying pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> protrude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The notch grinding pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is now discussed in more detail in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The formable cylindrical grinding pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is carried by a smaller diameter cylindrical metal spindle <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and core <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for fitting to the spindle (not shown) of a grinding machine. The cylindrical grinding pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is of approximately 4 mm diameter by 10 mm axial extent in which first and second grooves <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) are formed in situ by the same forming wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The pin is formed of resin-bonded diamond, resin-bonded grinding grit or vitreous-bonded material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Reverting to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the cylindrical surface of the pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is divided into two sections, namely a fine grit section <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> nearer the pin spindle <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a rough grit section <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> further from the pin spindle <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The rough grit is two to three times the size of the fine grit. Moreover, from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the first groove <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is formed in the rough grit section <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. In use, this groove <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is used for rough grinding a notch. The second groove <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, used for finish grinding the notch, is formed in the stiffer fine grit section <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the pin nearer the pin spindle <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In use, during a first pass, the rough notch-grinding groove <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with a pre-machined notch in the edge of a stationary semi-conductor disc (not shown) to rough grind the notch. During a second pass, the notch-finishing groove <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the disc to finish grind the notch. The pin may be rotated, for grinding purposes, at speeds of the order of 30,000 rpm or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Both grooves <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> have the same groove profile, and their axial position relative to each other is precisely known. Thus the cutting forces during the finishing pass are constant, which enhances the surface finish and the consistency of the notch profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In practice the rough groove <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> removes approximately 90% of the notch material, while the finishing groove <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> removes the remainder. Both the wheel and the disc move during this operation, and the relevant two axes are used to interpolate the notch profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Either one or both sections <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may be made sufficiently long to enable second or more rough-grinding or finish-grinding grooves to be formed, in the same machine, when the first groove <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> wears out and is no longer reformable. This extends the life of the pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> before it needs replacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As the use of a relatively long pin increases the risk of whip, it is important that the finish-grinding notch <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (or replacement notch or notches) are formed in the stiffer section of the pin nearer the pin spindle <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Generally, the life of the rough-grinding notch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> will substantially exceed the life of the finish-grinding notch <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, but provision can be made if desired for the formation of a replacement rough-grinding notch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Although not shown, the groove-forming wheel may, to advantage for alignment purposes, be mounted on the work spindle carrying the workpiece in which the notch is to be ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> When the pin is used on a CNC grinding machine, the latter can be programmed automatically to calculate the diameter of the root of the grooves in the notch grinding pin and compensate by interpolation to produce the desired form of notch during the grinding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A CNC grinding machine such as that described in WO97/48522 may be used to mount the notch grinding pin and the groove forming wheel. </paragraph>
