<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A current measuring device (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) for a multi-pole low voltage circuit breaker (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). comprises a support body (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) with a through opening for a current conductor (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) for each of the poles and a receiving chamber (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), surrounding the through opening (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>), for secondary components (<highlight><bold>26, 31</bold></highlight>) of current sensors and/or current transformers. The support body (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) is essentially plate-like and rectangular and forms part of the rear wall (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) of the circuit breaker (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). Should Rogowski coils (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) be used as secondary components of a transformer, then adjustable voltage dividers are also mounted on the support body for interdependent adjustment. The multi-pole current measuring device (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) simplifies the production of circuit breakers as approved components. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a multipole low-voltage circuit breaker having an enclosure and having one current detection device for each pole, with each current detection device having an electrical conductor, which is associated with a switching contact system for that pole, and a secondary part through which the electrical conductor passes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Circuit breakers of the stated type have been disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,779 or U.S. Pat. No. 347,623 (Design Patent) in conjunction with U.S. Pat. No. 4,497,992. The current detection devices provided there have the object of producing a signal which is dependent on the current flowing in each of the poles and which is evaluated in an overcurrent tripping device, in order to interrupt a circuit for protection of loads and electrical systems. Since, in some circumstances, only one of the poles of a circuit breaker may be affected by a high fault current, each of the poles is equipped with a current detection device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The secondary parts of the current detection devices generally comprise a mount and a winding which is fit to it and which may be a single-layer winding or a multilayer winding. Furthermore, these components are generally provided with an enclosure or a casing for protection against damage and against external influences. During the process of manufacturing a low-voltage circuit breaker, the secondary parts of the current detection devices are selected and mounted individually in accordance with the user&apos;s requirements. Suitable recesses or pockets are provided for this purpose on the rear face of the enclosure of the circuit breakers, through which the electrical conductors which are connected, to the switching contact systems extend, and at the same time form connecting means for connection to a circuit that is to be protected. Once the secondary parts have been pushed onto the electrical conductors, suitable sealing covers are fit to the rear face of the enclosure, in order firstly to protect the secondary parts of the current detection devices, and in order secondly to support the electrical conductors on the enclosure of the circuit breaker, as close as possible to their connection point. The reason for this measure is that circuit breakers of the type mentioned are subject to extraordinarily high mechanical forces in the event of a short circuit, which can lead to damage to the circuit breaker and to the conductors continuing on from them if busbars are not adequately supported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on the object of improving the current detection in multipole low-voltage circuit breakers, and of simplifying the installation of the current detection devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the secondary parts of the current detection devices for all the poles of the circuit breaker are arranged in a common mounting body, which has aperture openings for the electrical conductors as well as attachment means for detachable connection of the mounting body to the enclosure of the circuit breaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The combination, as envisaged according to the invention, of the secondary parts of the current detection devices of all the poles to form a standard assembly makes it possible to provide units, which are matched to one another and are tested together, for current detection in multipole circuit breakers. This reduces the time required for mechanical installation and calibration and adjustment of the completed circuit breaker. The multipole mounting body at the same time improves the mechanical strength, by supporting the electrical conductors in a cohesive body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The mounting body which is provided according to the invention may have recesses for holding the secondary parts, with these secondary parts being mounted in the recesses by encapsulating them with a synthetic resin compound. It is thus possible to use the same materials and production methods not only for production of the mounting body but also for the attachment of the secondary parts, as those which are already known for the production of the enclosures and of enclosure parts of circuit breakers, and of the associated single-pole current detection devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of the invention, the mounting body, which essentially has a rectangular outline and is in the form of a panel may be configured as part of a rear wall of the enclosure of the circuit breaker, with the recesses which have been mentioned being arranged on that side of the mounting body which faces the interior of the circuit breaker. This arrangement provides good protection for the secondary parts against damage during handling of the circuit breaker and has a good protective effect on the electrical conductors which are associated with the current detection devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As already mentioned, the current detection devices for low-voltage circuit breakers may be of widely differing types. One frequently used type is the transposed conductor current transformer, which has a nonmagnetic mount surrounding the electrical conductor and has a single-layer winding, whose start and end are directly adjacent to one another. The output variable from a current sensor such as this is, in contrast to inductive current transformers, dependent not only on the number of turns, but also on their geometrical distribution and arrangement. According to one refinement of the invention, in this context, it is possible to compensate for the different transmission response of the transposed conductor current transformer resulting from manufacturing tolerances by each of the transposed conductor current transformers having an associated voltage divider, which is composed of resistors, and by these voltage dividers likewise being fit to the mounting body. The adjustment of the transposed conductor current transformers can therefore be carried out before they are installed in a circuit breaker, which represents a simplification in comparison to the previously required matching and calibration of the completed circuit breaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The voltage dividers which have been mentioned may each be configured such that they can be adjusted by means of an adjustment element, with all the adjustment elements being arranged in an accessible manner on the rearward face of the mounting body. The current transformers and current sensors can thus be adjusted conveniently during the production process. However, in order to ensure that the adjustment which has been carried out is maintained in all circumstances, it is recommended that it be possible to protect the adjustment elements against inadvertent operation by means of an access barrier, which can be fit once the adjustment process has been carried out. In this case, an encapsulation compound which covers each of the adjustment elements is particularly suitable for use as the access barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As already mentioned, the current detection devices in a low-voltage circuit breaker provide output variables which are processed in a tripping device. The auxiliary energy which is required for operation of such a tripping device is generally likewise obtained from the electrical conductors of the circuit breaker by means of a current transformer. In this case, it has frequently been found to be expedient to provide a separate current transformer, which is independent of the described current detection devices, in order to provide the auxiliary energy. In this context, it is already known for a current sensor which is provided only for measurement purposes, and for an inductive current transformer, which is used to provide auxiliary energy, to be arranged in a common enclosure. For the purposes of the invention, this method of construction can also be used in a multipole mounting body, in such a way that a least one separate current transformer, which is used for supplying power, is arranged on the common mounting body.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The low-voltage circuit breaker <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has an enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, on whose rear wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> busbars <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> project, for connection to an external circuit. The busbars <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are part of a switching contact system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which has a stationary switching contact <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as well as a movable switching contact <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. An arc-quenching chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, for quenching switching arcs that occur when the switching contacts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are open, is located above the switching contact system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The movable switching contact <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is fit to a movable contact mount <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which can be operated for opening and closing by means of a drive apparatus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The electrical conductors <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected directly to the switching contact arrangement <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and are supported on a rear wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with respect to all the forces that occur. The opening of the switching contact arrangement <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the event of a fault is controlled by a tripping device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is indicated above the drive apparatus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, the tripping device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives signals from a current detection device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> whose primary part includes the lower electrical conductor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is surrounded by a secondary part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of a current sensor. This may, in a known manner, be an inductive current transformer, a current transformer without an iron core based on a transposed conductor coil, as well as the sensors which act on the basis of other known principles. For the present purposes, the components of a current detection device also include auxiliary current transformers which are provided, in a known manner, for supplying the operating power or auxiliary power to the electronic tripping device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> show how the secondary parts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are arranged and accommodated in a three-pole version of the circuit breaker <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The essential feature for the arrangement of the secondary parts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> according to the invention is a mounting body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is common to all the poles that there are in the circuit breaker <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and may be composed of a molded material, such as that which is also used to produce enclosure parts for the circuit breaker <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The mounting body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a suitable rectangular aperture opening <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for the upper electrical conductors <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of each pole of the circuit breaker <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in particular in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, this aperture opening <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> lies in the plane of the rear wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the circuit breaker <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that the support for the busbars <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is removed as far as possible from the stationary switching contact <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, thus resulting in a good supporting effect. Each of the aperture openings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is surrounded by a holding chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is used to hold the secondary parts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the current detection devices <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As already mentioned, current transformers may also be accommodated in the holding chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and are used to supply power to the tripping device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For attachment to the rear face of the circuit breaker <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the mounting body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has on its lower longitudinal edge a web <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, with a corresponding groove being provided on the rear wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the circuit breaker <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in order to hold this web <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Recesses <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the edges and aperture openings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> between the poles on the longitudinal edge of the mounting body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> opposite the web <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are provided for attachment means, in particular for screws which engage in the enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In conjunction with the web <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, this results in the mounting body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being held securely on the rear wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As an example of a current sensor, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a transposed conductor coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with connecting lines <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> indicated, which corresponds to the secondary part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A coil such as this supplies a signal which can be evaluated electronically, in order to control the tripping device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which has been mentioned. This requires auxiliary power in order to make it possible to carry out the necessary evaluation and calculation processes and, when necessary, to operate a tripping magnet. A separate auxiliary current transformer with a secondary part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in order to provide this auxiliary power, and its primary winding is formed by the associated electrical conductor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the circuit breaker <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), as in the case of the transposed conductor coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The secondary part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> has an iron core <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a secondary winding <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> seated on it. An electrical conductor which is used for the primary winding is indicated by dashed-dotted lines, for simplicity, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows how the secondary parts as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> are accommodated in the holding chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the mounting body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The right-hand one of the holding chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will be considered first of all. As can be seen, the holding chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a hollow-cylindrical exterior and is matched to the diameter of the transposed conductor coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The inner boundary of the holding chamber is formed by a collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which surrounds the aperture opening <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The left-hand part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a state which occurs during the manufacture of a current detection device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, in which a transposed conductor coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a secondary part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of an auxiliary current transformer are introduced into a holding chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The transposed conductor coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in this case touches the bottom of the holding chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and is aligned on its hollow-cylindrical circumferential surface. The secondary part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the auxiliary current transformer, which is seated on the collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, is located above this. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Although it would be possible to mount the coil arrangements in the holding chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by means of a cover which can be connected to the mounting body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, encapsulation with a synthetic resin compound is preferred. This encloses the coils and connecting lines on the secondary parts, and thus provides good protection against all external influences. Such encapsulation with a synthetic resin compound <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is illustrated in the central part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> also shows that a lower region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the mounting body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is configured in a closed manner between the central holding chamber and the right-hand holding chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The adjustment elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) for the voltage dividers which are associated with the current sensors and the transposed conductor coils <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are located in this area. These adjustment elements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> need be adjusted only once, once the current detection device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has been completed. In order to avoid random operation subsequently, an access barrier <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may be provided, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. This is a cover which is attached by means of a screw that is prevented from rotating by means of a tab <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The combination of the secondary parts of the current sensors and auxiliary current transformers of all the poles of a circuit breaker results in an assembly which is ready for installation and is electrically adjusted. The calibration of the secondary parts, and a complete test of a multipole current detection device, may be carried out before installation in the circuit breaker, which represents a considerable simplification. This reliably avoids faults, for example as a result of confusion between previously selected secondary parts that have been provided. This also ensures that all the secondary parts are arranged at a defined distance from one another, which cannot be varied, and that subsequent faults and tolerance problems are precluded. </paragraph>
