<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a soil manipulating tool. As used in this specification and the accompanying claims the term &ldquo;soil&rdquo; includes other generally friable substances of a similar nature including compost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The tool according to the present invention has a particular application, but not exclusive application in domestic gardening and removal of compost from a compost bin. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As is common, during the course of gardening it is often necessary to plant small plants or seedlings and to do so a relatively small hole needs to be dug. Conventional tools for digging such holes includes small spades and hoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> During domestic composting of material it is common to compost material in a compost container which has an open bottom so that the composted material is simply left lying on the ground. In this situation the compost is generally easy to move from one place to another with a spade because the compost container can be removed from the composted material thereby leaving the composted material sitting on the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In more recent times, compost containers which do not have an open bottom have been proposed. In these compost containers various mechanisms are installed in order to provide better composting of material. However, the removal of the composted material from these containers is somewhat more difficult. It is possible that the composted material can be tipped out of the container although, depending on the nature of the container, this may not be easy to do. Also, because of the height of this type of composting container, it is not easy to remove the composted material with a shovel or other conventional tool. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a soil manipulating tool for manipulating soil, including; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> a soil penetrating portion comprising a helical or spiral member; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> the helical or spiral member defining a substantially cylindrical cavity in which a plug of soil can locate, the cavity extending substantially the entire length of the soil penetrating portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to this invention when the tool is rotated to drive the tool into the soil in generally screw fashion, a plug of the soil is accommodated in the cavity so that the plug of soil can be manipulated by the tool. The manipulation may comprise removal of the plug of soil from the body into which the tool is driven by simply withdrawing the tool from the body, or loosening or aerating the soil by rotating the tool in the soil so as to churn the soil which is located in the cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment the tool includes a handle coupled to the soil penetrating portion. However, in other embodiments the tool could be configured for coupling to a power tool for driving the tool or to a power take off to a motor driven machine or vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention the helical or spiral member is formed from rod or wire. The cross-sectional shape of the rod or wire may be diamond shaped, circular shaped, or rectangular shaped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention the handle portion is formed integral with the soil penetrating portion and formed by bending one end of the soil penetrating portion into a handle shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments the handle portion may be a separate component in the form of a rod or beam which is connected to the soil penetrating portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The tool may include an abutment portion disposed between the handle and the soil penetrating portion for abutting against a surface of the soil into which the tool is to be driven so that when the abutment member abuts the surface of the soil the tool can be rotated without further penetrating into the soil so as to facilitate churning up of the soil upon rotation of the tool. This embodiment of the invention has particular application for use with soils which are relatively hard or dense such as the ground. In situations where the soil is relatively loose such as the case with composting, churning of the soil can take place by simply rotating the tool and, by manual force preventing the tool from further winding into the soil so that a churning action is achieved rather than further penetration of the tool. If the soil is relatively hard continued rotation will simply tend to draw the tool into the soil in cork screw like fashion without any particular churning of the soil. However, since the abutment member will abut the surface of the soil this will prevent further penetration of the tool into the soil and continued rotation will therefore cause a churning up of the soil rather than further penetration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another advantageous embodiment of the invention the tool may include a blade member which extends across the cavity at one spiral of the helical or spiral soil penetrating portion. In this embodiment of the invention the blade has the effect of loosening soil within the cavity upon rotation of the tool whilst enabling a plug of soil above the blade to be removed upon extraction of the tool from the soil. This leaves a hole with a mass of loosened soil at the bottom of the hole which is therefore able to be used for the planting of seedlings or small plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention the helical or spiral member may be hollow so that liquid can be applied to the tool and flow through the hollow member, the tool having an outlet opening arranged at an end of the hollow member opposite the handle portion so that the liquid can flow out of the hollow member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of the invention may also include a liquid pump which can be attached to the hollow tube to facilitate pumping of the fluid through the tool. This embodiment is advantageous in applying a liquid fertilizer or water to the soil as the soil is manipulated by the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention the tool may have a reinforced tip at its end remote from the handle to facilitate penetration of the tip of the tool into the soil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The hole which allows exit of the fluid is preferably located in the rod or wire soil penetrating portion adjacent the reinforced tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments the tool includes means for increasing the size of a bore created by the soil penetrating portion when the soil penetrating portion is wound through the soil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A tip member is located on the helical or spiral member and the means may comprise a ledge on the tip member which has a maximum dimension which is greater than the maximum dimension of the helical or spiral member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The means may also comprise a corrugated or wavelike section of the helical or spiral member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The means may still further comprise providing the helical or spiral member with a pitch or wavelength at a portion of the helical or spiral member which is greater than the remainder of the pitch or wavelength of the helical or spiral member so as to create a spring effect at the portion of greater pitch or wavelength so that springing or oscillating movement creates an oversizing of the bore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In another aspect the present invention is directed to a soil manipulation tool having a spiral shaped member forming a soil penetrating portion and defining an area in which a plug of soil may locate when said portion penetrates a soil mass, wherein rotation of the spiral shaped member assists it to penetrate said soil mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the tool is suitable for removing the plug of soil from the soil mass by withdrawing the tool from the soil mass after having penetrated the soil mass, the plug of soil being supported within the spiral shaped member.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> a soil manipulating tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown which has a handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a soil penetrating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The soil penetrating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed from a spiral or helical wire or rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is integral with the soil penetrating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is formed by simply bending the wire or rod from which the soil penetrating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed into an appropriate configuration to act as a handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The helical or spiral rod or wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which forms the soil penetrating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a spiral of generally constant amplitude (i.e. in the direction of arrow C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) from the end of the portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> adjacent the handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the tool. The soil penetrating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> defines a cylindrical cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> identified by the dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In order to use the tool the tool is applied against the soil with the tip end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> touching the soil and then is screw threaded into the soil so that the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> winds into the soil. Because of the helical or spiral nature of the portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> the tool can be generally easily wound into the soil to manipulate the soil which may comprise either a churning up of the soil so as to aerate it or loosen it, or removal of a plug of the soil by simply extracting the tool in linear fashion in a direction opposite to that which the tool was wound into the soil. If it is desired to leave the plug of soil in the body of the soil and not remove it the tool can be removed by rotating the tool in the opposite direction to that which was used to screw the tool into the soil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the rod or wire member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which forms the spiral or helical portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may have various different cross-sectional shapes. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the cross-sectional shape is of diamond shape. This shape is particularly advantageous for use in generally hard soils because the apexes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the diamond shape form cutting edges which facilitate cutting and penetration of the tool into the soil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a cross-section of circular configuration and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a rectangular shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment of the invention in which an abutment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the form of inverted u-shaped rod is located on the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a central hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is located on the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by passing the portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and sliding the member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> up to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include a stop <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which can be in the form of a button, dimple or the like formed on the handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to prevent movement of the abutment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> past the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. This embodiment of the invention has particular application when it is desired to churn over soil rather than remove a plug, in soil which is relatively hard. When the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is screwed into the soil continued rotation of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, because of the relatively hard nature of the soil, is merely likely to continue drawing the tool into the soil in cork screw like fashion. However, by using the abutment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, when the abutment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> abuts surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the soil continued penetration of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the soil is prevented. Thus, continued rotation of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates the spiral or helical portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> without further penetration therefore causing the soil at the periphery of the cylindrical cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be churned up or broken up by movement of the wire or rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the soil upon rotation of the tool. The churning up of the soil therefore facilitates aeration of the soil or general loosening of hard and compacted soil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In embodiments where the soil is relatively friable or soft such as the case with compost, an abutment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may not be required because the tool can be conveniently held at a particular position after penetrating the compost and rotated without further penetration thereby aerating the compost if required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The tool described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> also has application in removing plugs of composting material from a compost container. In compost containers which have a bottom and which can be difficult to empty, the composted material can be removed from the container by simply screwing the tool described in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> into the composted material so that a plug of the composted material forms in the cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and then extracting the tool in linear fashion in a direction opposite to that of penetration. This will cause a plug of the composted material which is located in the cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be withdrawn from the composted mass. The plug can therefore be emptied into a bucket or container for transport to a location where it is used or, if the bin is at the location where the compost is to be used, the compost material can be simply shaken from the tool and dropped on the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a still further embodiment of the invention in which like reference numerals indicate like parts to those described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment of the invention a blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is located at one of the spirals of the spiral wire or rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which forms the soil penetrating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> the blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends across the cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> defined by the spiral or helical portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be located across any one of the spirals which form the portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> but most preferably is located across one of the spirals at about the mid point of the portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> between the tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of the invention has particular application in digging holes into which small plants or seedlings are to be planted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment of the invention the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is wound into the soil in the same manner as previously described. When the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been wound into the soil to a sufficient depth to provide a hole of the required size the tool is rotated in that position. If the soil is particularly hard the abutment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> can be utilised in this embodiment of the invention. In view of the location of the blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> across the spiral which forms the portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, if an abutment member is required, the abutment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be located permanently in place between the handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at manufacture. Continued rotation of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, when it is in the soil will cause the soil in the vicinity of the blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> across the entire diameter of the cylindrical cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, to be loosened by cutting action of the blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as the blade rotates at that one position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> when the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is removed from the surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the soil by withdrawing it in the direction of arrow B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is left in the soil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be provided with loosened soil <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by unscrewing the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> instead of withdrawing it in the direction of arrow B. The loosened soil <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided by the soil being loosened by the part of the penetrating portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> below the blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotated in the hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The soil above the blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is removed as a plug upon extraction of the tool in the direction of arrow B and is identified by reference numeral S in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> within the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, a hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed which has loosened soil at the bottom which is ideal for location of a plant to facilitate establishment of the root system of the plant in the loosened soil. Thus, according to this embodiment of the invention the hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be easily formed and provided with loosened soil generally in the one action of screwing the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the soil and then extracting the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to remove the plug S and leave the hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the loosened soil <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Because of the location of the blade <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> across the cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the blade will act to hold the soil above the blade within the cavity as the tool is unwound rather than simply leaving the soil within the cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in situ upon rewinding of the tool. Thus, this embodiment also provides the alternative of being able to withdraw the plug of soil S by unwinding the tool from the soil should that be necessary or desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a still further embodiment of the invention in which the rod or wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is hollow and provided with an inlet opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an outlet opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> adjacent tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. According to this embodiment of the invention liquid material such as fertilizer or water can be applied to the inlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and flow through the hollow wire or rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and exit the hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> so as to supply fertilizer to the soil during the course of manipulating the soil either to loosen it or aerate it, or during the course of removal of a plug to form a hole as in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. This embodiment has particular advantage in locating water or fertilizer beneath the root structure of a plant in the ground by screwing the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> over the plant so that the tip will be generally below the level of the root structure and then applying the fertilizer through the hollow wire or rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so that the fertilizer (or for that matter water) is located beneath the root structure to motivate the root structure to penetrate further into the soil to seek water or fertilizer. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also be provided with a reinforced tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is formed from soil material. The outlet opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is provided in the hollow portion of the wire or rid <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> adjacent the reinforced tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a modification to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in which a pump <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is applied to the inlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to facilitate the forcing of the liquid material through the hollow rod or wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and out of the outlet opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The pump <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may simply be a resilient rubber or plastic bulb or the like which is squeezed so as to apply pressure to the hollow tube <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so as to force the material in the hollow tube <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the tube and out of the outlet opening <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a modification to the tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The tip configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> may be used with a tool which has a hollow rod or wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or which is made with a soil rod or wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment the tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed on a relatively long tip member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which may have a length of up to 30 cm. The tip member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is connected to the rod or wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by welding or any suitable method and diverges outwardly to end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tip member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tip member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is provided with a shoulder or ledge <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which projects outwardly from the member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so as to have a maximum dimension in a direction radial with respect to the rod or wire member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is greater than the maximum dimension of the rod or wire member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The tip member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has particular application in soils which are relatively hard and provides a strong tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is pointed so as to enable easier penetration into the ground. Because the ledge <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is wider than the greatest dimension of the rod or wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the bore B (shown in dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) created as the tip member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> penetrates the ground, will be slightly greater than the size of the wire or rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> thereby reducing drag on the wire or rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and thereby making it easier to penetrate the entire tool into the soil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Although in the embodiment shown the tip member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is of a length in the order of 30 cm it is also possible to configure the tip member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to be much shorter of, for example, 30 mm. If it is desired to maintain the bore B, which is drilled when the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is screw threaded into the ground, as small as possible, the ledge <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is omitted so the tip member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a maximum dimension which is equal to the wire or rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and has a smooth transition into the rod or wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In a still further embodiment, as show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, part of the rod or wire member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be provided with a corrugated or wave like configuration represented by reference numeral <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. According to this embodiment, when the tool is screw threaded into the soil the corrugated or wave section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will force an oversizing of the bore B which is formed as the tool screws threads into the soil. In this embodiment the section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> provides a larger dimension as shown by arrow M in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and will create a larger bore. Once again, the part of the rod or wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is located behind the section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will therefore travel through a larger bore thereby decreasing the amount of drag and making it easier for the tool to penetrate the soil. The section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> should be provided as close to the tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as is possible so that the maximum amount of reduction in drag can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In a still further embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the oversizing can be performed by providing a pitch or wavelength of the spirals of a different magnitude. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the pitch or wavelength (shown by arrow L) of the spirals of the rod or wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is constant along the length of the soil penetrating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If the pitch or wavelength is increased (as shown by distance L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) at one of the spirals adjacent the tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> a springing or oscillating movement of the soil penetrating <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be produced as the tool is forced into the soil. This will have the tendency to make the bore created by passage of the wire or rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the soil, somewhat larger because of the slight back and forward movement of the wire on rod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as it penetrates the ground. This will also have the tendency to reduce drag because of the increased size of the bore B as the tool penetrates the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> show various other arrangements of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> the handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed from a straight rod or beam of wood or metal material and the portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a straight extension section <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> having an eye <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at its free end into which the handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inserted. The handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be secured in place by any suitable manner so that it is permanently connected to the eye <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an embodiment in which the abutment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is in the form of a disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows an abutment member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is in the form of a generally straight rod having an opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> facilitating location of the member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows an embodiment in which the handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is generally in the form a straight beam or rod formed integral with the portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows an embodiment which is similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> expect that the handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is intended to be removable from the eye <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows an embodiment in which the abutment disc <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided with a slot <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so as to facilitate location of the disc <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> onto the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is simply shows an embodiment in which the helical portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is wound in the opposite direction to that in the previous embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the invention therefore show tools which have great application in the manipulation of soil including the removal of compost from a compost bin, the aeration of compost and soil, and the formation of holes having loosened soil at the bottom for planting plants. The tool can also be used in environments close to small plants or indeed, located over small plants in order to aerate or loosen soil around the root structure of the plants. Because of the helical or spiral nature of the soil penetrating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> the penetration of the portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the soil is not likely to cut or sever the roof structure but simply wind around the root structure and loosen the soil about the root structure while at the same time supplying some aeration to the root structure. Thus, the tool can be used without fear of damaging the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention the tool is preferably of length about 40 cm to 60 cm and the rod wire member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a largest dimension in cross-section of between 3 mm and 8 mm. The amplitude of the helical spiral is approximately 20 mm to 80 mm. </paragraph>
