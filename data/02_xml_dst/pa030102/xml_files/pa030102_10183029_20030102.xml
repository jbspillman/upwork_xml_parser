<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an improvement in a disc structure suitable for a next-generation DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) with a one-sided multi-layered structure using a short-wavelength laser (blue laser or the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the present invention relates to an improvement in a disc structure that can achieve stable focus detection by suppressing interference between light reflected by the disc surface and light reflected by a (lower) information recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As prior art that can achieve stable focus detection by suppressing interference between light reflected by the disc surface and light reflected by an information recording layer, &ldquo;focusing device and optical disc apparatus using the same&rdquo; described in Japanese Patent No. 3128247 is known. With the device of this reference, interference between light reflected by the disc surface and light reflected by the information recording layer is suppressed by suppressing the half-width (&Dgr;&lgr;) of a laser light source to be equal to or smaller than a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the above device is characterized in that half-width &Dgr;&lgr; is set so that coherence length Lc determined by central wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and half-width &Dgr;&lgr; of an exit light power spectrum of a laser light source is smaller than optical path difference &Dgr;L between light which is directly reflected by the substrate surface of the disc, and light which enters the substrate, is reflected by a signal pit of the information recording layer, and leaves the substrate again. In this way, interference between light directly reflected by the disc surface, and light reflected by a recording/reproduction surface of the information recording layer is prevented, thus allowing stable focus detection/focus control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the prior art described in the above patent, if a disc to be used has a one-sided, single-layered structure, noise due to &ldquo;interference of reflected light&rdquo; does not appear in a focus signal, thus allowing satisfactory focus detection. However, if a disc to be used has a one-sided, two-layered (or multi-layered) structure, the interference suppression effect for an upper recording layer can be expected, but that for a lower recording layer cannot be expected. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the optical disc with such structure, the thickness (&Dgr;h) of the space layer is specified, so that a coherence length (Lc) determined by the central wavelength (&lgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>) and its half-width (&Dgr;&lgr;) of an exit light power spectrum of a light source, which emits a laser beam with which the first recording layer or second recording layer is irradiated, is smaller than an optical path difference (&Dgr;L) between light (u<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>) which is directly reflected by the surface of the cover layer, and light (u<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) which is transmitted through the cover layer and the space layer, is reflected by the second recording layer, and leaves the disc from the cover layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Let &lgr;<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>be the central wavelength of the laser beam, &Dgr;&lgr; be the half-width of the wavelength of the laser beam, n<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>be the refractive index of the space layer, NA be the numerical aperture of an objective lens used to focus the laser beam on the lower recording layer or upper recording layer, &Dgr;h be the thickness of the space layer, and h be the thickness of the cover layer.

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Note that relation (1) does not specify the upper limit of &Dgr;h, but the physical structure of disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is preferably designed so that thickness &Dgr;h of space layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> does not exceed thickness h (100 &mgr;m in this case) of cover layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from a practical standpoint. Likewise, thickness &Dgr;h of space layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is preferably selected to fall within, e.g., the range from 10 &mgr;m to 30 &mgr;m as not too a small but not too a large value. </paragraph>

In this case, relation (1) does not hold. However, even when &ldquo;&Dgr;&lgr;&equals;1.0 nm, &Dgr;h becomes larger than zero depending on the values of &lgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, NA, h, and the like (on a practical surface, &Dgr;h becomes larger than a value {fraction (1/10)} of h) in some cases (for example, a material with small refractive index n<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is selected, and an object lens with large numerical aperture NA is used to reduce the value of &lsqb;n<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&minus;NA<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><superscript>1/2</superscript></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Upon generalizing &ldquo;example 4&rdquo; and &ldquo;example 5&rdquo;, they can be summarized as follows: &lgr;<highlight><subscript>0&equals;</subscript></highlight>400 nm to 405 nm, &Dgr;&lgr;&equals;0.1 nm to 1.0 nm, n<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;1.61 to 1.62, NA&equals;0.85&plusmn;0.01, and h&equals;100 &mgr;m&plusmn;1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the range from 400 nm to 405 nm is selected as that of wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. This is because the transmittance of an existing objective lens abruptly drops at a wavelength of 400 nm or lower, and the influence of chromatic aberration begins to be conspicuous at a wavelength of 405 nm or higher in an existing objective lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the range from 0.1 nm to 1.0 nm is selected as that of half-width &Dgr;&lgr;. This is because this range corresponds to the variation range of half-width &Dgr;&lgr; of a currently available red laser diode for DVD. In this connection, half-width &Dgr;&lgr; of a blue laser diode which is currently easily available is around 0.5 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the range from 1.61 to 1.62 is selected as that of refractive index n<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. This is because &ldquo;relationship between refractive index n and wavelength &lgr;&rdquo; basically satisfies &ldquo;dn/d&lgr;&lt;0&rdquo;, and the range &ldquo;1.61 to 1.62&rdquo; is obtained when this relation is applied to the aforementioned wavelength range (400 nm to 405 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the range of 0.85&plusmn;0.01 is selected as that of numerical aperture NA of the objective lens. The reason why the variation width of NA is set to be &ldquo;&plusmn;0.01&rdquo; is that variations of NA of an objective lens for an existing DVD may fall within this range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the range of 100 &mgr;m&plusmn;1 &mgr;m is selected as the range of thickness h of the cover layer. This is because the thickness nonuniformity of a thin film sheet, which is prepared in advance and forms the cover layer, may fall within the range of 100 &mgr;m&plusmn;1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When optical path difference &Dgr;L is shorter than coherence length Lc, light waves interfere with each other between the surface of cover layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and lower recording layer (second recording layer: reflecting layer) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of optical disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In such case, when optical disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> suffers thickness nonuniformity in the circumferential or radial direction, or suffers thickness variations for respective manufactures, a focus error signal drifts in synchronism with rotation of optical disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> due to the influence of interference. As a result, accurate focusing control is disturbed, resulting in S/N (signal-to-noise ratio) drop of a reproduced signal and an increase in jitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> However, when two-layered disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in which thickness &Dgr;h of space layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> satisfies relation (1) (e.g., &Dgr;h&equals;10 &mgr;m to 30 &mgr;m or more), coherence length Lc given by equation (4) can be shorter than optical path difference &Dgr;L given by equation (2) (&Dgr;L&gt;Lc). Consequently, light wave interference between light u<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>reflected by the surface of cover layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and light u<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>reflected by lower recording layer (second recording layer) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of next-generation DVD disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be prevented. </paragraph>

(Since a laser beam is controlled to hit to form nearly right angles with the disc surface, it is handled as &ldquo;cos &thgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&ap;1&rdquo;. For example, even when &thgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>has a tilt of 1&deg; (at most), since cos &lsqb;1&deg;&rsqb;&ap;0.9998, &ldquo;cos &thgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&ap;1&rdquo; can be used.) </paragraph>

For this reason, even when the angle of the beam that becomes incident on the disc surface has deviated from 1&deg;, the interference prevention condition &ldquo;&Dgr;L&gt;Lc&rdquo; can be cleared.

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Since two-layered disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which satisfies relation (1) is used as next-generation DVD disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the present invention, coherence length Lc given by equation (4) can be shorter than optical path difference &Dgr;L given by equation (2). That is, an apparatus which uses disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the present invention (e.g., an apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to be described later) is free from the influence of light wave interference between light u<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>reflected by the surface of cover layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and light u<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>reflected by lower recording layer (second recording layer) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>.

In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the focus point of objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is located behind a target position (e.g., an information pit position of lower recording layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>), a focus error (&Dgr;Z) is generated in the upper right, first quadrant in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>; when the focus point of objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is located in front of the target position, a focus error (&minus;&Dgr;Z) is generated in the lower left, third quadrant in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. That is, the polarity (the sign of &Dgr;Z) and amount (the magnitude of &Dgr;Z) change depending on the direction and distance that the focus point of objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> deviates from the target position. In other words, focus error signal F which linearly changes with respect to focus direction deviation &Dgr;Z of objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> can be acquired. As a result, accurate focusing control can be made, thus preventing S/N drop of a reproduced signal and an increase in jitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> When a two-layered disc in which &Dgr;h does not satisfy relation (1) (a disc that does not conform to the present invention) is used, coherence length Lc becomes longer than optical path difference &Dgr;L. In this case, only a focus error signal (not shown) that pulsates with respect to focus direction deviation &Dgr;Z of objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is acquired, and it becomes difficult to implement stable, accurate focusing servo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram for explaining an optical disc apparatus (e.g., a next-generation DVD player or recorder) according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the optical disc apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, next-generation DVD disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is rotated by spindle motor <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> at a rotational speed of, e.g., 1350 rpm while being chucked on tapered cone <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Spindle motor <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is driven by spindle motor drive circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A recording/reproduction optical system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> has the following arrangement. That is, objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is arranged to face the surface of cover layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of next-generation DVD disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> undergoes movement control in the optical axis direction by focus coil <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and in the track width direction (disc radial direction) by tracking coil <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. At a position opposing objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, semiconductor laser diode (to be referred to as laser diode LD hereinafter) <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is arranged to be movable together with objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. This laser diode LD <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is energized by LD driver <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A laser beam emitted by laser diode LD <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is converted into a collimated beam by collimate lens <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and the collimated beam then enters polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. The laser beam emitted by laser diode LD <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> normally has an elliptic far-field pattern. If a circular pattern is required, a beam shaping prism (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) can be inserted after collimate lens <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Upon recording or reproduction, the laser beam, which has become incident on cover layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of DVD disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, is transmitted through upper recording layer (first recording layer) <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and is focused as a small beam spot on lower recording layer (second recording layer: reflecting layer) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Light reflected by lower recording layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> passes through objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in a direction opposite to incoming light, and is reflected by polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. The reflected beam enters photodetector <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> via a detection optical system including focusing lens <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Photodetector <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> comprises four photodetection elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>arranged on a single plane, as shown in, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The detection outputs from these four photodetection elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are input to amplifier array <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, which comprises a plurality of amplifiers, adder/subtractor, and the like, and generates focus error signal F, tracking error signal T, and reproduced signal S. Note that tracking error signal T can be obtained by a known push-pull method. Also, focus error signal F can be obtained by a known astigmatism method. In this astigmatism method, the outputs from those of photodetection elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> that are located on diagonal lines (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) are added, the other sum signal &lsqb;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&plus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>&rsqb; is subtracted from one sum signal &lsqb;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&plus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&rsqb;, and focus error signal F is obtained from this difference signal (&lsqb;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&plus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&rsqb;&minus;&lsqb;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&plus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d&rsqb;</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Focus error signal F and tracking error signal T output from amplifier array <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> are respectively supplied to focus coil <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and tracking coil <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> via servo controller <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. With these signals, objective lens <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> undergoes movement control in the optical axis direction and track width direction, thus focusing a laser beam on lower recording layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of DVD disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and tracking a beam spot to a target track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, reproduced signal S from amplifier array <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is input to signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, and undergoes waveform equalization and binarization processes. Although not shown, in the binarization process, the reproduced signal that has undergone waveform equalization is supplied to a PLL (phase locked loop circuit) and data identification circuit, thus extracting channel clocks as basic clocks upon recording information on DVD disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from the reproduced signal by the PLL. By identifying &ldquo;0&rdquo; or &ldquo;1&rdquo; of the reproduced signal on the basis of the channel clocks, data identification of information recorded on DVD disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is made, thus obtaining data pulses. That is, the reproduced signal that has undergone waveform equalization is compared with an appropriate threshold value within a predetermined duration (detection window width or window width) with reference to the timings of the leading or trailing edges of the channel clocks, thus achieving data identification. The data pulses detected by signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> in this way are input to disc controller <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, and undergo format decoding, error correction, and the like. After that, the data pulses are input to MPEG2 decoder/controller <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> as a bitstream of moving picture information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> On DVD disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, data obtained by compression-encoding moving picture information according to MPEG2 are recorded as a pit pattern on lower recording layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Hence, MPEG2 decoder/controller <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> decodes (expands) the input bitstream to reproduce original moving picture information. The reproduced moving picture information is input to video signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, which converts the information into a video signal of a predetermined television format such as NTSC or the like by appending a blanking signal and the like to it. The converted video signal is output as reproduced data, and is displayed on a display (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The reproduction system has been explained. The recording system will be briefly described below. Recording data obtained by A/D-converting an NTSC video signal or the like is input to MPEG2 encoder/formatter <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The input recording data is MPEG-encoded (compressed), and is packetized in a predetermined data format to be converted into a predetermined bitstream, which is sent to disc controller <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The bitstream is then sent to LD driver <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, which converts the bitstream into a recording signal. A recording laser driving waveform corresponding to this recording signal is sent to laser diode LD <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Information is recorded on a phase-change recording layer of lower recording layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (and/or upper recording layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) by a laser beam which is modulated in correspondence with the recording laser driving waveform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, the DVD player/recorder has been exemplified as an example of an optical disc. However, the present invention can also be applied to a DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and the like used to record/reproduce programs and/or computer data, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Note that the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiments, and various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention when it is practiced. The respective embodiments may be combined as needed as long as possible, and combined effects can be obtained in such case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the embodiments include inventions of various stages, and various inventions can be extracted by appropriately combining a plurality of required constituent elements disclosed in this application. For example, even when some required constituent elements are deleted from all the required constituent elements disclosed in the embodiments, an arrangement from which those required constituent elements are deleted can be extracted as an invention if the effect of the present invention is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The present invention specifies the thickness of the space layer in terms of optics so as to prevent interference between light directly reflected by the surface of the information medium (next-generation DVD disc or the like), and light which is transmitted through the first recording layer (upper recording layer) and space layer and is reflected by the second recording layer (lower recording layer). For this reason, noise due to interference can be prevented from appearing in a focus signal, and satisfactory focus detection can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
