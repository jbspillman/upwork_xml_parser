<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is based on and hereby claims priority to German Application No. 10130926.0 filed on Jun. 27, 2001, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method for Internet-protocol-based transmission, particularly real-time transmission, of communication data, such as voice, video or multimedia data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In contemporary communication systems, many types of data are transmitted between data processing devices using the &ldquo;Internet protocol&rdquo;&mdash;IP for short. With the Internet protocol, data to be transmitted are divided up into data packets which, having each been provided with a destination address identifying a transmission destination, are transmitted to the transmission destination independently of one another. Such data packets are frequently also referred to as Internet protocol datagrams or IP datagrams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> On account of its widespread international use and on account of very low data transmission costs, the Internet protocol is also becoming increasingly important for real-time transmission of communication data. Since the Internet protocol was not designed with a view to real-time applications, however, it has one or two disadvantageous properties for real-time applications. Thus, by way of example, because the Internet protocol datagrams are transmitted independently of one another, the transmission times for the Internet protocol datagrams can fluctuate greatly. In addition, the asynchronous transmission of the Internet protocol datagrams, particularly when there is a high transmission load, means that packet collisions arise which result in delay or in entire Internet protocol datagrams being rejected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To compensate for transmission time fluctuations, Internet protocol datagrams arriving at a receiver are normally buffer-stored in a buffer, from which they are read at constant time periods. However, buffering the Internet protocol datagrams causes further delay which cannot be tolerated in the case of many real-time applications. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to specify a method for Internet-protocol-based transmission, particularly real-time transmission, of communication data which prevents transmission time fluctuations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved by a method involving a communication data stream, such as a voice, video or multimedia data stream, being transmitted within Internet protocol datagrams via a communication network. In this case, the timing of the transmission is oriented toward a timestamp which is transmitted to a transmitter of the Internet protocol datagrams. Transmission of the timestamp, which can be in the form of a time pulse or in the form of time information, for example, is preferably repeated at regular time periods. The transmitter uses the received timestamp to reserve time intervals, or groups of time intervals, whose timing is geared to this timestamp for the purpose of transmitting the Internet protocol datagrams. The Internet protocol datagrams are respectively assigned to one of the time intervals and are transmitted within the respectively associated time interval by the transmitter in line with the Internet protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The transmitter of the Internet protocol datagrams can, by way of example, be an IP telephone, an IP videophone, a personal computer or an IP application program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The individual time intervals or groups of time intervals can, to a certain extent, be regarded as different transmission channels. The explicit association of Internet protocol datagrams which are to be transmitted and transmission time intervals allows the number of datagram collisions in the communication network to be reduced considerably, which significantly reduces transmission time fluctuations for the Internet protocol datagrams. This makes it possible to provide smaller datagram buffers or frequently even to dispense with such buffers completely, which in turn significantly shortens the transmission time for the Internet protocol datagrams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that a method according to the present invention can be implemented in existing Internet protocol communication networks without substantial complexity. To receive the Internet protocol datagrams sent according to the present invention, no modifications are required on a conventional receiver of Internet protocol datagrams. The present invention can thus be used with backward compatibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is easy to implement load control for the data traffic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the timestamp can be transmitted to the transmitter via the communication network by a central timestamp source, such as a router device or a server. The timestamp can preferably be transmitted on the physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI reference model. Advantageously, the timestamp can be transmitted to a plurality of or all transmitters of Internet protocol datagrams in the communication network or in one of the subregions thereof by a central timestamp source. The transmitters receiving a timestamp can be synchronized with one another by the timestamp, as a result of which the timings of the time intervals to be reserved according to the invention in the respective transmitters are geared to one another precisely. Transmission of the timestamp makes it possible to dispense with more complex protocols, such as the &ldquo;NTP protocol&rdquo; (NTP: Network Time Protocol), for synchronizing the transmitters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another advantageous embodiment of the invention, the time intervals can be reserved at regular, preferably virtually constant, time periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one advantageous development of the invention, the transmitter can ascertain which of the time intervals are not being used for data transmission by other transmitters in the communication network. The Internet protocol datagrams to be transmitted are then assigned only to these time intervals not used elsewhere and are transmitted within these time intervals. This allows effective prevention of collisions between the Internet protocol datagrams and Internet protocol datagrams which are to be transmitted by other transmitters. In particular, it is possible to prevent forwarding network devices in the communication network, such as router devices or &ldquo;hubs&rdquo;, from encountering Internet protocol datagrams which overlap in time and for whose forwarding only a single line is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Those time intervals which are not being used for data transmission by other transmitters in the communication network can be ascertained, by way of example, on the basis of reception of an association information item which assigns reservable time intervals to the transmitters. As an alternative to this, the transmitter can ask the other transmitters for unused time intervals or can negotiate splitting of the time intervals with the other transmitters. In accordance with another variant, the transmitter can also monitor the datagram traffic in the communication network and can in this way ascertain free, reservable time intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one advantageous embodiment of the invention, other Internet protocol datagrams&mdash;particularly for transporting non-real-time data&mdash;outside the reserved time intervals are transmitted asynchronously, that is to say without prescribing a precise transmission time. The total available data transmission time is thus split, by reserving the time intervals, to a certain extent into a reserved, synchronous part for transmitting the communication data stream and an asynchronous part outside the reserved time intervals for transmitting non-real-time data, for example control or signaling data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Preferably, reserved and unreserved time intervals can alternate at prescribed time periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The share of the time intervals to be reserved in the total available data transmission time can be varied according to requirements, for example depending on the share of real-time data in the total data transmission volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In particular, a time split information item prescribing the share of the time intervals to be reserved can be transmitted to the transmitter with the timestamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another advantageous development of the invention, initialization, e.g. of the transmitter, of a receiver or of another network device in the communication network, can involve increasing the share of the time intervals to be reserved starting from zero. This means that, to begin with, no time intervals are reserved and hence all data to be transmitted are initially transmitted asynchronously. In this phase, data transmission is based entirely on the conventional, asynchronous Internet protocol. A transmitter of Internet protocol datagrams in accordance with the invention can thus first ascertain whether a method according to the present invention is supported in the communication network, and if it is, can start to reserve time intervals. If, by contrast, the transmitter does not identify any support, for example because no timestamp is received, the transmitter can dispense with reserving time intervals. This means that a transmitter in accordance with the invention can also be integrated with backward compatibility into conventional communication networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another advantageous development of the invention, the transmitter can reserve a further time interval whose timing is geared to the received timestamp, or a further succession of time intervals, for a further communication protocol. The further communication protocol implemented can preferably be a relatively simple protocol which requires less control and administration data to be transmitted with the user data than in the case of the Internet protocol. In particular, the further communication protocol can involve expressing an address, control or channel information item using the relative position of a data packet in the further time interval. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic illustration of an Internet-protocol-based communication network comprising a local area network LAN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a local area network LAN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a wide area network WAN, such as the Internet, as subnetworks. The subnetworks LAN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, LAN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and WAN are coupled to one another via a router device ROU which is used to switch Internet protocol datagrams, called IP datagrams below, between the individual subnetworks LAN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, LAN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and WAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In addition, an Internet-protocol-based communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is coupled to the local area network LAN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and an Internet-protocol-based communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is coupled to the local area network LAN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The communication terminals IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can, by way of example, be in the form of IP telephones, IP videophones, personal computers or any other transmitters of communication data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention involves the router device ROU transmitting a timestamp ZM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the local area network LAN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and via the local area network LAN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The timestamp ZM can, by way of example, be produced by a time pulse or a time statement. Preferably, the timestamp ZM is transmitted on the physical layer, that is to say layer 1 of the OSI reference model, in order to ensure particularly precise synchronization. The timestamp ZM can be used to synchronize the communication terminals IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with one another by gearing the timing of their clock generators (not shown) or real-time clocks (not shown) to the received timestamp ZM. The received timestamp ZM can also additionally be used to display the time of day on a display on the communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It is thus possible to dispense with separate transmission of time information using a complex synchronization protocol, such as the NTP protocol (Network Time Protocol). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one alternative embodiment of the invention, the timestamp ZM can be transmitted rather than by the router device ROU also by another network device, such as a &ldquo;hub&rdquo;, a server, etc., centrally to the coupled communication terminals, in this case IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, or to any other network devices which need to be synchronized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the present exemplary embodiment, the communication terminals IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmit a respective communication data stream to the wide area network WAN in real time. Besides the respective communication data stream, which can comprise voice, video or multimedia data, for example, the communication terminals IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also transmit non-real-time data, such as signaling, control or file data, to the wide area network WAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The communication data stream coming from the communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transmitted within IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which have been provided with a destination address and are transmitted to the wide area network WAN via the local area network LAN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the router device ROU. Correspondingly, the non-real-time data coming from the communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are transmitted to the wide area network WAN within IP datagrams S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, respectively provided with a destination address, via the local area network LAN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the router device ROU. In a similar manner, the communication data stream coming from the communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is transmitted within IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the non-real-time data coming from IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are transmitted within IP datagrams S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the wide area network WAN via the local area network LAN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the router device ROU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, transmission of the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> containing real-time communication data is based on a prescribed time frame structure. The prescribed time frame structure means that IP datagrams containing real-time data are no longer transmitted asynchronously, as in conventional IP-based communication networks, but rather within time intervals reserved specifically for this purpose, that is to say synchronously to a certain extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example of such a time frame structure in a schematic representation. The start of a respective time frame is marked by the reception of the timestamp ZM. Subsequently, reserved time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and unreserved time intervals NRZI alternate until a timestamp ZM initiating the next time frame is received again. In the present exemplary embodiment, the timestamp ZM is first followed by three adjacent time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which have been reserved for IP datagrams containing real-time data. Immediately afterwards comes an unreserved time interval NRZI. The time interval group comprising three reserved time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and one unreserved time interval NRZI is then repeated at regular time periods until the next timestamp ZM is received. A standard value, which is advantageous for many applications, for the length of time of a time interval group is approximately 20 ms. Preferably, the boundary between reserved and unreserved time intervals is variable. For the purpose of continuously synchronizing the time frames of the communication terminals IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the timestamps ZM are transmitted at regular, preferably virtually constant, time periods, for example of 1 s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the reserved time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are associated with different transmission channels on the basis of their relative position in their respective time interval group. Thus, the time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> heading a respective time interval group form a first transmission channel, the time intervals K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in second position form a second transmission channel, and the time intervals K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in third place form a third transmission channel. The individual transmission channels can, to a certain extent, be regarded as time-division multiplex channels which, in accordance with the invention, have been embedded into the asynchronous concept of the Internet protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the text below, the transmission channels are respectively denoted by the same reference symbols as the respectively associated time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for reasons of clarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For real-time transmission of a communication data stream, one or more transmission channels K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are reserved for the communication data stream. To this end, each IP datagram in the communication data stream is exclusively assigned a respective time interval for the reserved transmission channel(s), within which time interval the respective IP datagram is transmitted. To transmit an IP datagram containing communication data precisely within its associated time interval, this IP datagram may need to be delayed up to the start of the associated time interval. The relative instant of transmission for an IP datagram within a time interval group can&mdash;provided that the reserved time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are of the same length&mdash;be ascertained by multiplying the length of a time interval K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by a transmission channel number starting at zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a schematic illustration showing the timing of the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, coming from the communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, with respect to the prescribed time frame structure. For transmitting the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> containing the real-time data, the transmission channels K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have been reserved, in which the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are transmitted to the router device ROU. For the IP datagrams S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> containing non-real-time data, no specific transmission channel has been reserved, which means that the IP datagram S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the router device ROU within the unreserved time interval NRZI asynchronously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In a similar manner, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows, schematically, the timing of the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, coming from the communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, with respect to the prescribed time frame structure. For the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> containing real-time data, the second transmission channel, that is to say the time interval K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, has been reserved for transmission. By contrast, for the IP datagrams S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> containing non-real-time data, no specific time interval has been reserved, which means that the IP datagrams S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are transmitted to the router device ROU within the unreserved time intervals NRZI. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the IP datagrams S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are transmitted within the unreserved time intervals NRZI asynchronously, that is to say without particular timing relative to the time interval boundaries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The association of the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the nonoverlapping time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prevents the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are to be forwarded to the wide area network WAN by the router device ROU via the same line from colliding with one another in terms of time. The result of a time collision between IP datagrams arriving at the router device ROU would be that at least one of these IP datagrams would be rejected or at least delayed until the forwarding line became free. However, this would result in delay time fluctuations which are difficult to foresee and which would have an adverse effect on the real-time response of the transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The communication data streams are assigned to the transmission channels K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> such that only one of the communication terminals IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> ever transmits on a respective transmission channel K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Appropriate temporary reservation of a transmission channel K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for a respective communication terminal, in this case IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, can be effected, by way of example, by transmitting a reservation or association information item to the communication terminals IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The reservation or association information item can preferably be transmitted by a central network device. As an alternative to this, the communication terminals IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can negotiate among one another&mdash;by interchanging appropriate messages&mdash;which transmission channels or time intervals are reserved or can be reserved by which communication terminal, in this case IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In accordance with another embodiment of the method, a communication terminal IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can ascertain a free transmission channel by observing the network data traffic itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The association of the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> containing real-time data with nonoverlapping time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> prevents IP datagram collisions at least for real-time data streams. By contrast, it is entirely possible for the IP datagrams, in this case S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, transmitted asynchronously in the nonexclusively reserved time intervals NRZI to collide in the router device ROU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is a schematic illustration showing the timing of the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> forwarded to the wide area network WAN by the router device ROU with respect to the prescribed time frame structure. Since the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have arrived at the router device ROU in reserved time intervals which do not overlap in terms of time, the router device ROU is able to forward the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the wide area network WAN in the order and with the timing in/with which they arrived. The IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can generally be forwarded to the wide area network WAN with little, but virtually constant, delay and, in particular, without substantial delay time fluctuations, caused by collision, in adjacent time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one method variant, the router device ROU&mdash;or another network device&mdash;can convert IP datagrams arriving via particular transmission channels to other transmission channels, i.e. to other reserved time intervals, in order to forward them. Conversion can preferably be effected such that the resultant delays respectively have a virtually constant channel-specific value for each of the converted transmission channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Unlike the IP datagrams D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in the present exemplary embodiment, the asynchronously transmitted IP datagram S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> arrives at the router device ROU virtually simultaneously in one of the asynchronously transmitted IP datagrams S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For the purpose of forwarding to the wide area network WAN, one of these IP datagrams, in this case S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, therefore needs to be delayed by the router device ROU until the next transmission opportunity. In the present exemplary embodiment, the IP datagram S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> cannot be transmitted until in the unreserved time interval NRZI of the next time interval group. Since the IP datagram S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> contains non-real-time data, the delay which arises can generally be tolerated, however. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The splitting of the time frame into reserved time intervals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for synchronous transmission of real-time data and unreserved time intervals NRZI for asynchronous transmission of non-real-time data can advantageously be matched to the respectively current data transmission volume of real-time and non-real-time data. Thus, by way of example, if the transmission volume of the real-time data predominates, the share of the time intervals to be reserved in the total available data transmission time can be enlarged as appropriate. Similarly, for a small share of real-time data which are to be transmitted, the share of the time intervals to be reserved can be reduced as appropriate. To adjust the share of the time intervals to be reserved, it is possible to vary their number or their length, for example. The share of the time intervals to be reserved can, by way of example, be stipulated using a time split information item which can be transmitted with the timestamp ZM. If, in the extreme case, nothing but non-real-time data are to be transmitted, the total available data transmission time can be released for conventional asynchronous transmission of IP datagrams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The reservation and assignment or allocation of the transmission time intervals for IP datagrams can preferably be implemented in the form of a novel &ldquo;quality of service function&rdquo; (QoS function) in the communication network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> On account of the reservation of time intervals for transmitting real-time data, a method according to the present invention, in contrast to conventional IP-based transmission methods, no longer allows a respective transmission time for IP datagrams to be selected arbitrarily, but rather limits the transmission time to prescribed time intervals, in this case K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and NRZI. By contrast, a receiver of IP datagrams transmitted in accordance with the invention requires no implementation changes with respect to the conventional Internet protocol. Hence, communication devices, in this case IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which transmit IP datagrams according to the present invention can also be operated in conventional, asynchronous IP-based communication networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The variable splitting of the total available data transmission time into reserved and unreserved time intervals permits simple initialization of a method according to the present invention which adjusts itself to suit different network environments: in this context, at the start of initialization, the transmitter operating according to the present invention initially reserves no time interval for transmitting real-time data, which means that the total data transmission time is initially available for conventional, asynchronous transmission. During this time, the transmitters, in this case IPT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IPT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, try to receive a timestamp ZM. If no such timestamp is received, no time intervals are reserved for transmitting real-time data. If, by contrast, such a timestamp ZM is received by a transmitter, the transmitter gears the timing of a time frame to the received timestamp ZM and reserves prescribable time intervals of the time frame, in accordance with the invention, for transmitting real-time data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to preferred embodiments thereof and examples, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
