<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a CCD sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An apparatus capable of acquiring two-dimensional information by employing a CCD is known from, for instance, European Patent Publication EP-0881486 entitled &ldquo;Method For Measuring Physical Phenomenon, or Chemical Phenomenon, and Equipment Thereof&rdquo;. As a sensor used in this measuring apparatus, such a CCD sensor is employed which is arranged by a plurality of physical/chemical sensors (unit sensors) sensible to physical/chemical phenomena, and also, a plurality of CCDs which transfer electric signal charges produced from these plural unit sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a diagram for schematically indicating a structure of an upper surface of a CCD sensor which measures, for example, a two-dimensional distributing condition of pH. In this drawing, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates a CCD sensor. This CCD sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is constituted by a plurality of unit elements (unit sensors) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sensible to hydrogen ions. While the upper surfaces of the respective unit elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are covered by pH responsive films capable of sensing (responding) with respect to hydrogen ions corresponding to a measuring object, potentials are produced at boundary surfaces between the pH response film and a liquid in response to an amount of hydrogen-ion concentration, and a magnitude (namely, pH) of the hydrogen ion concentration is converted into an electric charge signal by utilizing a change of this potential. While, for example, 10 pieces of these unit sensors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are provided along a direction indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so as to constitute a sensor column <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for instance, 5 sets of these sensor columns <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are arrayed along a direction indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is located perpendicular to the above-described arrow <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so as to arrange the CCD sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shows a charge transfer portion for transferring electric charge signals produced in the respective unit sensors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This charge transfer portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is arrayed by a plurality of vertical CCDs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a single horizontal CCD <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, while the vertical CCDs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are arranged by a plurality of CCDs. Also, reference numeral <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> represents a signal output portion for outputting a signal derived from the horizontal CCD <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> represents a diffusion portion of the signal output portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustratively shows a basic structure of the above-explained CCD sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this drawing, reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> indicates a semiconductor substrate made of, for instance, p type Si (silicon), the thickness of which is selected to be on the order of 500 micrometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A channel stopper <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a charge supplying portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a charge injection control portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a sensor portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> functioning as a charge converting portion, a barrier portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a CCD <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which constitutes the charge transfer portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a floating diffusion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a reset gate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a reset drain <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and an output transistor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> having an MOS structure are formed on the above-described semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Then, a single piece of unit sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is constituted by the respective members such as the charge supply portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the charge injection control portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the sensor portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the barrier portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As will be later discussed more in detail, the sensor portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> constructs such a potential well which is constituted in such a manner that a depth of this potential well is changed in response to a magnitude of hydrogen-ion concentration. Also, the signal output portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is constituted by the respective members such as the floating diffusion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the reset gate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the reset drain <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the output transistor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Now, a principle idea of measuring operations of the above-described unit sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be explained with reference to a potential diagram indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. When the measuring operation is carried out, a pulse voltage is applied to the charge supplying portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the barrier portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the reset gate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, whereas a DC voltage is applied to other electrodes except for the floating diffusion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in an MOS structure using a p type semiconductor, the following fact is normally known. That is, since a positive voltage is applied to a metal electrode of the MOS structure, a depletion layer is formed on a boundary surface between an insulating film and the semiconductor in response to this positive voltage. As a consequence, while this phenomenon is used, potential states are produced in the vicinity of the boundary surface between the semiconductor and the insulating film, as represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a state as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, the potential of the charge supplying portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is set to a high potential (namely, arrow direction is high potential), and electric charges <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are not injected into the sensor portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a state as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, since the potential of the charge supplying unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is decreased, the electric charges <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are injected into the sensor portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a state as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, since the potential of the charge supplying unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is increased, the electric charges <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which have been cut off by the charge injection control portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are stored into the sensor portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>D, since the potential of the barrier portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is increased, the electric charges <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which have been stored in the sensor portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are transferred to the floating diffusion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>E, after all of the electric charges <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the sensor portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> have been transferred to the floating diffusion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the barrier portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is closed so as to stop the flow-in operation of the charges. At this stage, the potential of the floating diffusion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is determined based upon an amount of such transferred electric charges <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, this potential is inputted to the gate portion of the output transistor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> having the MOS structure, and a drain current of this output transistor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is measured by a source follower circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a state as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>F, after the potential of the floating diffusion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been read, the reset gate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is turned ON so as to reset the potential of the floating diffusion to the potential of the reset drain <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Since this reset operation is performed, the potential state is again returned to the above-explained state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. In other words, since the operations defined from the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> to the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</cross-reference> are repeatedly carried out, the electric charges can be derived outside the MOS structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the CCD sensor having the above-described structure, phenomena occurred at a plurality of different positions can be measured at the same time. Since the magnitude of the hydrogen ion concentration is converted into the electric charges, either a one-dimensional distribution of pH or a two-dimensional distribution of pH can be easily acquired as an image by employing the charge transfer portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> constituted by a plurality of CCDs <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Furthermore, electric charges indicative of information as to plural points are stored, so that a very weak signal can be amplified. Accordingly, a very small change occurred in a phenomenon may also be firmly grasped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As previously explained, in such a case that the two-dimensional information is obtained by employing the CCD, the electric charges appeared in the detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> arranged in the two-dimensional manner are continuously carried to the diffusion portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the signal output portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and then, are converted into the voltage by this diffusion portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This voltage may be outputted outside this CCD. In such a case that a chemical amount such as ion concentration, or a physical amount such as a temperature, which are wanted to be measured, constitutes only a portion of an entire amount, and furthermore, a signal amount is small, S/N (signal-to-noise ratio) is necessarily determined based upon performance of an FET of the above-explained diffusion portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Under such a circumstance, the following idea may be conceived. That is, the areas of the respective detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be increased so as to carry a large amount of electric charges. In this case, while potential inclinations (fringe effect) at the detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are not involved, there is a limitation in increasing of the above-described areas of these detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, it is practically difficult to achieve sufficiently high S/N. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMNET </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to drawings, the present invention will be described in detail. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> indicate a CCD sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A according to an embodiment mode of the present invention. This CCD sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A of the present invention owns such a large different structure, as compared with that of the above-explained CCD sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. That is, while two sets of diffusion portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B are provided in a parallel manner to each other in a signal output portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, outputs (electric charges) of a designated detecting element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are accumulated into one diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A to output the accumulated electric charges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, reference numerals <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B indicate diffusion portions which are coupled to a diffusion portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided on the side of an output of a horizontal CCD <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, these diffusion portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B are arranged in a parallel manner to each other. One diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A constitutes a charge-accumulation diffusion portion, and the other diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B constitutes a normal charge-outputting diffusion portion. On an edge portion of each of these diffusion portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B, both a floating diffusion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A and another floating diffusion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B are formed, while reset gates <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A/<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B, reset drains <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A/<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, and output transistors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A/<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B are electrically connected to these floating diffusions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A/<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B. Then, reference numeral <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> denotes a control portion for controlling the reset gates <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B. It should be noted that symbols &ldquo;H&rdquo; and &ldquo;L&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> represent two phase electrodes used when the CCD sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A is driven in a two phase mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Next, operations of the CCD sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the above-described structure will now be explained. For instance, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is so assumed that signals derived from 4 detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> located in such a region indicated by a dot and dash line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are accumulated. Electric charges which are derived from all of these detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> including the detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the above-described region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are entered via both the vertical CCD <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the horizontal CCD <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> into the diffusion portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the signal output portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Then, the respective electric charges entered into the diffusion portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be allocated to the charge-accumulation diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and the normal charge-outputting diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B by switching magnitudes (heights) of voltages at the electrodes &ldquo;H&rdquo; and &ldquo;L&rdquo; in this diffusion portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this case, only the electric charges outputted from the four detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> located in the previously designated region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are inputted into the charge-accumulation diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, whereas electric charges outputted from all of the detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which contain the four detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> within the designated region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are inputted into the normal charge-outputting diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B except when they are transferred to the charge-accumulation diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A for accumulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Then, the electric charges derived from all of the detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which are entered into the normal charge-outputting diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B, are outputted therefrom every time the reset gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B is operated so as to produce an image signal in a similar manner to the operations of the conventional CCD sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the charge electrics derived from the four detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> located in the region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which are inputted into the charge-accumulation diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, are stored only preset times, while the floating diffusion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A connected to this charge-accumulation diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A is not reset every time. Thereafter, these electric charges are outputted from this charge-accumulation diffusion portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A so as to produce an image signal. As a result, even when the electric charges derived from the four detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> located in this region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are small, these small electric charges are integrated with each other only preset times, so that the integrated electric charges may become a large signal and the resulting S/N may be improved. As a consequence, such a specific region which is wanted to be observed can be clearly observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Then, while a total integration time of the electric charges within the set region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be properly set, and/or the area of this region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be properly increased/decreased, such a measuring operation with a wide dynamic range may be carried out without lowering the transfer efficiency in the CCD sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiment mode, the two-dimensional distribution of pH is observed by the CCD sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A. However, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment mode, but may be accomplished by that since the structure of the detecting elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is properly changed, various sorts of chemical phenomena as well as various kinds of physical phenomena may be observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As previously described, in accordance with the present invention, in the CCD sensor in which the electric charges derived from a plurality of detecting elements are outputted from the signal output portion, two diffusion portions are provided in a parallel manner to each other in the signal output portion, and the electric charges outputted from the designated detecting element are accumulated into one of these two diffusion portions so as to output the accumulated electric charges. As a consequence, even when the signal levels acquired by these designated detecting elements are low, the CCD sensor can perform the measuring operation in high precision, while the dynamic range thereof can be widened. As a result, the specific region can be displayed as the high-precision image. </paragraph>
