<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an operating system. More specifically, it relates to a system and method that can operate with different OS&apos;s (Operating System) and have both fax sending and management functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With the increase in computer popularity, people often need to use computers to solve problems either at work or at home. But there are some causes that still produce the difficulty for people to use the fax software packages. One can see the causes in the following points: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1. Existing personal computer OS&apos;s (Operating System), such as MS Windows or Linux, are complicated despite their powerful functions and designs. Moreover, user interface designs are not intuitive and simple enough. This situation scares people without any computer background because of the obstacles they meet while using these systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Fax software packages all include editing, browsing, sending, receiving, and management functions. Conventional fax software packages usually use a parallel (random) method to group the above functions together and provide them to the user. They are more complicated in operations and uses and generally assume that users have some familiarity with the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Because of the above, it is highly desirable to have a simple and convenient OS to solve these problems and to provide a WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) operating interface. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, the invention provides an auto fax sending and management system and its method. The system is based on a one-touch OS. Two objectives of the disclosed system are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 1. to use a finite number of keys as hot keys to achieve the operation of various functions so that these functions can be initiated by a single key, thus providing convenience and intuition of operation in order to increase users&apos; interest in using the computer; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> 2. to provide a method that simulates real automatic fax sending and management, so that by following the one-touch principle a user can select one of the functions to perform operations in the utility modules, thus implementing the WYSIWYG and WYDIWYG (What-You-Do-Is-What-You-Get) principles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention summarizes the above-mentioned situations occurring in practice and provides several ways to send out faxes. It systematically organizes editing, reading and sending, and simplifies the user&apos;s operations. Thus, the invention provides great help for users unfamiliar with computers. Based upon the above features, any computer in which the auto fax sending and management system is installed can facilitate fax sending. This provides extra value to computers, further promoting their sales. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The disclosed method includes the steps of initiating a one-touch OS, running the fax controlling mechanism to perform analyses, selecting a fax sending procedure through the fax controlling mechanism, preparing a fax document, receiving editing messages by the user using an editing module, prompting the user to enter a fax number and relevant information and preview them, and sending the fax through a communications module.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The invention proposes an auto fax sending and management system and method. In particular, it provides a simple and intuitive UOI (User Operating Interface) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for currently complicated OS&apos;s. The user is able to complete an operation by simply pressing a single hot key. Through a network connection, the user can use the one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to achieve fax sending and management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment is provided below to explain the feasibility of the invention. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the disclosed auto fax sending and management system processes reading, editing, and browsing of faxes using the one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Through the UOI <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, at least one work group is produced. By clicking functions in the work group, the user can perform various fax operations, such as &ldquo;EDIT FAX&rdquo;, &ldquo;READ FAX&rdquo;, and &ldquo;FAX COMMUNICATIONS&rdquo;. When the user enters a fax control mechanism <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provided by the one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the system starts a specific procedure. The fax control mechanism <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes: (1) a reading module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>; (2) an editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>; (3) a communications module <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>; and (4) an input request module <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> 1. The reading module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> displays all received fax message on the screen of the computer. The user can browse and read the messages by clicking each of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> 2. The editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> decodes received fax messages or encodes fax messages to be sent. The user can modify or edit the contents of the fax message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> 3. The communications module <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is a communications interface between the fax control mechanism and the external environment. A server containing a receiving unit <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and a sending unit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is used to receive and send the fax messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> a) The receiving unit <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> receives fax messages sent from other users and initiates the editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to decode the messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> b) The sending unit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> sends fax messages in the fax control mechanism and initiates the editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to encode the messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> 4. The input request module <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> allows the user to select contents of the fax messages to be sent using other programs. After the encoding process, this module sends out the fax through the sending unit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> refers to an OS that enables a user to complete functions provided in the work group and displayed on the UOI <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with one action. The work group is comprised of at least one function item. The one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can existent within other OS&apos;s or alone. The user can choose to switch between the different OS&apos;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can run on any computer controlled hardware platform, such as a PC (Personal Computer), an NB (Notebook), or a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). Any individual skilled in the art can make various modifications to implement the disclosed fax control mechanism <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in any electronic device that can establish communication with a network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there are two ways that a user can manipulate the UOI <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>: (1) select contents using another program (step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>) and, after processing by the input request module <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in the fax control mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, complete the fax operation event through the sending unit; (2) directly select a fax operation event through the fax control mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which includes &ldquo;EDIT FAX&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>), &ldquo;READ FAX&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>), and &ldquo;FAX COMMUNICATIONS&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>). When &ldquo;EDIT FAX&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>) is selected, the editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is initiated to edit the contents of the fax document. Afterwards, the editing module uses its encoding function to perform encoding. Finally, the sending unit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> sends out the fax document. When &ldquo;READ FAX&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>) is selected, the user browses the fax document using the reading module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and determines whether editing is necessary (step <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>). If it needs editing, the editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is then used to edit the contents of the fax document. Afterwards, the editing module uses its encoding function to perform encoding, and, finally, the sending unit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> sends out the fax document. If the fax document does not need editing, the editing module performs encoding directly, and the sending unit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> sends out the fax document. When &ldquo;FAX COMMUNICATIONS&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>) is selected, the user sends or receives fax messages through the communications module <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. For receiving faxes, the receiving unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> first receives a fax message and then the editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> decodes the message to restore the fax. For sending faxes, the editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> encodes a fax message to be sent and the sending unit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> sends out the fax message. The above-mentioned fax operation events are the most basic events of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>-<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the procedures of the main control function <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> First the one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is initiated (step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>). A fax control mechanism <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is then initiated (step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) to determine whether there is a fax document and if so to analyze the type of the fax document. After the analysis, the fax control mechanism <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> selects a fax sending procedure (step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). There are three types of fax sending procedures: (1) sending control procedure for a new fax, (2) sending control procedure for an existing fax, and (3) sending control procedure for appended contents from other applications. If the user selects the sending control procedure for a new fax, a fax document is first formed (step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>). The editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> then receives an editing message from the user. After editing, the editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> prompts the user to enter a fax number and other relevant information and generates a preview (step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). Afterwards, the editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> performs encoding on the fax message. Finally, the communications module <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> sends out the fax document (step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> After step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>-<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the procedure enters either step A or B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>-<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. If the sending control procedure for a new fax is selected, the reading module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> selects contents after step A (step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>). If the user wants to edit or modify the contents, the editing module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is utilized (step <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>), and the communications module <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> sends out the fax document (step <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>). If the user does not want to edit, then step <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is performed directly. Afterwards, another fax sending procedure is selected in step <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. If the user chooses to read other fax documents, then the procedure goes back to step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. If the user chooses to create a new fax, then step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> follows and the above-mentioned procedure for creating a new fax document is performed. If the user chooses to exit, the procedure ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> If the sending control procedure for appended contents from other applications is selected, step B is followed by the step of selecting an object to determine the fax content (step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>). After selection, the communications module <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> sends out the fax document (step <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>). Another fax sending procedure is selected in step <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. If the user chooses to add other objects in the fax document, then step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is repeated. If the user wants to create a new fax document, then step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is performed. If the user chooses to exit, then the procedure ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The files of the above-mentioned objects can be extracted from the texts of graphs in a text editor or a graph browser and copied to the fax document. The user can perform all these functions with a single action through the fax control mechanism of the one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the current embodiment, the &ldquo;single action&rdquo; allowed for by the one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> means that the user needs only to press one key on the keyboard according to a selection menu to enter his request. Any key on the keyboard can be set to complete this kind of action. The keys include the number keys 0&tilde;9, the letter keys A&tilde;Z, the function keys F1&tilde;F12 and special keys ESC, TAB, PgUp, END, etc. Aside from the keyboard, the single action request input can be accomplished using a mouse or other controllers, such as a digital touch-control panel or voice recognition system. That is, any basic computer input device can be used to provide one-touch control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
