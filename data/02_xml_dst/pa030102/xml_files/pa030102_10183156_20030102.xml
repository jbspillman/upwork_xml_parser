<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device and a method for manufacturing the same. More specifically, the present invention relates to highly-integrating technology for memory cells of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, the miniaturization and high-integration of semiconductor memory devices, especially those of DRAMs, are making remarkable progress. In accordance with this, more and more memory cells with very limited areas have been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the past, DRAMs have been miniaturized and integrated, without changing the planar structure of the cell transistors of memory cells. For this reason, the cell transistors have become very hard to design. To be more specific, planar type cell transistors must suppress a short channel effect and have an improved retention characteristic, but these two requirements are hard to satisfy simultaneously when they are miniaturized. In effect, further improvement cannot be expected on this matter. Nevertheless, there is a requirement that the cell areas be reduced further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</cross-reference> show the cell structure of a conventional DRAM. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference> is a plan view showing the cell layout of an 8F2 type, for example, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference> is a sectional view taken along line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in these Figures, the occupation area of one memory cell is determined by planar type cell transistor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, one bit line contact (CB) <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> shaped by two cells, and an element isolation region <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> denotes an active area (AA), numeral <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> denotes a p-type silicon substrate, numeral <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> denotes a word line, numeral <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> denotes an SiN film, numeral <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> denotes an interlayer film, numeral <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> denotes a capacitor contact (storage node contact &lsqb;CN&rsqb;), and numeral <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> denotes a bit line (BL). Reference numeral <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> denotes a cell capacitor including a storage electrode (SN) <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a capacitor dielectric film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a plate electrode (PL) <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Let us assume that a minimum working dimension is F and that a gate electrode (word line (WL)) <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a diffusion layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(which is to function as a source or drain) have sides that are designed based on F. In this case, the minimum occupation area of a memory cell is 8F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(the length is 2F, and the width is 4F). As can be seen from this, the miniaturization and integration of a DRAM wherein each memory cell includes one transistor and one capacitor have made progress based on the 8F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>type cell layout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the planar type cell transistor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, however, the gate length decreases in accordance with a decrease in the cell area, and the short channel effect is hard therefore to suppress. To effectively suppress the short channel effect, a leak between depletion layers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>should be reduced, and this is attained by increasing the boron concentration of a channel section (in the case where a substrate <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is a p-type). On the other hands, it is required that the retention characteristic be further improved since the retention characteristic plays an important role in determining the performance of a DRAM. To improve the retention characteristic, the junction leak at the capacitor side, which adversely affects the retention characteristic, must be reduced. This is attained by decreasing the boron concentration of the channel section in the neighborhood of the capacitor-side junction (in the case where the substrate is a p-type). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the DRAM, one requirement is attained by increasing the impurity concentration in the channel section of a cell, and another requirement is attained by decreasing the same impurity concentration. In other words, these requirements are in trade-off relationships in terms of the impurity concentration of the channel section. Moreover, the recent severe cost competition requires that the cell area be further reduced and the chips (DRAM) be further miniaturized and integrated. However, in the 8F2 type cell layout shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A, the cell area is already that of the theoretical limitation (i.e., the cell area is none other than 8F<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). Under the circumstances, the required reduction in the cell areas cannot be attained, and the further miniaturization and integration of chips cannot be met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As described above, further reduction in the size of cell areas and further miniaturization and integration of chips are required in the conventional art. These requirements, however, cannot be met since the suppression of the short channel effect of a cell transistor and the improvement of the retention characteristic are hard to satisfy simultaneously in the case of the 8F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>type cell layout. </paragraph>

The gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is rectangular and looks like having a substantially &ldquo;I&rdquo;-shaped surface when viewed from above, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In conjunction with the diffusion regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> described above, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forms a vertical cell transistor, wherein the side surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>functions as a channel section. The gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected to a corresponding word line (WL) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, bit line contacts (CB) <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are connected at one end to either diffusion layer regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. They are connected to diffusion layer regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, for example. At the other end, the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are connected to corresponding bit lines (BL) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. These bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are arranged to be substantially orthogonal to the word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have their upper surfaces covered with silicon nitride films <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and have their side surfaces covered with silicon nitride films <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A silicon oxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed in each trench <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby providing element isolation <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The diffusion layer regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>that are not connected to the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, for example diffusion layer regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, are connected to one-end portions of capacitor contacts (storage node contacts CN). The capacitor contacts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are arranged utilizing the spaces between the word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The other-end portions of the capacitor contacts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are connected to cell capacitors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> formed on interlayer films <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Each of the cell capacitors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a storage electrode (lower capacitor electrode) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a capacitor dielectric film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and a plate electrode (upper capacitor electrode PL) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, memory cells are arranged at the intersections between the word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In other words, the first embodiment provides a layout structure for cross-point type cells. Each memory cell includes a vertical cell transistor and a cell capacitor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (that is, a memory cell is made up of one transistor and one capacitor). Assuming that the minimum working dimension of the memory cells is F, the minimum occupation area is 4F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>per cell (the pitch of the word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is 2F, and the pitch of the bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is 2F). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A description will now be given of a process for manufacturing the DRAM of the first embodiment, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C and FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 4A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A are sectional views taken along line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B, 4B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B are sectional views taken along line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C, 4C</cross-reference>, SC, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C are sectional views showing peripheral regions (peripheral circuit regions) of array regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, a Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a Pad nitride film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a second Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are sequentially deposited on the p-type silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) in the order mentioned. Subsequently, a resist pattern (not shown) used for forming silicon columns <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is worked by photolithography. The second Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the Pad nitride film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are sequentially worked by RIE (Reactive Ion Etching), using the resist pattern as a mask. After the resist pattern is removed, the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is etched by RIE, using the second Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the Pad nitride film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as a mask. By this etching, shallow first trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed in the array regions, thereby forming the silicon columns <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> described above. Then, the side surfaces of the silicon columns <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are oxidized, thereby forming oxide films <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which serve as the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the bottom portions (silicon pedestals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) of the first trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are doped with ions by oblique ion implantation, thereby forming diffusion layer regions (first diffusion layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. If this ion implantation degrades the quality of the oxide films <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, these oxide films <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are removed and new oxide films <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed instead. Then, a polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is deposited over the entire surface of the resultant structure. The polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is recessed by CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) in such a manner that it is left inside the shallow first trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. At the time, the second Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is used as a stopper. Thereafter, as can be seen from the film structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, the second Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is selectively etched out in the peripheral regions of the array regions by photolithography and wet etch processing. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, a resist pattern (PR) <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> used for forming an active region is worked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, the Pad nitride film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is patterned in the peripheral regions of the array regions. This patterning is executed under the SiN-RIE etching condition, using the resist pattern <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as a mask. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, the polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is patterned in the array regions after the etching condition is changed to Poly-RIE. At the time, the resist pattern <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the second Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are used as a mask (critical mask). As a result, vertical-type gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, whose lower portions are similar in shape to the bottom portions (silicon pedestals) of the first trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, are formed on the bottom portions of the first trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</cross-reference>, the Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the oxide films <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are worked or removed by RIE. After the resist pattern <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is removed, the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is etched under the Si-RIE etching condition in such a manner that second trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(which are deep and used for element isolation) and trenches <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are formed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>B, those portions of the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which would be adjacent to the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (i.e. portions other than the one-side surface portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). A silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is deposited over the entire surface of the resultant structure by CVD, and is then recessed in such a manner that it is left only in the trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C, element isolation <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime; is completed by removing the second Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, recessing the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and removing the Pad nitride film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. What should be noted here is that element isolation <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime; is attained simultaneously in both the array regions and their peripheral regions and the steps required can be simplified, accordingly. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, an N-well region <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and a P-well region <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are formed in the peripheral regions of the array regions by executing ion implantation through the use of the Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. After the Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is removed, a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, which is an oxide film, is formed. Of this oxide film, those portions which are located on the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are removed by photolithography and wet etch processing. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5C</cross-reference>, a second polycrystalline film and a silicide film (or a metal film), which are to serve as word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the array regions and gate electrodes (GC) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the peripheral regions, are deposited by CVD. The resultant structure is overlaid with a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which are to serve as a cap) by CVD. Gates (word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and gate electrodes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) are worked by photolithography and RIE. Subsequently, silicon nitride films <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, serving as spacers, are deposited by CVD, and the deposited silicon nitride films <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are worked by CVD in such a manner that their portions located on the side wall are left. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C, ion implantation is executed in such a manner that diffusion layer regions (second diffusion layers) are formed in the upper portions of the silicon columns <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the array regions, and that diffusion regions <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> serving as sources or drains of transistors are formed in the peripheral regions. In the array regions, therefore, the vertical-type gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the diffusion layer regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>define vertical-type cell transistors, wherein one-side portions of the silicon columns <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> function as channel sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> After an interlayer film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed, contact holes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are formed in the array regions. The contact holes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>reach the diffusion layer regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>formed in the silicon pedestals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. Then, in order to ensure reliable insulation between the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the silicon columns <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (or gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>), spacers (not shown) made of silicon nitride films are formed inside the contact holes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A barrier metal film and a tungsten film are deposited over the resultant structure, and the bit contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are completed by working them by CMP. The bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are formed in self-alignment with the word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Next, a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which is later used as a bit line material and a cap, is deposited, for example, by CVD, and bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed by working the deposited silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by photolithography and RIE. In addition, a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is later used as spacers of the bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is deposited, for example, by CVD, and the deposited silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is worked by RIE in such a manner that it is left on the side wall portions. As shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, an interlayer film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is deposited in the array regions, and contact holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the capacitor contacts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are formed. A barrier metal film and a tungsten film are further deposited, and the deposited films are worked by CMP, thereby completing the capacitor contacts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The capacitor contacts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are formed in self-alignment with the word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Next, storage electrodes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a cylinder structure, for example, are formed on the capacitor contacts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The storage electrodes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>need not be of cylinder structure; they may be of any structure including a concave structure or a pedestal structure. When the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed (alternatively, before or after they are formed), contacts <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> leading to the diffusion layers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, wiring layers (MO) <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> leading to the contacts <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and caps <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and spacers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for the wiring layers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are formed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the array regions, a capacitor dielectric film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a plate electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, both for the cell capacitors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, are deposited and worked, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>. Thereafter, in the peripheral regions of the array regions, wiring layer-forming steps, such as the steps of forming wiring vias (C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and wiring layers (M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, are executed with respect to the interlayer film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. In this manner, a DRAM (DRAM cell) having such a cell structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As described above, the DRAM of the above embodiment employs vertical-type cell transistors. In other words, the cell transistors are a vertical type in a layout structure for cross-point type cells. This structure enables controlling the boron concentration in the channel section and the boron concentration in the junction at the capacitor side independently of each other. Hence, the suppression of the short channel effect and the improvement of a retention characteristic are attained, and yet the cell layout can be determined based on 4F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In particular, the suppression of the short channel effect of a transistor and the improvement of the retention characteristic are attained at the same time, and the adoption of the vertical-type gate electrodes enables efficient use of the space. Hence, the cell area can be significantly reduced, and the life of the DRAM cells can be remarkably lengthened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It should be also noted that the cell capacitors can be formed using the conventionally known technology. This ensures a high degree of flatness of the bit lines, and a high manufacturing yield is attained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> show the cell structure of a DRAM according to the second embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a plan view showing the cell layout, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> are sectional views taken along lines <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, according to the second embodiment, the vertical-type gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; of the vertical cell transistors are formed in self-alignment with the silicon pedestals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (i.e., with the shallow first trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). In this point, the second embodiment differs greatly from the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, a polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is worked by isotropic etching. This etching allows the vertical-type gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; to be formed in self-alignment with the silicon pedestals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. That is, unlike the first embodiment, the second embodiment eliminates the need to employ such a mask (critical mask) as required for forming gates (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the pitch of bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is increased from 2F to 3F (F: minimum working dimension) so as to ensure reliable insulation between bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the vertical-type gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime;. The minimum occupation area is 6F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>per cell (the pitch of word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is 2F). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, each vertical-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; looks like having a substantially &ldquo;L&rdquo;-shaped surface when viewed from above. It extends along the adjoining side surfaces of one corner of a silicon column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and surrounds part of the silicon column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the section taken along line <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, however, the vertical-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; does not exist, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. This structure prevents the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> from short-circuiting, and yet increases the gate width of each vertical-type cell transistor. As compared to the first embodiment, the vertical-type cell transistors of the second embodiment provide a high driving power and are therefore suitable for a high-speed operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As described above, the second embodiment makes good use of corners of silicon columns so as to reduce the substrate bias effect of the vertical-type cell transistors. As a result, the vertical-type cell transistors are improved in the slope characteristic of sub-threshold leak and enable a high-speed operation on low voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> To form vertical-type gate electrodes, shallow first trench <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are filled with a polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>), and side etching is executed by CDE (chemical dry etching), without the resist pattern <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> being removed. In this manner, the vertical-type gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed in self-alignment with the corresponding silicon pedestals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>. As compared to the vertical-type gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment, the vertical-type gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; of the second embodiment are slim. To be more specific, the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; of the second embodiment are reduced in terms of the thickness as measured in the section taken along line <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and are smaller than the bottom portions of the first trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thereafter, the Pad oxide film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the oxide film <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are removed by RIE. After the resist pattern <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is removed, the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is etched under the Si-RIE etching condition. In this manner, deep second trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>used for element isolation in the array regions and trenches <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> used for element isolation in the peripheral regions are formed. Then, a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> used for element isolation is deposited by CVD, and the deposited film is recessed by CMP, thereby providing element isolation <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> By executing the subsequent steps, which are similar to those of the first embodiment, a DRAM shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B is completed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference> show the cell structure of a DRAM according to the third embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a plan view showing the cell layout, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference> are sectional views taken along lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, respectively. The pitch of word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is 2F, and the pitch of bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; is 1F. Hence, the minimum occupation area is 2F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>per cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the case of the third embodiment, bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; are linear wiring layers made of diffusion regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>formed in the bottoms of trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (in the embodiment, in the bottoms of shallow first trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10, 11A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B. In this point, the third embodiment differs greatly from the first and second embodiments. In other words, the bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> described above in relation to the first and second embodiments are diffusion layer regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in the DRAM of the third embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, the contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> between the bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the diffusion layer regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>need not be located inside cells. This being so, the silicon columns <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the vertical-type gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&Prime; are prevented from short-circuiting to the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. It should be noted in particular that the position of the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is hard to control in the depth direction. If the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are at a too shallow or deep position, their contact performance may be adversely affected. Since this problem does not occur, the manufacturing yield is high, and the steps required can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, each vertical-type gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&Prime; may be shaped substantially in the form of &ldquo;L&rdquo;, as in the second embodiment. Where each gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&Prime; is shaped in this manner, it extends along the adjoining side surfaces of one corner of a silicon column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and surrounds part of that silicon column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This structure increases the gate width of each vertical-type cell transistor. As compared to the first embodiment, the vertical-type cell transistors of the third embodiment provide a high driving power and are therefore suitable for a high-speed operation. The third embodiment makes good use of corners of silicon columns <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so as to reduce the substrate bias effect of the vertical-type cell transistors. As a result, the vertical-type cell transistors are improved in the slope characteristic of sub-threshold leak and enable a high-speed operation on low voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A description will be given as to how the bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; are manufactured. First of all, the side surfaces of the silicon columns <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are oxidized, so as to form oxide layers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>functioning as gate insulating films <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>). Subsequently, diffusion layer regions (first impurity layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>are formed by vertical ion implantation (in place of oblique ion implantation). As a result, bit lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;, which serve as diffusion layer regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>as well, are formed in the bottom regions (silicon pedestals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) of the shallow first trenches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, those portions of the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which would be adjacent to the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (i.e. portions other than the one-side surface portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the silicon column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) are removed by photolithography and Poly-RIE etching, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. This step is omitted in the case of the third embodiment. However, bit line contacts connected to sense amplifiers are formed in the peripheral regions of the array regions, by executing a step similar to that of the first embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> By executing the subsequent steps, which are substantially similar to those of the first embodiment, a DRAM shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10, 11A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Where a layout structure for cross-point type cells is adopted, the noise immunity may be adversely affected, lowering the margin of a sensing operation. A number of methods are available to prevent this problem (i.e., there are some measures that can be taken to reduce noise). By adopting such methods in combination with the present invention, a reliable operation is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> (Fourth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram illustrating a multi-layered bit line system, which is an example of a noise-reducing measure. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, two wiring layers (e.g., bit lines BL and /BL) are twisted at a number of positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, double-layered bit lines BL and /BL are formed, and they are twisted at one or more positions. This structure is effective in canceling noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Since the DRAM of the fourth embodiment adopts the noise-reducing measure described above, a very stable operation is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a cell structure of the DRAM according to the fourth embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a schematic cross sectional view of a DRAM and illustrates the case where the multi-layered bit line system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, double-layered bit lines are formed in a section that expands along bit lines. To be more specific, the double-layered bit lines are made up of a wiring layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed of tungsten and a wiring layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>made of a diffusion layer region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. In practice, the wiring layers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have cross sections that are different in shape. The double-layered bit lines, namely the wiring patterns <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, are twisted effectively because of the provision of the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The double-layered bit line system described above is only one example of a noise-reducing measure. Other noise-reducing measures are also known, such as a one-layer bit line system and a method wherein adjacent bit lines are shielded. These noise-reducing measures are also applicable to the DRAMs of the embodiments of the present invention without any problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> (Fifth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14, 15A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B show a cell structure of a DRAM according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a plan view showing a cell layout, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</cross-reference> are sectional views taken along line <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A and line <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the first to third embodiments described above, the minimum working dimension is set at F, and the pitch of the word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set at 2F. In this structure, however, the coupling due to potential fluctuations from an adjacent word line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may give rise to leakage or damage to storage data in an unselected cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the DRAM shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14, 15A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B, the pitch of the bit lines is increased from 2F to 3F, so as to prevent damage to the storage data. In the fifth embodiment, the minimum occupation area is 6F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>per cell (the pitch of word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is 2F). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>A, each silicon column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the word lines corresponding to it are located close to each other. However, the word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> corresponding to a given silicon column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are away from the adjacent silicon columns <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by space X, which is nearly equal to minimum working dimension F. With this structure, the word lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> corresponding to the given silicon column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> do not have any adverse effects on the vertical cell transistors formed by use of the adjacent cells. To be more specific, the vertical-type cell transistors are not undesirably turned on. Hence, the coupling due to potential fluctuations from an adjacent word line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> does not give rise to damage to storage data in an unselected cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the case of the fifth embodiment, the intervals between the bit line contacts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the vertical-type gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be increased. Where the intervals are increased, short-circuiting can be suppressed, and a high manufacturing yield is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
