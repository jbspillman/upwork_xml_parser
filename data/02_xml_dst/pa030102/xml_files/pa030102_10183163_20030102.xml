<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Next, in S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, when the transmitting/receiving device <highlight><bold>965</bold></highlight> of the server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> receives the information specifying the type of game program which will be run on the user&apos;s portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a processing program executed by the information processing device <highlight><bold>980</bold></highlight> of the server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> automatically creates a game image (by performing resize operations, etc.) based on the registered image selected and according to specifications of the image content used in the game of the selected game program. At this time, the information processing device <highlight><bold>980</bold></highlight> may convert the images for the game received from the personal computer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to a format compatible with the display capacity or display specifications of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> downloads the game program specified by the user, the information processing device <highlight><bold>980</bold></highlight> of the server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may automatically generate the display file block.html to notify the user by displaying the type of the game program and information about the download on the display device <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Also, when the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> downloads the game program specified by the user, the information processing device <highlight><bold>980</bold></highlight> of the server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may automatically generate the application attribute file blockjam for use in automatically downloading the game program and the image to be used for the game program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Next, in S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, by operating the input device <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the user enters an instruction to access the server (game providing server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>) for portable game devices in order to download the game program to the portable game device (portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). Then, the transmitting/receiving device <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> establishes a communications connection with the server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> via the portable telephone line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and communications network <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. When a connection is established between the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the processing goes to S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Next, in S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, by operating the input device <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the user enters an instruction to download the game program for portable terminals from the server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the user may start downloading the game program by specifying a URL contained in the e-mail received from the server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, or select the type of game program contained in the above-described display file block.html from a menu list on the display device <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and then select and download a desired game program. At this time, the application attribute file block jam is first received, for example, from the URL (http://abc/i/) of the server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> via the transmitting/receiving device <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> and stored in the JAM storage area of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Next, based on the package&apos;s URL contained in the above-described application attribute file received, the game program block jar is downloaded. Then, the block jar game program received via the transmitting/receiving device <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> is stored in the JAR storage area of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Next, in S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the user enters an instruction to run the received game program in the input device <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>. If two or more game programs are stored in the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the user selects the type of the desired game program from the information about the types of the multiple game programs displayed on the display device <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>, by entering an instruction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The information processing device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> reads the game program specified by the above-described user from the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> and starts running the specified game program. The game program contains a description of a process of checking whether the designated image used for the game is stored in the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. If it is judged that the designated image used for the game is stored in the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>, the information processing device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> reads the stored image (block.gif) and uses it for the game in S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> If it is judged that the designated image used for the game is not stored in the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> (because the game has never been run or the designated image used automatically for the game was erased when another game or the like was run, for example), the information processing device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> starts downloading, from the server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the image file block.gif found at a URL (e.g., http://abc/i/block.gif) listed in the application attribute file (block jam). The downloaded image is stored in a designated area (data storage area or the like) of the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. Next, in S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the information processing device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> reads the image file block.gif from the non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> and uses it for the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the information processing device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> reads the image content downloaded as described above and starts the game. Incidentally, the game program and the image used for the game may be delivered as separate files to the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as described above or may be stored in the same file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a display example of a Knock Over Blocks game using the game image transmitted by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in the drawing, the display device <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> of the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> displays the image <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> specified by the user and used for the Knock Over Blocks game, a ball <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which moves around automatically to knock over blocks, and a racket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which bounces the ball <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the image <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, moving freely from side to side as the user operates the input device <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The user erases the image <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> gradually as follows: he/she moves the racket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from side to side by operating the input device <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> to bounce back the ball <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in such a way that it will not fall to the bottom of the figure. The image <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been divided, for example, into <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> blocks. The blocks hit by the ball <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are erased. The user gets a score according to the number of erased blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The game ends when the entire image is erased, when the ball <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> drops to the bottom of the figure a preset number of times, or when the user calls an &ldquo;end&rdquo; to the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the present invention is not limited to the Knock Over Blocks game described above. Possible games include the one in which the user specifies a pair of cards via the input device <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> from among a plurality of cards arranged on the display device <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> as with the game of concentration and when the numbers on the pair of cards match, the corresponding parts (a pair of blocks) of the image <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are displayed. Besides, when the user is playing a concentration game with the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the pairs of blocks matched by the portable telephone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be blacked out instead of being displayed. In that case, the entire image is displayed if the user finds all the correct pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Another possible game will be as follows. The image <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> specified by the user is displayed on the display device <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> as it is shone by a spotlight which the user can move freely by operating the input device <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> or a spotlight which moves automatically. In so doing, that part of the image <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is not shone by the spotlight is displayed in black or dark gray while the part shone by the spotlight is displayed in the normal display color of the image <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Still another possible game is such that the user adds graffiti to an image specified by him/her, by operating the input device <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>. Besides, the present invention is not limited to game providing servers and game providing systems, but it is applicable to any system or server which can provide an amusement on a portable terminal based on images transmitted by a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As described above, since a game providing server and game providing system according to the present invention comprises a recording device which records game programs and information about types of the game programs by associating them with each other; a first transmitting device which reads the information about the types of game program out of the above-described recording device and transmits it to the user&apos;s communications terminal; a first receiving device which receives information specifying a type of game program to be run on the user&apos;s portable terminal and an image to be used for the game from the user&apos;s communications terminal; an image processing device which converts the above-described received image to be used for the game into a display image compatible with display capacity or display specifications of a display device installed on the user&apos;s portable terminal as required; and a second transmitting device which reads the specified game program from the above-described recording device and transmits it to the user&apos;s portable terminal together with the above-described display image, they allow the user to enjoy a game using a desired image on the user&apos;s portable terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the case of conventional game programs for portable terminals, since imaging resources for the games are contained in the game programs themselves and cannot be replaced by game images transmitted from users, the games are run only within the context of image contents prepared by game program developers. However, the game providing server and game providing system according to the present invention allow the user to transmit a desired image to the game providing server and run a game using that image on a portable terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the invention is to cover all modifications, alternate constructions and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims. </paragraph>
