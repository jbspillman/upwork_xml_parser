<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a transmission apparatus for providing DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The following technique is known for providing digital subscriber line (hereinafter abbreviated as &ldquo;DSL&rdquo;) services, which will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary structure of a conventional transmission apparatus for providing DSL services. The transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> comprises a DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, an optical modulation section <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, an optical transmission section <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, an optical detection section <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, an electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, and a DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> operates as follows. The optical modulation section <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> converts an inputted digital data signal into an optical signal, and sends it to the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>. The optical detection section <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> reconverts the optical signal which has been transmitted over the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> into the digital data signal, which is an electrical signal. The DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> converts the digital data signal outputted from the optical detection section <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> into a DSL modulated signal of a predetermined format, and sends it to the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. The DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> reconverts the DSL modulated signal which has been transmitted over the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> into the original digital data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is generally employed for DSL services. A typical DSL service is realized as follows: An optical transmission installation <highlight><bold>6001</bold></highlight> including the optical modulation section <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> may be installed at a central station of a telephone company or the like. An optical terminal device <highlight><bold>6002</bold></highlight> including the optical detection section <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and the DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> may be installed on top of a utility pole, on a side wall of a subscriber&apos;s residence, or in a common utility portion of a multi-dwelling, etc. A subscriber terminal <highlight><bold>6003</bold></highlight> including the DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> may be installed within a subscriber&apos;s residence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the above-described conventional transmission apparatus, a large part of the entire transmission path from the station equipment to the subscriber terminal is constructed of optical fibers (which have a relatively low loss) and digital signals are transmitted through this portion, thereby improving the transmission characteristics and relaxing the requirements for the performance of the transmission path. On the other hand, the end portion (i.e., from the optical terminal device to the subscriber terminal) of the entire transmission path,&mdash;that is, the wiring within the subscriber&apos;s residence&mdash;is composed of electric wiring such as twisted-pair cables, and DSL modulated signals are transmitted through this portion. Thus, the handling of the wiring within the subscriber&apos;s residence is facilitated, and the costs thereof can be reduced. In accordance with this conventional technique, the entire transmission system can be elongated, while providing good installability and economy of the equipment within the subscriber&apos;s residence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the above-described conventional transmission apparatus has a problem in that, due to the large size of the optical terminal device, there is a limit to the number of subscribers that can be accommodated, leading to high equipment costs, as described below. In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, the DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> needs to be included in the optical terminal device <highlight><bold>6002</bold></highlight>, thereby increasing the size of the optical terminal device <highlight><bold>6002</bold></highlight> and the costs associated with the optical terminal device <highlight><bold>6002</bold></highlight>. In the case where a plurality of subscribers are to be accommodated by this transmission apparatus as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> (two such subscribers are illustrated in the transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>), the optical transmission installation <highlight><bold>7001</bold></highlight> needs to include a multiplex section <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> for multiplexing a plurality of digital signals; and the optical terminal device <highlight><bold>7002</bold></highlight> needs to include a demultiplex section <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> for demultiplexing the digital signal outputted from the optical detection section <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and two DSL modulation sections <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> for converting the plurality of demultiplexed digital signals into respective DSL modulated signals. In particular, the optical terminal device <highlight><bold>7002</bold></highlight>, which is installed on the subscriber side, increases in size and the costs associated therewith increase, thereby unfavorably affecting the economy of the overall transmission apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the case where an ATM mode (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), which is commonly used for DSL systems, is adopted as the transmission format of the digital signals, the optical transmission installation and the optical terminal device need to be equipped with equipment and circuitry which support the ATM mode, thereby further increasing the costs associated therewith. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a transmission apparatus which can provide DSL services and the like at low costs and which allows the accommodatable number of subscribers to be easily expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention has the following features to attain the object above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention is directed to a transmission apparatus for providing a DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) service, comprising: a DSL modulation section for generating a DSL modulated signal based on an inputted digital data signal; an optical modulation section for converting the DSL modulated signal outputted from the DSL modulation section into an optical signal; an optical transmission section for transmitting the optical signal outputted from the optical modulation section; an optical detection section for reconverting the optical signal transmitted over the optical transmission section into the DSL modulated signal, the DSL modulated signal being an electrical signal; an electrical transmission section for transmitting the DSL modulated signal outputted from the optical detection section; and a DSL demodulation section for demodulating the DSL modulated signal transmitted over the electrical transmission section to reproduce the digital data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the first aspect, a digital signal is converted into a DSL modulated signal in an optical transmission installation, and the DSL modulated signal is optically transmitted. On the other hand, the DSL modulated signal is electrically transmitted from an optical terminal device to a subscriber terminal.

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the third aspect, a DSL modulated signal generated within an optical transmission installation is subjected to frequency conversion, and thereafter optically transmitted. As a result, the optical terminal device can be realized so as to be compact and low-cost, and both good installability and low cost of the transmission apparatus can be attained. Moreover, based on a simple construction, optical transmission can be effected using a selected frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A fourth aspect of the present invention is directed to a transmission apparatus for providing a DSL service, comprising: M modulation sections provided respectively corresponding to M digital data signals (where M is an integer equal to or greater than two), each including a DSL modulation section for generating a DSL modulated signal based on the respective inputted digital data signal, and a first frequency conversion section for subjecting the DSL modulated signal outputted from the DSL modulation section to frequency conversion so as to span a predetermined first frequency band, the M modulation sections generating M signals spanning respectively different first frequency bands; a combination section for multiplexing the M signals outputted from the M modulation sections and outputting an FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexed) signal; an optical modulation section for converting the FDM signal outputted from the combination section into an optical signal; an optical transmission section for transmitting the optical signal outputted from the optical modulation section; an optical detection section for reconverting the optical signal transmitted over the optical transmission section into the FDM signal, the FDM signal being an electrical signal; an electrical transmission section for transmitting the FDM signal outputted from the optical detection section; and a demodulation section including a second frequency conversion section for selecting one of the M signals contained in the FDM signal transmitted over the electrical transmission section and subjecting the selected signal to frequency conversion so as to span a predetermined second frequency band, and a DSL demodulation section for demodulating a signal outputted from the second frequency conversion section to reproduce the digital data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the fourth aspect, digital data signals on a plurality of channels are converted into DSL modulated signals, subjected to frequency conversion and multiplex, and then optically transmitted.

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating the structure of a transmission apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment comprises a DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, an optical modulation section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, an optical detection section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and a DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the optical modulation section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> constitute an optical transmission installation <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. The optical detection section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> constitutes an optical terminal device <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. The DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> constitutes a subscriber terminal <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> operates in the following manner. The DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> converts an inputted digital data signal into a DSL modulated signal of a predetermined format spanning the base band. The optical modulation section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> converts the DSL modulated signal into an optical signal and sends it onto the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The optical detection section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> reconverts the optical signal which has been transmitted over the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> into the DSL modulated signal, which is an electrical signal, and sends the DSL modulated signal onto the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reconverts the DSL modulated signal which has been transmitted over the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> into the original digital data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The DSL modulated signal outputted from the DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be a signal modulated by DMT(Discrete Multi Tone) modulation technique, a signal modulated by CAP (Carrierless Amplitude/Phase modulation) modulation technique, or a signal modulated by QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) modulation technique, or the like. The electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may be composed of a twisted-pair cable, a coaxial cable, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the above-described transmission apparatus, a large part of the entire transmission path from the station equipment to the subscriber terminal is constructed of an optical fiber (which has a relatively low loss), whereas the end portion (i.e., from the optical terminal device to the subscriber terminal) of the entire transmission path&mdash;that is, the wiring within the subscriber&apos;s residence&mdash;is composed of electric wiring such as twisted-pair cables. The DSL modulation section is installed in the optical transmission installation (which in turn is installed in the station), as opposed to the optical terminal device. Moreover, it is a DSL modulated signal that is transmitted throughout the entire transmission path including the optical transmission section and the electrical transmission section. Based on this structure, the optical terminal device can be downsized and realized at low costs. As a result, both good installability and low cost of the peripheral equipment of the subscriber&apos;s residence can be attained, and a transmission apparatus which is low-cost and easy to handle can be provided. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating the structure of a transmission apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment comprises a modulation section <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, an optical modulation section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, an optical detection section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and a demodulation section <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The modulation section <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the optical modulation section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> constitute an optical transmission installation <highlight><bold>12001</bold></highlight>. The optical detection section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> constitutes an optical terminal device <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. The demodulation section <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> constitutes a subscriber terminal <highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The modulation section <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> includes a DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a first frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The demodulation section <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> includes a second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and a DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The present embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that the first frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> are further comprised. Therefore, any component elements which function in similar manners to their counterparts in the first embodiment are denoted by like numerals, with the descriptions thereof omitted. The differences over the first embodiment will mainly be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the modulation section <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> first converts an inputted digital data signal into a DSL modulated signal. Next, the first frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> converts the DSL modulated signal outputted from the DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> into a frequency-converted signal which spans a predetermined first frequency band. The optical modulation section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> converts this frequency-converted signal into an optical signal, and sends it onto the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The optical detection section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> reconverts the optical signal which has been transmitted over the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> into the frequency-converted signal, which is an electrical signal, and sends it onto the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In the demodulation section <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> first subjects the frequency-converted signal which has been transmitted over the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to frequency conversion to reproduce the original DSL modulated signal. The DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reconverts the reproduced DSL modulated signal into the original digital data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The embodiment illustrates an example where the second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> performs a frequency conversion back to the same frequency band as the frequency band spanned by the DSL modulated signal outputted from the DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in order to reproduce the original DSL modulated signal. Alternatively, the frequency conversion may realize a frequency band which is different from the frequency band spanned by the DSL modulated signal outputted from the DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> so that a DSL modulated signal spanning a different frequency band is reproduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Thus, the above-described transmission apparatus converts a digital data signal into a DSL modulated signal, which is then subjected to frequency conversion and optically transmitted. Thus, there is provided a transmission apparatus which can realize optical transmission using a selected frequency band based on a simple construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> (Third Embodiment) </paragraph>

The modulation section <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the optical modulation section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> constitute an optical transmission installation <highlight><bold>12001</bold></highlight>. The optical detection section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> constitute an optical terminal device <highlight><bold>8002</bold></highlight>. The DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> constitutes a subscriber terminal <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>. The present embodiment differs from the second embodiment with respect to the position at which the second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (corresponding to the second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is inserted and the connection thereof. Therefore, any component elements which function in similar manners to their counterparts in the second embodiment are denoted by like numerals, with the descriptions thereof omitted. The differences over the second embodiment will mainly be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission installation <highlight><bold>12001</bold></highlight> converts an inputted digital data signal into a frequency-converted signal spanning a predetermined first frequency band, and further converts it to an optical signal, which is sent onto the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The optical detection section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> reconverts the optical signal which has been transmitted over the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> into the frequency-converted signal, which is an electrical signal. The second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> subjects the frequency-converted signal outputted from the optical detection section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to frequency conversion to reproduce the original DSL modulated signal, which is sent onto the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reconverts the DSL modulated signal which has been transmitted over the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> into the original digital data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As in the second embodiment, the present embodiment may be modified so that the second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> performs a frequency conversion to realize a frequency band which is different from the frequency band spanned by the DSL modulated signal outputted from the DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> so that a DSL modulated signal spanning a different frequency band is reproduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Thus, the above-described transmission apparatus converts a digital data signal into a DSL modulated signal, which is then subjected to frequency conversion and optically transmitted. Thus, there is provided a transmission apparatus which can realize optical transmission using a selected frequency band based on a simple construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> (Fourth Embodiment) </paragraph>

Therefore, any component elements which function in similar manners to their counterparts in the second embodiment are denoted by like numerals, with the descriptions thereof omitted. The differences over the second embodiment will mainly be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The modulation sections <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are provided respectively corresponding to a plurality of digital data signals inputted to the optical transmission installation <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> (two such signals are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The DSL modulation sections <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in the modulation sections <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> first convert respective digital data signals into respective DSL modulated signals. Next, the respective first frequency conversion sections <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> convert the DSL modulated signals outputted from the respective DSL modulation sections <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> into first and second frequency-converted signals, which span respectively different predetermined frequency bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The combination section <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> combines the first and second frequency-converted signals outputted from the two modulation sections <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through frequency-division-multiplex (FDM: Frequency Division Multiplex), and outputs the resultant signal to the optical modulation section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Hereinafter, such a signal, obtained by subjecting a plurality of signals to frequency division multiplex, will be referred to as an &ldquo;FDM signal&rdquo;. The optical modulation section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> converts the FDM signal into an optical signal, and sends it onto the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The optical detection section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> reconverts the optical signal which has been transmitted over the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> into the FDM signal, which is an electrical signal, and sends it onto the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In the demodulation section <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> first selectively extracts either a first or second frequency-converted signal from the FDM signal which has been transmitted over the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and subjects the selected signal to frequency conversion. As a result, either one of the DSL modulated signals outputted from the two DSL modulation sections <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is reproduced. Next, the DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reconverts the reproduced DSL modulated signal into the original digital data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Although the transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is illustrated to include two modulation sections <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, any number of modulation sections <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>&mdash;equal to or greater than two&mdash;may be provided in the transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the above-described transmission apparatus, digital data signals on a plurality of channels are converted into DSL modulated signals, subjected to frequency conversion and multiplex, and then optically transmitted.

Therefore, any component elements which function in similar manners to their counterparts in the fourth embodiment are denoted by like numerals, with the descriptions thereof omitted. The differences over the fourth embodiment will mainly be described below. Although not shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> for conciseness, each modulation section <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> includes a DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a first frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, as in the fourth embodiment. Similarly, in all of the following embodiments, it shall be understood that the modulation section <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> includes a DSL modulation section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a first frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission installation <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> converts a plurality of inputted digital data signals (two such signals are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) into DSL modulated signals spanning respectively different frequency bands, multiplex these signals to generate an FDM signal, converts the FDM signal into an optical signal, which is sent onto the optical transmission section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>.

The DSL demodulation section <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reconverts the DSL modulated signal which has been transmitted over the electrical transmission section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> into the original digital data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> As in the fourth embodiment, any number of modulation sections <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>&mdash;equal to or greater than two&mdash;may be provided in the transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Thus, the above-described transmission apparatus converts digital data signals on a plurality of channels into DSL modulated signals, which are subjected to frequency conversion and multiplexed. The resultant signal is optically transmitted, again subjected to frequency conversion, and then electrically transmitted.

Therefore, any component elements which function in similar manners to their counterparts in the twenty-first embodiment are denoted by like numerals, with the descriptions thereof omitted. The differences over the twenty-first embodiment will mainly be described below. </paragraph>

The first digital data UD is transmitted based on the following principle. The plurality of first modulation/demodulation sections <highlight><bold>3111</bold></highlight>, all of which have the same construction, each generate a first DSL modulated signal spanning the first base frequency band (fu).

The two third frequency conversion sections <highlight><bold>2103</bold></highlight> each convert the second DSL modulated signal outputted from the two second separation sections <highlight><bold>3122</bold></highlight> via the bi-directional electrical transmission sections <highlight><bold>3150</bold></highlight> into signals spanning respectively different frequency bands (f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>B, the first DSL modulated signal and the second DSL modulated signal which are transmitted between a first transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>31001</bold></highlight> and a second transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>31002</bold></highlight> corresponding to one subscriber pair are converted into respectively different frequency bands (f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, or f<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and f<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and then multiplexed. It is conceivable that, for reasons associated with the frequency separation performance of the first separation section <highlight><bold>3121</bold></highlight> (or the second separation section <highlight><bold>3122</bold></highlight>), a leak (i.e., cross-talk) component of the second DSL modulated signal (or the first DSL modulated signal) outputted from the fourth frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>2114</bold></highlight> (or the second frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>2112</bold></highlight>) may be mixed in the first DSL modulated signal (or the second DSL modulated signal) which is inputted to the first frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>2101</bold></highlight> (or the third frequency conversion section <highlight><bold>2103</bold></highlight>). Even in such cases, the transmission quality of the first DSL modulated signal (or the second DSL modulated signal) is not degraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>C, the first DSL modulated signal and the second DSL modulated signal, which are optically transmitted between the first transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>31001</bold></highlight> and the second transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>31002</bold></highlight> corresponding to a plurality of subscriber pairs, are converted into signals spanning respectively different but adjoining frequency bands, and then multiplexed. In other words, when in the form of optically transmitted signals, the first DSL modulated signals and the second DSL modulated signals alternate on the frequency axis. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31, a</cross-reference> majority of the non-linear second-order distortions which may occur in the transmission process of the first FDM signal, i.e., the group of frequency-converted signals (f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . , f<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) of the first DSL modulated signals lie in the frequency bands (f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , f<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>) corresponding to the second FDM signal, so that they do not substantially undermine the transmission quality of the first DSL modulated signals. Similarly, a majority of the non-linear second-order distortions which may occur in the transmission process of the second FDM signal, i.e., the group of frequency-converted signals (f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , f<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>) of the second DSL modulated signal lie in the frequency bands (f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . , f<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) corresponding to the first FDM signal, so that they do not substantially undermine the transmission quality of the second DSL modulated signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the above-described transmission apparatus, a plurality of bi-directional transmission signals outputted from transmission/reception circuits respectively corresponding to a plurality of subscriber pairs are converted into signals spanning respectively different frequency bands, and are transmitted as one FDM signal. As a result, the number of optical transmission lines can be reduced. Thus, a low-cost bi-directional transmission apparatus can be provided even in the case where there is a large number of subscriber pairs. Moreover, even if cross-talk between bi-directional signals and/or transmission distortion occurs for reasons associated with the characteristics of the circuitry and devices composing the apparatus, substantial deterioration in the transmission quality does not occur. Thus, a high-quality bi-directional transmission apparatus can be provided. </paragraph>

Each first transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>34001</bold></highlight> includes a first modulation/demodulation section <highlight><bold>3111</bold></highlight> and a first separation section <highlight><bold>3121</bold></highlight>. Each second transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>34002</bold></highlight> includes a second modulation/demodulation section <highlight><bold>3112</bold></highlight>.

Each second transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>34002</bold></highlight> constitutes a subscriber terminal <highlight><bold>42003</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment differs from the twenty-ninth embodiment in that the first optical combination/splitter section <highlight><bold>3401</bold></highlight>, the second optical combination/splitter section <highlight><bold>3402</bold></highlight>, and the bi-directional optical transmission section <highlight><bold>3403</bold></highlight> are comprised instead of a first optical transmission section <highlight><bold>1031</bold></highlight> and a second optical transmission section <highlight><bold>1032</bold></highlight>. Therefore, any component elements which function in similar manners to their counterparts in the twenty-ninth embodiment are denoted by like numerals, with the descriptions thereof omitted. The differences over the twenty-ninth embodiment will mainly be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The first optical combination/splitter section <highlight><bold>3401</bold></highlight> sends a first optical signal outputted from the first optical modulation section <highlight><bold>1021</bold></highlight> onto the bi-directional optical transmission section <highlight><bold>3403</bold></highlight>, and outputs a second optical signal which has been outputted from the second optical modulation section <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> and transmitted over the bi-directional optical transmission section <highlight><bold>3403</bold></highlight> to the second optical detection section <highlight><bold>1042</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Thus, without employing dedicated optical transmission lines for the two optical signals which are transmitted in a bi-directional manner, the above-described transmission apparatus direction-multiplexes both signals onto a single optical fiber.
