<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a contact roller system of a winding machine for thin strip material, in particular, a slitter rewinder for longitudinally slitting thin materials into individual strips and winding the individual strips onto slit rolls. The system comprises contact roller segments which are moved against the slit rolls during the winding process by means of a drive and are supported end face to end face adjacent to one another so as to be freely rotatable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The contact roller segments of a known contact roller system of this kind disclosed in German patent application 198 05 412 A1 for a winding machine for winding thin strip material are provided in order to prevent as much as possible the introduction of air into wound material of the slits rolls, in particular, at high winding speeds, and to ensure proper winding of the strip material in this way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The contact position and the contact pressure of each contact roller segment of the contact roller system are individually adjustable in order to compensate unavoidable diameter differences of the strip rolls. Each contact roller segment is freely rotatably supported at its end faces on two lateral bearing plates which are fastened on a carriage arranged on a transverse beam and movable by means of a linear drive perpendicularly to the axis of rotation of the slit roll toward and away from the slit roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to keep the gap between two neighboring contact roller segments as small as possible so as to prevent markings on the wound strip material, in the known contact roller system the lateral bearing plates of two neighboring contact roller segments are arranged alternatingly above and below the axis of rotation of the roller segments perpendicularly to the movement direction thereof during advancing against the slit rolls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The configuration of this known contact roller system is complex because for supporting each contact roller segment two bearing plates with two axle supports must be provided. A further disadvantage of the contact roller system is to be seen in that the control of the contact position of the contact roller segments, which changes constantly as a result of the changing winding diameter of the slit rolls, operates imprecisely based on a linear movement of the roller segments. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to improve a contact roller system of a winding machine for thin strip material of the aforementioned kind with respect to its configuration and the control of the contact position of the contact roller segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, this is achieved by providing pivot levers, arranged on a shaft in a row adjacent to one another and provided with an actuating drive as well as with two contact roller segments on opposite sides of the pivot levers, which contact roller segments are freely rotatably supported on an axis of rotation parallel to the pivot axis of the pivot levers, wherein the axes of rotation of the contact roller segment pairs have a common pivot radius and wherein a gap required for the rotational movement of the roller segments is formed between two neighboring contact roller segments, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> By furnishing the contact roller system according to the invention with pivot levers, arranged on a common rotary shaft in a row adjacent to one another and provided with an actuating drive, the pivot levers having on opposed sides two contact roller segments that are supported on axle supports so as to be freely rotatable on an axis of rotation that is parallel to the pivot axis of the pivot levers, a constructive simplification relative to the contact roller system according to the prior art is realized. The system according to the invention enables an optimal control of the contact position of the individual contact roller segments on the slit rolls during winding of thin material strips. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, slitter rewinders for longitudinal slitting of a material into individual strips and winding of the individual strips onto slip rolls are provided with the contact roller system according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Two axle supports <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are connected by screwing to both opposite sides of the pivot levers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on which the contact roller segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are rotatably supported by means of ball bearings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. An outer running layer or coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of rubber is applied to the contact roller segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Instead of the axle supports <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the contact roller segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> being connected by screwing to the pivot levers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the axle supports can be formed as a monolithic part of the pivot lever, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The contact roller system has a double-T shaped transverse beam <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> provided with three support arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for a rotatable or stationary support of the shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the pivot levers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and further provided with fixed pivot brackets <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with an actuating piston <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> provided for moving the pivot levers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the contact roller segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> against the slit rolls <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with an actuating piston <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are inserted into the pivot levers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is movable parallel to the pivot axis <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the pivot levers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. On the actuating piston <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> a locking bolt <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is provided which can be inserted into a corresponding receiving bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the neighboring pivot lever <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a rigid coupling of two neighboring contact roller segments pairs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The pivot levers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which are actuated by the actuating devices <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and have the contact roller segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> freely rotatably supported on both sides thereof, respectively, enable a very precise control of the contact position of the contact roller segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on a slit roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which contact position is always changing during winding, as well as a very precise control of the contact pressure of the contact roller segments. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the case of very sensitive materials, for example, aluminum foil of a thickness of less than 10 &mgr;, even very small gaps <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> between two neighboring contact roller segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can lead to annular markings on a slit roll <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. For preventing such markings, the transverse beam <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the contact roller system is subjected to a traversing movement together with the pivot levers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the contact roller segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which are freely rotatably supported thereon, this traversing movement being carried out in a direction of the arrows a, b transverse to the running direction of the strip <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to be wound. In this way, the position of the gaps <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> between two neighboring contact roller segments <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is constantly changed. </paragraph>
