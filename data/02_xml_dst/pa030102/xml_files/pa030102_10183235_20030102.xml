<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention mainly relates to a mounting structure for an axle rolling bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An axle rolling bearing in a vehicle has such a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>. This axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an outer ring member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which is non-rotatably supported by a mounting member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> mounted to a vehicle body (which mounting member will be referred to as &ldquo;knuckle&rdquo; hereinafter), an inner ring member <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> which is arranged inward in the diameter direction of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and balls <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in a plurality of rows which can freely roll between the outer ring member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the inner ring member <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An mounting structure for attaching the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> constituted as stated above, to the knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This mounting structure includes an annular anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> which is formed by protruding the vehicle inner side A outside surface of the knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> inward in the diameter direction so as to restrict the outer member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from moving toward the vehicle inner side A. In addition, this mounting structure includes the following means for restricting the outer ring member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from moving toward a vehicle outer side B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Specifically, this means has a sleeve <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of an L-shaped cross section which is fitted into the vehicle outer side B edge section of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a groove <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> which is formed in the end portion of the vehicle outer side B inner peripheral surface of the central bore of the knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has elastic pieces <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> engaged with the groove <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> at predetermined intervals in the peripheral direction of the sleeve <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> With this mounting structure, if the outer ring member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is inserted into the central bore of the knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the elastic pieces <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are pressed by the end portion of the outer peripheral surface of the central bore of the knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and bent to be fall toward an axial center. If the outer ring member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is inserted into a predetermined position, i.e., inserted until the end portion of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> abuts on the anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, then the elastic pieces <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> rise by their own elastic forces and enter the groove <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The outside surfaces of the elastic pieces <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> abutted on and engaged with the wall surface of the groove <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, whereby it is possible to prevent the outer ring member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from slipping out to the vehicle outer side B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, recently, the reduction of axle rolling bearings of this type in the direction of the axial center is underway. With the mounting structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>, however, the bent portion of the sleeve <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> protrudes from the outside surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> toward the vehicle outer side B by as much as the thickness thereof (as indicated by &agr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>). In addition, the wall surface of the end portion of the central bore is required to have a predetermined length so as to allow the elastic pieces <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to fall and the knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is required to have that length in addition of the axial center accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As can be understood, if the axial width of the knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is secured for the mounting structure, the degree of freedom of design is disadvantageously lowered. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a mounting structure for a rolling bearing (or an axle rolling bearing, in particular) capable of decreasing the axial width of a knuckle as much as possible and improving the degree of freedom of design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent from the following description of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A rolling bearing mounting structure according to the present invention is for mounting a rolling bearing to an insertion bore formed in a support member, wherein the support member non-rotatably supports an outer ring member provided at the rolling bearing around an axial center, and the rolling bearing mounting structure is provided with: an anti-slip piece formed on an axial end portion of the insertion bore formed in the support member, for preventing the rolling bearing from slipping out of the insertion bore toward one of one side and the other side of the insertion bore in a direction of the axial center; a first concave section formed at a position halfway along the insertion bore in the direction of the axial center, in a circumferential direction; a second concave section formed at a position opposed to the first concave section in a diameter direction on an outer peripheral surface of the outer ring provided at the rolling bearing, in the circumferential direction; and an anti-slip member engaged with engagement surfaces formed on the first concave section and the second concave section, respectively, and preventing the rolling bearing from slipping out of the insertion bore toward the other one of one side and the other side of the support member in the direction of the axial center.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> mounting structure for a rolling bearing according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinafter. In this embodiment, the rolling bearing of the present invention is applied to an axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the overall configuration of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will first be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a single cylindrical outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, cylindrical inner ring members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in two rows which are arranged inward in the diameter direction of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and which are rotatably supported around an axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, balls <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in two rows which are arranged to freely roll in an annular bearing space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> between the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the both inner ring members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (one example of rolling elements). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The balls <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in two rows are held in a cage <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at circumferentially equidistant positions, respectively. The outer peripheral surface of each inner ring member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is employed as the inner ring bearing surface of each ball <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The inner peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is employed as the outer ring bearing surface of ball <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of each row. In addition, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a sealing member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is arranged on the vehicle inner side A and vehicle outer side B end portions of an annular bearing space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, for filling the annular bearing space <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with lubricant and preventing the entry of slurry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The barrel section of a hub wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which attaches a brake disc rotor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is press-fitted into the inner peripheral surfaces of the inner ring members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The vehicle outer side B of this hub wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an enlarged diameter, whereby a hub flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which abuts on the attachment convex surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the brake disc rotor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed. The hub flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fixed to the brake disc rotor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by an attachment bolt <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Reference symbol <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> indicates a hub bolt which fixes a tire wheel, not shown, to the brake disc rotor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> An axial section (axle) <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is formed integrally with the bowl-shaped outer ring section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of a uniform joint <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provided on a vehicle body side is inserted into the central bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the hub wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by spline S-fitting. A nut <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is engaged with the vehicle outer side B end portion of the axle <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The fastening force of this nut <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can prevent the axle <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the hub wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from separating in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As the uniform joint <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a joint referred to as &ldquo;Zepper type (or Barfield type) joint&rdquo; is employed. This uniform joint <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided with an inner ring section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which fixedly inserts the end portion of a driving shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> into the bowl-shaped outer ring section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a ball <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which guides the hub wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> aslant to the driving shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and a cage <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for holding the ball <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> An mounting structure for mounting the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a support member (to be referred to as &ldquo;knuckle&rdquo; hereinafter) <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> attached to the vehicle body side is provided. An insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for inserting the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) into the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed in the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The mounting structure includes an annular anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is formed by protruding the vehicle inner side A outside surface of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> inward in the diameter direction. This anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is provided to prevent the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from moving from the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> toward the vehicle inner side A (one side in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A distance from the vehicle outer side B outside surface of the anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the vehicle outer side B end portion of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the direction of the axial center is set equal to that of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The mounting structure also includes the following means for restricting the axle rolling bearing from moving toward the vehicle outer side B (the other side in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this means consists of an annular mounting concave section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> serving as the first concave section which is formed halfway along the inner peripheral surface of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, i.e., formed circumferentially halfway along the outer peripheral surface of an insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> formed in the central portion of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and which is opened inward in the diameter direction, an annular engagement concave section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> serving as the second concave section which is formed at a position opposed to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> halfway along the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and which is opened outward in the diameter direction, and an anti-slip member (which is also referred to as &ldquo;retainer&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is fitted into the bottom of the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and which has inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> each having a reduced diameter toward the vehicle inner side A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are formed circumferentially at equidistant positions by cutting and raising a plurality of predetermined portions from an annular main body (the base section of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at predetermined intervals (e.g., at intervals of 30 degrees in a circumferential direction), respectively. These inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are each given a predetermined elastic force by, for example, hardening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The vehicle inner side A sidewall of the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed on a surface perpendicular to the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (which includes a radial direction). This sidewall is employed as an engagement surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which the bent end portions <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are abutted on and thereby engaged with. The both side end portions of the main body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the direction of the axial center are in a state in which they are prevented from moving in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by using the both sidewalls of the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> as supports therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As described above, the main body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed annularly. The main body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is cut off halfway in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. By providing this cutoff section, the main body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed to be able to have reduced or expanded diameter per se. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The mounting concave section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> also serves as a containing concave section <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which contains the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are pressed by the vehicle inner side A outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and thereby elastically deformed while the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is being press-fitted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer side B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> indicates a circular arc-shaped press-fit bore. This press-fit bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is arranged at a predetermined position of the hub flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> opposed to the outside surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and in the circumferential direction along with it (which predetermined position corresponds to a position between the bolt insertion bores). This press-fit bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided to insert a press-fit tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which abuts on the outside surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and press-fits the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which is provided on the vehicle body side in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the press-fit tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> consists of an annular operating section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on which the pressure force of a pressure unit, not shown, directly acts, and four pressure sections <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which protrude from the side surface of this operating section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Each pressure section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is provided to abut on the outside surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby forcing the entire axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the vehicle outer side B through the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Each pressure section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is formed relatively to the press-fit bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> so as to be able to be inserted into the press-fit bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the contact outside surface of each pressure section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the diameter direction is set slightly larger than that of one outside surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the outer peripheral corner section of the contact outside surface of each pressure section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is notched to have a circular arc-shaped cross section to thereby form a concave section <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. This concave section <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> slightly allows the insertion of the outer end portion of the insertion bore of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Next, a method of attaching the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will be described. First, the inner ring members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are assembled with the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the balls <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> held in the cages <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, respectively, thereby forming the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The axial section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the hub wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is press-fit into the central bores of the inner ring members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively, from the vehicle outer side B, thereby providing a hub unit in which the axle rolling bearing is integrated with the hub wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Separately from the above, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer side B with the diameter reduced against its elastic force and then fitted into the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which is formed halfway along the inner peripheral surface of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. At this moment, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is attached to the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in such a direction in which the diameters of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are reduced on the vehicle inner side A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the center of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is then stabilized relative to the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Each of the pressure sections <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the press-fit tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is inserted into the press-fit bores <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the hub flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively and abutted on the outside surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The operating section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the press-fit tool <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is sequentially pressed toward the vehicle inner side A by the pressure unit, and the vehicle inner side A outside surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is abutted on the anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As a result, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is retained in the vehicle outer side B toward the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Since the distance from the vehicle outer side A outside surface of the anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the vehicle outer side A end portion of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is set equal to that of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the vehicle outer side end portion of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and that of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are located in the same plane in the diameter direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> If the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> formed as a hub unit is press-fitted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer side B, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are pressed by the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring ember <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, elastically deformed as indicated by a virtual line shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, evaded and contained in the containing concave section <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which state is maintained. Further, by forcing the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> release from the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by their elastic forces, and enter the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, whereby the outside surfaces of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> abut on the engagement surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (vehicle inner side A sidewall) of the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The engagement force for engaging the outside surfaces of the inclined engagement section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> with the engagement surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can prevent the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (hub unit) from slipping out from the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the vehicle outer side B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A state in which the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> enter the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by their elastic forces, is equal to a state in which the vehicle inner side A outside surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> abuts on the anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Consequently, it is possible to prevent the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (hub unit) from slipping out of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the vehicle inner side A and the vehicle outer side B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As can be seen, according to this embodiment, the mounting structure which consists of the annular anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> formed by protruding the vehicle inner side A outside surface of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> inward in the diameter direction, the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> formed halfway along the inner peripheral surface of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the circumferential direction thereof, the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed at the position opposed to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> halfway along the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> fitted into the bottom of the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and having reduced diameters toward the vehicle inner side A, can prevent the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from slipping out of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Further, as stated above, if the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is inserted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> until the vehicle inner side A outside surface of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> abuts on the anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the vehicle outer side B outside surface of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and that of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are consistent with each other in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and located in the same plane in the diameter direction. Due to this, unlike the conventional structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>, it does not occur that the bent section of the sleeve protrudes from the outside surface of the outer ring member toward the vehicle outer side B by as much as the thickness thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the conventional art, the end portion of the sidewall of the central bore is required to have a predetermined length so as to make the elastic piece fall sideways, and the knuckle is required to have that the length in a direction of the axial center. In this embodiment, by contrast, the vehicle outer side B outside surface of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and that of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be set consistent with each other in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and located in the same plane in the diameter direction. It is, therefore, possible to reduce the size of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and to thereby improve the degree of freedom of design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The predetermined elastic force applied to above-mentioned inclined engagement section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is required to maintain a state in which the outside surface of the inclined engagement section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is abutted on and engaged with the engagement surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> even if a force for moving the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> toward the vehicle outer side B acts on the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the time of using the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by attaching the bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Further, if the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for maintenance, the withdrawal is conducted by pulling out the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> toward the vehicle outer side B against the predetermined elastic forces of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, i.e., the engagement force for engaging the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> with the engagement surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. During the withdrawal, the bent sections of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> overpass the engagement surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are contained again in the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. In this state, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are pressed by the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby sliding the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> After attaching the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the axial section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the uniform joint <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is fitted into the central bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the hub wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by spline S-fitting. The nut <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is engaged with the vehicle outer side B outside surface of the axial section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The fastening force applies predetermined pre-load to the balls <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in respective rows and connects the axial section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the hub wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in an inseparable fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is press-fitted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the pressure sections <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the press-fit tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are inserted into the respective press-fit bores <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be abutted on the outside surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby pressing the overall axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It is, therefore, possible to press-fit the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> without damaging the balls <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the respective rows and with simple operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible to ensure press-fitting the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> using the press-fit tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with the simple configuration in which the pressure sections <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> inserted into the press-fit bores <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> formed in the hub flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> An mounting structure according to another preferred embodiment will be described below with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> consists of a main body <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The continuous section in which the inclined engaged sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are continuous to the main body <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, is notched in a circular arc manner to be thereby formed into a thin, fragile section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> compared with the other sections. The inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are formed at equidistant positions of the main body <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in the circumferential direction thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The containing concave section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is provided to contain the inclined engaged sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> after the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are pressed by the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and elastically deformed if an axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is forced into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer B side. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> With the above-stated configuration, if the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached to the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is first attached to the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In the attachment of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is inserted into the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> while the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is kept to have a reduced diameter so that the diameters of the inclined engagement section <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are reduced toward the vehicle inner side A. Thereafter, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is restored so that the diameter thereof is expanded by its elastic force, thereby fitting the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> into the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The end portions on the both sides of the main body <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are supported by the support sections which are both sidewalls of the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and suppressed from moving in the direction of an axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Next, using a press-fit tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is forced into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer side B. If so, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are pressed by the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, elastically deformed, and contained in the containing concave section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> enter the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by their elastic forces at positions consistent with the position at which the end portion of the inner ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> abuts on the anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The outside surfaces of the inclined engagement section <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are abutted on and engaged with the engagement surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. As a result, it is possible to prevent the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from slipping out of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> toward the vehicle outer side B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be reduced in size as in the case of the preceding embodiment, so that the degree of freedom of design can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Further, if the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for maintenance, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is pulled out toward the vehicle outer side B against the predetermined elastic forces of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to thereby break it in the fragile section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> maybe withdrawn from the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> using, for example, a release tool <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the release tool <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is inserted through the press-fit bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> formed in a hub flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and forced into the clearance between the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> until the tip end portion of the release tool <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> contacts with the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Next, a press-fit tool <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> as indicated by the virtual line shown therein is inserted into the press-fit bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer side B and the press-fit tool <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is further forced into the press-fit bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by a predetermined pressure unit. The inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are elastically deformed by forcing the press-fit tool <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> into the press-fit bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the outside surfaces of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are released from the engagement surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are contained in the containing concave section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, whereby the engagement state in which the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are engaged with the engagement surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is released. In this way, while disengaging the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> from the engagement surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is pulled out from the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The fragile section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a continuous section in which the main body <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are continuous to the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. By providing trapezoidal notch grooves <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on both sides thereof in the circumferential direction, the section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> become fragile.

<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> consists of an annular main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which abuts on both sidewalls, serving as support members of the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and which is prevented from moving in the direction of an axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which are formed integrally with the main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and inclined so as to enlarge a diameter toward the vehicle inner side A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is formed annularly in the same way of the preceding embodiments. The main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is cut off halfway along the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. By providing this cutoff section, the main body <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed to be able to have a reduced or enlarged diameter. The plurality inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are formed, at predetermined intervals, on the main body in the circumferential direction thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The mounting concave section <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> also serves as a containing concave section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which contains the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> when the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are pressed by the vehicle inner side A outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and thereby elastically deformed while the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is being press-fitted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer side B. Since the remaining constituent components are the same as those in the preceding embodiments, they are indicated by the same reference numerals, respectively and will not be described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> With the above-stated configuration, if the axle rolling bearing (or a hub unit) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is inserted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer side B while the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is attached to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are pressed to the inner peripheral surface of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and contained in the containing concave section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. While the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is being compressed, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> slide on the inner peripheral surface of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. And when the end portion of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> abuts on the anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> enters the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by their elastic forces. As a result, the outside surfaces of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are engaged with the engagement surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is prevented from moving toward the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a hub wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is press-fitted into the inner ring member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer side A, a brake disc rotor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is mounted to a hub flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the axial section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of a uniform joint <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is spline S-fitted into the central bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the hub wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the vehicle inner side A and a nut <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is fastened to the end portion of the axial section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>.

In addition, by forming a fragile section in a continuous section in which the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are continuous to the main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be forced to be withdrawn from the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by a predetermined force by detaching forcedly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Next, a mounting structure according to another preferred embodiment will be described on the basis of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>. The mounting structure in this embodiment includes an anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which is formed on a knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> so as to prevent an axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from moving toward a vehicle inner side A (one side in the direction of an axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). To prevent the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from moving toward a vehicle outer side B, the mounting structure also includes a mounting concave section <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> which is formed halfway along the inner peripheral surface of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, an engagement concave section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which is formed at a position opposed to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on the outer peripheral surface of an outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> while the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached to the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and an anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is formed into crown shape out of an annular main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which is formed to have a reduced diameter toward the vehicle inner side A and inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which are formed on the extension of the main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, equal in inclination to the main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and formed at intervals of predetermined angles in a circumferential direction. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is formed annularly in the same way of the preceding embodiment and cut off halfway along the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. By providing this cutoff section, the main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is formed to be able to have a reduced or enlarged diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In addition, the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> also serves as a containing concave section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which contains the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> when the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are pressed by the vehicle inner side A outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and thereby elastically deformed while the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is being press-fitted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer side B. Since the remaining constituent components are the same as those in the above-mentioned first embodiment, they are indicated by the same reference numerals, respectively and will not be described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> With the above-stated configuration, if the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (or hub unit) is inserted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as in the case of the preceding embodiments, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are pressed to the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and contained in the containing concave section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. While the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is being forced into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> slide on the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When the end portion of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> abuts on the anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> enter the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by their elastic forces and the outside surfaces of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are engaged with the engagement surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is prevented from moving toward vehicle outer side B.

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> If the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the nut <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is loosened to detach the axial section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the uniform joint <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is forced to pull out against the engagement force engaging the outside surfaces of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with the engagement surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. If so, the outside surfaces of the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are pushed up along the engagement surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are contained in the containing concave section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. While the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is being pulled out, the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> slide on the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, by forming a fragile section in a continuous section in which the inclined engagement sections <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are continuous to the main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the fragile section may be forced to be cut off by a predetermined force to thereby withdraw the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> show another embodiment of an anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a peculiar function. That is, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment is such that a support <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> for supporting a vehicle speed sensor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed integrally with the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 11</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In the examples shown in drawings, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is formed by bending the neck section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the support <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> from the main body <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and rounding a grip section <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, i.e., a section to which the vehicle speed sensor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the drawings, an anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed on the vehicle inner side A of a knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. An mounting concave section <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed on the vehicle outer side B of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and an engagement concave section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is formed on the vehicle outer side B outside surface of an outer ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to reduce the diameter of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Further, an annular mounting angle (e.g., a metal ring of a package seal) is fixed to an inner ring member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a pulsar ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is provided at a position of the mounting angle opposed to the detection section of the vehicle speed sensor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. It is noted that the shapes of the remaining constituent components except the support <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are the same as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In each of the preceding embodiments, the attachment member is cut off halfway along the circumferential direction so that the diameter thereof can be freely reduced or enlarged. It is considered that, in such a configuration, the rigidity is lower than that of a configuration in which the attachment member is formed annularly without providing any cutoff section, by as much as the provision of the cutoff section. Therefore, hereinafter, an embodiment in which the rigidity of the anti-slip member is improved from those in the preceding embodiment will next be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a mounting structure consists of an anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is formed by reducing the diameter of the vehicle inner side A of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of a knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> inward in a diameter direction, an annular mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> which is formed along a peripheral direction toward a vehicle outer side B on the peripheral surface of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> supported by the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, and an engagement concave section <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which is formed toward the vehicle outer side B on the outer peripheral surface of an outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and into which the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is inserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is formed by an annular main body <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, an attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is formed integrally with the vehicle outer side B of the main body <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. The attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is pressed by the peripheral surface of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the diameter thereof is reduced when the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is inserted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> from the outer side B. The diameter of the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is enlarged in case of being attached to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided to engage the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with a continuous, outer-side engagement surface <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> with a step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The stabilization deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is formed integrally with the vehicle inner side A of the main body <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. If an axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is inserted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> from the outer side B after the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is attached to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is pressed by the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the diameter thereof is enlarged against an elastic force. Thereafter, the diameter of the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is reduced by the elastic force so that the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> enters the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> formed at a position opposed to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in the diameter direction on the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and engaged with an inner-side engagement surface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> formed on the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are formed at predetermined intervals in the circumferential direction to thereby form into gear shape. The attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are formed so that the base sections thereof on the main body <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> side are plasticity toward the main body <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are formed so that the diameters thereof are sequentially reduced from the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The maximum diameter R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is set larger than the diameter R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the inner side A of insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The minimum diameter R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is set smaller than the outer peripheral diameter R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (almost equal to the diameter R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>). As a result, it is possible that the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> enters the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and can be engaged with the outer-side engagement surface <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> thereof. The stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> enters the engagement concave section <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and can be engaged with the inner-side engagement surface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with a step continuous to the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

This permission concave section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is formed to be smaller in diameter than the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The diameter of the outer side B end portion of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is set smaller than that of the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and larger than the diameter R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the inner side A of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The width of the overall mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> including the permission concave section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in the direction of an axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is set almost equal to that of the overall entire anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Since the constituent components of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are the same as those in the preceding embodiments, they are indicated by the same reference numerals, respectively and will not be described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Procedures for attaching the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will next be described. First, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is inserted from the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> side into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is attached to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> formed on the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> At this moment, by setting the minimum diameter R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the stabilizing deformed section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to be smaller than the diameter R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (the diameter of the vehicle outer side B end portion), the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be easily inserted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, but the maximum diameter R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is set larger than the diameter R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> However, the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is formed to be bent toward the main body <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and formed into gear shape. Therefore, if the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is pressed toward the inner side A, the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is pressed by the peripheral surface of the outer side B end portion of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the diameter thereof is reduced. As a result, by pressing the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> against the elastic force of the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> By further pressing the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> toward the vehicle inner side A, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> enters the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and is restored to its original shape so as to enlarge the diameter of the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the end portion thereof is engaged with the vehicle outer-side engagement surface <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is then attached to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is formed to be inclined so that the diameter thereof is sequentially reduced from the main body <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> side toward the vehicle inner side A. The minimum diameter R<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is set almost equal to the diameter R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the maximum diameter R<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> thereof is set larger than the diameter R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>.

First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is inserted from the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> side into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is attached to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> which is formed on the peripheral surface of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> At this moment, since the minimum diameter R<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is set almost equal to the diameter R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is easily inserted from the vehicle outer side B of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The maximum diameter of the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is set equal to the maximum diameter R<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and set larger than the diameter R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (the diameter of the vehicle outer side B end portion). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> However, the main body <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> formed integrally with the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is formed annularly and narrowly, so that the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is deformed and enters the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by forcing the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to be pressed into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> from the vehicle outer side B. By further pressing, the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is bent toward the main body <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to reduce the diameter thereof so that the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In addition, in case of that the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is attached to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, the diameter of the overall anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is slightly enlarged. At this moment, the end portion of the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is engaged with the vehicle inner-side engagement surface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and the end portion of the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is engaged with the vehicle outer-side engagement surface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> from moving in the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> After attaching the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the mounting concave section <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached to the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> using a press-fit tool <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as in the same of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The inside diameter R<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the stabilizing bent section <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is set smaller than the outer peripheral diameter R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, if the stabilizing bent section <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is pressed on the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the end portion of the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is bent and the diameter of the stabilizing bent section <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is enlarged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. As a result, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Further, the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is inserted until the outer ring member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> abuts on the anti-slip piece <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> As described above, the maximum diameter of the attachment deformed section <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is set equal to the maximum diameter R<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and larger than the diameter R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. However, since the main body <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> formed integrally with the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is formed annularly and narrowly, the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by forcing and deforming the supporting bent section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> into the insertion bore <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, possible to form the anti-slip member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> annularly without providing a partial cutoff section for reducing the diameter.

<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible dispense with a locating snap ring for preventing the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from slipping out from the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> toward the vehicle outer side B. It is, therefore, unnecessary to set the width of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> excessively large. In addition, since the vehicle outer side B outside surfaces of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the axle rolling bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be made consistent with the direction of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and located in the same plane in the diameter direction, respectively, it is possible to reduce the size of the knuckle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and thereby improve the degree of freedom of design. </paragraph>
