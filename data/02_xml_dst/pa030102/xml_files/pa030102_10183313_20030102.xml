<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to variable-orientation lighting devices, capable, for example, of equipping motor vehicles. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> When it is desired to orient a lighting device in several non-coplanar directions, for example in elevation and in azimuth, it is possible to mount the lighting system in such a way that it is movable in rotation about two orthogonal axes, and to use two actuators in order to put the lighting system into motion about each of these two axes, so as to be able to direct the light beam generated by the lighting device in all directions, both horizontally and vertically as well as obliquely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Cases do exist, however, in which it is desired that a light beam should be made able to move in two directions, and only in these two directions. Put another way, it is desirable for the light beam emitted by the lighting device to be able to be displaced along two lines, one of these lines being horizontal and the other vertical, for example, any other direction of the light beam not being desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is then known to mount the lighting device on a frame in such a way that it is movable about an axis under the effect of an actuator, then to make the frame movable about a second axis, for example perpendicular to the first one, under the effect of a second actuator. Another known solution consists in assigning a lighting device, movable about a single axis, to each direction in which a movable lighting beam is required. It is therefore necessary to have as many lighting devices as lighting directions. These solutions prove to be expensive due to the multiplication of the headlamps and/or of the actuators which stems from it, and offer bulky, complex and unreliable systems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention lies in this context, and its object is to provide a lighting device with variable orientation along two axes, using only a single actuator to put the lighting device into motion along these two axes, the movements thus achieved having the desired accuracy, the device which causes the movement being reliable in operation, easy to assemble, compact and inexpensive.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF SOME PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the various figures, elements which are identical or which play the same role are allocated the same reference marks, possibly increased by <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> represents a diagrammatic view in perspective of the rear of a variable-orientation lighting device produced according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> By convention, in the present description, &ldquo;forward&rdquo; is the name given to the direction in which the light beam is emitted, and &ldquo;rear&rdquo; the opposite direction. Thus in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> is seen the nonreflecting face of a reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in which a lamp hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been provided for a light source (not represented) to be inserted and held in place. Conventionally, the light rays emitted by the light source are reflected by the reflecting face of the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in order to form a light beam. Depending on the geometry of the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and, if appropriate, on the optical configurations provided on enclosing glazing (not represented) of the lighting device, the light beam will have a predetermined photometry and spatial distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is held in position by three non-aligned points. According to the present invention, the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted on a chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by way of a fixed point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the ball-joint articulation type. Such a ball-joint articulation may, for example, include a shank <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, integral with the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and trapping a ball joint X formed at the extremity of a rod <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, integral with the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Needless to say, the rod <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> could be integral with the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the shank <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> integral with the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed with a second shank <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, trapping a ball joint Y formed at the extremity of a rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> capable of sliding in an aperture <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. More precisely, the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed with two end stops <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) limiting the travel of the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with respect to the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is interposed between the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the rear end stop <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, so as to spring this end stop, and thus the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, rearwards. The shank <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> thus constitute an elastic link from the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> onto the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed with a third shank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, trapping a ball joint Z formed at the extremity of a rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> capable of being put into motion by a linear actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> fixed to the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Finally, the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed with an arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> intended to interact with a housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provided in a part <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For preference, the arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is cylindrical, and the housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> features a semi-cylindrical concave bottom with a radius of curvature substantially equal to the radius of the arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> On reading the foregoing, it will have been understood how the invention can be implemented. In a first position of the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> occupies an extreme rear position. In this position, the arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is at a distance from the housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also occupies its rear rest position, under the action of the spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the end stop <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> being in contact with the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The reflector then projects a light beam in a first direction, when the light source is lit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is driven, it puts the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> into forward motion, in the direction of the arrow A. In this movement, the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, by way of its end ball joint Z, drives the shank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> forwards. With the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> still being sprung, at the end stop, rearwards in the direction of the arrow B by the spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then performs a rotational movement about a first axis passing through the centre of the ball joints X and Y, in the direction of the arrow C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this movement, the light beam emitted by the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is displaced along a first line perpendicular to the first axis X-Y, for example a horizontal line from left to right. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> This rotational movement of the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is continued until the arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comes into abutment on the far end of the housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, provision can be made for the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be formed with two parallel wings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, only one having been represented in dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for the clarity of the drawing, so as to guide the arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in its movement towards the housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The two wings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> can be joined together rearwards in order to prevent the arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> leaving the space which they define between them under the effect of the vibration to which the motor vehicle is subjected while it is in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then lies in an intermediate position. If the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> carries on with its forward movement, it then causes the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be put into motion, which, in its turn, is displaced forwards, compressing the spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then performs a rotational movement about a second axis passing through the centre of the ball joint X and through the axis of the arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> coinciding with the axis of the housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, in the direction of the arrow D in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the axis of the semi-cylindrical housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, formed in the part <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, would be oriented in such a way as to pass through the centre of the ball joint X, formed at the extremity of the rod <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is integral with the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In a variant, as has been represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it would be possible to provide for the arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be formed with a projection <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the pointed extremity of which would be accommodated in a conical housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would then perform a rotational movement about a second axis passing through the centre of the ball joint X and through the vertex of the conical housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In this movement, the light beam emitted by the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is displaced along a second line perpendicular to the second axis X-<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, for example a rising vertical line. This movement may be continued until the end stop <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or onto an end stop formed on it and provided for this purpose. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then lies in a second, extreme forward position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is driven so that the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> comes backwards again, the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> then brings the shank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> back rearwards, while the spring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also springs the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rearwards, and thus the shank <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then performs a rotational movement about the axis X-<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, in the direction counter to that of the arrow D in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this movement, the light beam emitted by the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is displaced along the second line perpendicular to the second axis X-<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, for example a downwards vertical line. This movement is continued until the end stop <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or onto an end stop formed on it and provided for this purpose. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then again lies in the intermediate position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> carries on with its rearwards movement, it then causes a separation between the arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or the projection <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then performs a rotational movement about the first axis, passing through the centre of the ball joints X and Y in the direction contrary to that of the arrow C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this movement, the light beam emitted by the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is displaced along the first line perpendicular to the first axis X-Y, for example a horizontal line from right to left, until it regains the first extreme position represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Hence, according to the present invention, a lighting device with variable orientation along two axes has actually been produced, which uses only a single actuator in order to put the lighting device into motion along these two axes. The movements of the light beam thus implemented can be of any predetermined amplitude, along the first line by arranging the third shank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> nearer to or further from the axis X-Y, and/or along the second line by arranging the third shank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> nearer to or further from the axis X-<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It would also be possible to make provision to set the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> into motion other than by a linear actuator, for example using a stepper motor, the rotary output shaft of which would be equipped with a pinion meshing with a rack gear formed on the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, or else a motor the output shaft of which would be shaped as a worm screw, interacting with a nut integral with the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It would thus be possible to control the movements of the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to orient the light beam in different directions. It would be possible, for example, to provide for the intermediate position to be the position of rest of the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and hence of the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and, in this position, for the beam emitted to be a fog lamp beam. If, from the intermediate position, the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is driven forwards, the light beam is raised, and may come to supplement the beam of a main headlamp. Conversely, if, from the intermediate position, the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is driven rearwards, the light beam is oriented laterally, leftwards in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, and may come to illuminate the areas outside the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, for example areas situated within a turn which the vehicle is on the point of entering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> According to another application example, it would be possible to provide for the second position, in which the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is in its extreme forward position, to be the position of rest of the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and, in this position, for the light beam emitted to be a main headlamp beam, and for the first position, in which the rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is in its extreme rear position, to be a position intended to illuminate areas situated within a turn which the vehicle is on the point of entering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It would also be possible to provide for the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> itself to be able to be oriented, in elevation and in azimuth, for example by way of shanks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, so as to adjust the orientation of the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the use of electric or manual actuators (not represented) and to make the light beam comply with the regulations, for example in the intermediate position if that is the rest position and for the beam emitted to be a fog lamp beam, or in the extreme forward position if that corresponds to a mean headlamp beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> represents a second embodiment of the present invention. According to this embodiment, the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted on a chassis <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> by way of a fixed point <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the ball-joint-articulation type. Such a ball-joint articulation may, for example, include a shank <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, integral with the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, trapping a ball joint X&prime; formed at the extremity of a rod <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, integral with the chassis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Needless to say, the rod <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> could be integral with the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the shank <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> integral with the chassis <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is integral with a shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, passing through an oblong cavity <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> formed in the chassis <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and integral with a toothed sector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The toothed sector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> includes a circular part <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A, and a straight-line part <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>B (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the shank <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are aligned, as has been represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in such a way that the line joining them forms an axis substantially perpendicular to the optical axis of the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and passing through this optical axis. The toothed sector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> meshes with a pinion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, capable of being put into rotational movement by a rotary actuator <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In a variant, as has been represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the toothed sector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> meshes with a rack gear <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, capable of being put into translational movement by a linear actuator (not represented). According to this variant, the toothed sector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is circular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The pinion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> or the actuator <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> have a rotational axis which is fixed with respect to the chassis <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. To that end, provision can be made for the axis <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> linking them to be held, so as to rotate, in a bore <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the chassis. In a variant, the rack gear <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is capable of being driven in translational movement along a fixed direction with respect to the chassis <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Provision could then be made for the side of the rack gear <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> opposite the one which meshes with the toothed sector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to bear on one or more end stops <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> integral with the chassis <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, as has been represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As can be seen better in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> integral with the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is accommodated in the oblong cavity <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the chassis, while being capable of sliding in this cavity. The shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is subjected to the action of a compression spring <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, springing the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> rearwards, and allowing the rotational movements of the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> on itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Finally, as in the preceding embodiment, the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed with an arm <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> intended to interact with a housing <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> provided in a part <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The arm <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is preferably cylindrical, and the housing <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> preferably exhibits a semi-cylindrical concave far end with radius of curvature substantially equal to the radius of the arm <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In a first position of the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which is represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the toothed sector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, integral with the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, occupies an extreme angular position, in which the arm <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is at a distance from the housing <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> likewise occupies its rear, rest position in the cavity <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, under the action of the spring <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The reflector, when the light source is lit, then projects a light beam in a first direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the actuator <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is driven, it puts the pinion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the pinion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> into rotation, the latter turning in the direction of the arrow A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. In this movement, the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, integral with the pinion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and with the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, entrains the latter in a rotational movement about a first axis passing through the centre of the ball joint X&prime; and the far end of the cavity <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, in the direction of the arrow C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In this movement, the light beam emitted by the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is displaced along a first line perpendicular to this first axis, for example a horizontal line from left to right. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> This rotational movement of the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> carries on until the arm <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> comes into abutment on the far end of the housing <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. According to this embodiment, it is not necessary to provide parts for guiding the movements of the arm <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, since its position is determined by the walls of the cavity <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, by the shank <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and by the angular position of the pinion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then lies in an intermediate position. If the pinion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is driven further in rotation in the direction of the arrow A, it then meshes with the straight-line part <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>B of the toothed sector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and thus causes the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to be put into motion, which is displaced then in its turn forwards in the cavity <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, compressing the spring <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then performs a rotational movement about a second axis passing through the centre of the ball joint X&prime; and through the axis of the arm <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> coinciding with the axis of the housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, in the direction of the arrow D in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the axis of the semi-cylindrical housing <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, formed in the part <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, would be oriented in such a way as to pass through the centre of the ball joint X&prime;, formed at the extremity of the rod <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> integral with the chassis <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In a variant, it would be possible, as in the preceding embodiment, to provide for the arm <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to be formed with a projection <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> the pointed extremity of which would be accommodated in a conical housing <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would then carry out a rotational movement about a second axis passing through the centre of the ball joint X&prime; and through the vertex of the conical housing <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In this movement, the light beam emitted by the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is displaced along a second line perpendicular to the second axis X&prime;-<highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, for example a rising vertical line. This movement can be continued until the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> arrives at the end stop in the far end of the cavity <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, or on an end stop (not represented) formed in it. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then lies in a second extreme forward position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> When the pinion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is driven in the direction opposite to that of the arrow A, the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> then brings the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> back rearwards by way of the straight-line part <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>B of the toothed sector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the spring <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> springing the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> rearwards. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thus performs a rotational movement about the axis X&prime;-<highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, in the direction opposite to that of the arrow D in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In this movement, the light beam emitted by the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is displaced along the second line perpendicular to the second axis X&prime;-<highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, for example a downwards vertical line. This movement carries on until the shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> comes back to the far end of the cavity <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then again lies in the intermediate position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> If the pinion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> carries on with its rotational movement in the direction opposite to that of the arrow A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it then meshes with the circular part <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A of the toothed sector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and then causes separation between the arm <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> or the projection <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then carries out a rotational movement about the first axis in the direction opposite to that of the arrow C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In this movement, the light beam emitted by the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is displaced along the first line perpendicular to the first axis, for example a horizontal line from right to left, until it regains the first, extreme position represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Hence according to the present invention a lighting device with variable orientation along two axes has actually been produced, which uses only a single actuator to put the lighting device into movement along these two axes. The movements of the light beam thus caused may be of any predetermined amplitude with the desired precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> It would also be possible to provide for the chassis <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> itself to be able to be oriented, in elevation and in azimuth, so as to adjust the orientation of the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the use of electric or manual actuators and to make the light beam comply with the regulations, for example in the intermediate position if that is the rest position, and for the beam emitted to be a fog lamp beam, or in the extreme forward position if that corresponds to a main headlamp beam. </paragraph>
