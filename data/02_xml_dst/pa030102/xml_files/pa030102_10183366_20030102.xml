<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An optical fiber amplifier is an optical component for amplifying the power of signal light propagating through an optical fiber transmission line constituting an optical transmission system so as to compensate for the transmission loss occurring in the optical fiber transmission line. The optical fiber amplifier placed on the optical fiber transmission line comprises an optical fiber for optical amplification also functioning as a part of the optical fiber transmission line, and a pumping light source for supplying the optical fiber for optical amplification with pumping light.

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The inventors studied conventional Raman amplifiers in detail and, as a result, have found problems as will be explained hereinafter. Among the conventional optical fiber amplifiers, Raman amplifiers are advantageous in that they can utilize a given wavelength band as their amplification wavelength band by appropriately selecting the wavelength band of pumping light. Also, when a pumping light source unit comprising a plurality of pumping light sources outputting a plurality of channels of pumping light having respective wavelengths different from each other is utilized, signal light amplification is possible in an amplification wavelength band wider than that determined by the plurality of channels of pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Here, for realizing a Raman amplifier having a wider amplification wavelength band by employing a pumping light source unit including a plurality of pumping light sources, it becomes necessary to flatten the gain spectrum (wavelength dependence of gain in the amplification wavelength band or the power spectrum of amplified signal light (wavelength dependence of output signal light power) in general. For this matter, U.S. Pat. No. 6,115,174 discloses a Raman amplifier employing a plurality of pumping light sources. In this Raman amplifier, the wavelength and power of pumping light supplied from each pumping light source are set such that the power spectrum of output signal light is substantially flattened within the amplification wavelength band. When the pumping light power in each pumping light source is adjusted as such, the pumping light spectrum in all the pumping channels is regulated, which makes it possible to control the power spectrum of output signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, such a configuration in which the pumping light spectrum in all the pumping channels is adjusted by the pumping light power alone may fail to control the pumping light spectrum and its corresponding output signal light spectrum sufficiently. For example, when the output signal light spectrum within the amplification wavelength band changes greatly, conventional Raman amplifiers may fail to adjust the output signal light spectrum sufficiently so as to make it respond to such a change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Also, the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-208840 discloses a structure that an optical multiplexer multiplexing light from a plurality of pumping light sources and a plurality of optical reflector provided so as to correspond to these pumping light sources are made of materials each having an approximately same differential coefficient of it&apos;s center wavelength change with respect to a temperature change in a wavelength band in use, and that the optimum wavelength of each input port of the optical multiplexer is approximately equal to the center reflection wavelength of the optical reflector at a predetermined temperature within a temperature range in use environment. In the above-mentioned structure, both optimum wavelengths of the optical reflector and the optical multiplexer similarly change with respect to the change of environment temperature. As a result, though a transmission loss and a power of pumping light can be maintain at a constant level, the wavelength shift of gain spectrum occurs in a Raman amplifier depending on a wavelength of pumping light because the change of wavelength is permitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome the above-mentioned problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pumping light source unit comprising a structure for improving the controllability of pumping light spectrum so that the output signal light spectrum within the amplification wavelength band in a Raman amplifier can sufficiently be adjusted, a Raman amplifier including the pumping light source, and an optical transmission system including the Raman amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The pumping light source unit according to the present invention is a pumping light source unit for Raman amplification employed as a light source for supplying a Raman amplifier with N (&gE;2) channels of pumping light having respective wavelengths different from each other. The pumping light source unit comprises N pumping light sources, a pumping light multiplexer, and an output structure. The N pumping light sources output N channels of pumping light having respective wavelengths different from each other. The pumping light multiplexer multiplexes the N channels of pumping light respectively outputted from the N pumping light sources. The output structure supplies a Raman amplification optical fiber with the pumping light multiplexed by the multiplexer. In particular, in the pumping light source unit according to the present invention according to the present invention, at least one of the N pumping light sources includes a wavelength variable pumping light source adapted to change a channel wavelength of pumping light outputted therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The pumping light source unit functioning as pumping light supplying means in the Raman amplifier comprises N pumping light sources for respectively outputting a plurality of channels of pumping light, whereas at least one of the pumping light sources includes a wavelength variable pumping light source. Such a configuration makes it possible to adjust not only the pumping light power of each channel but also the channel wavelength outputted from the wavelength variable light source as necessary, when adjusting the spectrum of pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit. This realizes a pumping light source unit whose pumping light spectrum controllability is improved so as to be able to respond sufficiently to various changes including those in cases where the pumping light spectrum greatly changes in all the channels of pumping light outputted therefrom. Also, when such a pumping light source unit is employed in a Raman amplifier, the power spectrum of output signal within the amplification wavelength band in the Raman amplifier can fully be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The wavelength variable pumping light source adapted to control the channel wavelength of pumping light outputted therefrom comprises a pumping laser, a resonance grating, and a channel wavelength adjusting system. The resonance grating reflects the light outputted from the pumping laser toward the pumping laser. The channel wavelength adjusting system adjusts the reflection wavelength of the resonance grating. An external resonator type laser unit utilizing a resonance grating disposed outside the pumping laser as such can efficiently control the channel wavelength of output pumping light by adjusting the reflection wavelength of the resonance grating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, in the external resonator type mentioned above, the resonance grating is a Bragg grating reflecting light having a Bragg wavelength. A specific example of Bragg grating employable is a fiber Bragg grating in which a periodic refractive index change is formed within at least a core region of an optical fiber along a longitudinal direction thereof. In a simple structure, such a fiber grating can realize both a configuration of external resonance in a wavelength variable laser unit and a configuration of optical waveguide for outputting pumping light from the wavelength variable laser unit to a pumping light multiplexer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The channel wavelength adjusting system for adjusting the reflection wavelength of the fiber Bragg grating includes stress applying means and heating means. The stress applying means applies a predetermined stress to the fiber Bragg grating, so as to change the grating period, thereby adjusting the wavelength of reflected light. The heating means heats the fiber Bragg grating, so as to change the refractive index of the core region part formed with the Bragg grating, thereby adjusting the wavelength of reflected light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> When the Bragg grating is formed within an optical waveguide made of a material having an electrooptic effect, the channel wavelength adjusting system may include electric field applying means. The electric field applying means applies an electric field having a predetermined intensity to the optical waveguide formed with the Bragg grating, thereby changing the refractive index of optical waveguide. In a simple configuration, such a channel wavelength adjusting system can realize both a configuration of external resonance in a wavelength variable laser unit and a configuration of optical waveguide for outputting pumping light from the wavelength variable laser unit to a pumping light multiplexer as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The wavelength variable pumping light source may comprise a semiconductor laser, and heating means for changing an oscillating wavelength of the semiconductor laser by adjusting a chip temperature of the semiconductor laser. Alternatively, the wavelength variable pumping light source may include a wavelength variable laser unit comprising a pumping laser and a variable length bandpass filter adapted to change a wavelength of light transmitted therethrough. Each of these configurations can efficiently control the channel wavelength of output pumping light as with the external resonator type wavelength variable laser utilizing the resonance grating mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The pumping light multiplexer may include transmission characteristic adjusting means for adjusting a transmission wavelength characteristic thereof. As a consequence, even when the channel wavelength of pumping light from each pumping light source to be multiplexed by the pumping light multiplexer changes, the transmission characteristic in the pumping light multiplexer can be adjusted in response to the change in wavelength, whereby each channel of the pumping light can be multiplexed appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For example, the pumping light multiplexer can be constituted by a plurality of polarization multiplexers each polarization-multiplexing a pair of channels of pumping light having respective wavelengths adjacent each other, and a wavelength multiplexer for wavelength-multiplexing a plurality of pumping light components outputted from the respective polarization multiplexers. Employing a polarization multiplexer in a pumping light multiplexer as such makes it unnecessary to adjust transmission characteristics even when the channel wavelength of pumping light changes upon polarization-multiplexing the pumping light. Therefore, pumping light can easily be multiplexed by combining a polarization multiplexer and a wavelength multiplexer together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Preferably, thus configured pumping light multiplexer further comprises a depolarizer disposed between the polarization multiplexer and the wavelength multiplexer. Providing a depolarizer as such reduces the influence of polarization dependence of amplification gain in Raman amplification when the pumping light source is employed in a Raman amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Further, the pumping light multiplexer may include an arrayed waveguide grating, an interleaver, or a combination thereof. When constituted by an arrayed waveguide grating or interleaver, the pumping light multiplexer can favorably respond to channel wavelength changes in pumping light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each of the N pumping light sources includes an external resonator type laser unit comprising a pumping laser and a resonance grating, whereas at least one of the N external resonator type laser units is an external resonator type wavelength variable laser unit further comprising a channel wavelength adjusting system for changing a reflection wavelength of the resonance grating. Here, the pumping light multiplexer preferably comprises at least one optical circulator device and a reflection grating. The optical circulator device multiplexes respective pumping light components outputted from the N external resonator type laser units. Each of the reflection gratings is placed between the resonance grating and optical circulator device in its corresponding external resonator type laser unit. Each-of these reflection gratings has a reflection characteristic of reflecting a respective channel of pumping light outputted from the optical circulator device to the resonance grating toward the optical circulator device. A configuration employing an optical circulator device as such can also multiplex pumping light components from a plurality of pumping light sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the pumping light multiplexer employing the optical circulator device may include (N&minus;1) 3-port optical circulators connected in (N&minus;1) stages so as to successively multiplex N channels of pumping light respectively outputted from the N external resonator type laser units. Alternatively, the pumping light multiplexer may include a single (N&plus;1)-port optical circulator for multiplexing N channels of pumping light respectively outputted from the N external resonator type laser units. Further, the pumping light multiplexer may include a single (N&plus;2)-port optical circulator for multiplexing N channels of pumping light respectively outputted from the N external resonator type laser units. In this case, return light caused by Rayleigh scattering and the like occurring within the Raman amplification optical fiber can effectively be blocked, and the output of each of the N pumping light sources can be stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The pumping light multiplexer may further comprise an optical isolator disposed between the resonance grating and reflection grating in each of the N external resonator type laser units. As a consequence, a plurality of wavelengths of light are prevented from externally resonating in the external resonator type laser units under the influence of reflection gratings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The channel wavelength adjusting system changes the reflection wavelength of the reflection grating for reflecting the pumping light from its corresponding external resonator type wavelength variable laser unit in synchronization with the reflection wavelength of the resonance grating in the corresponding external resonator type wavelength variable laser unit. As a consequence, even when the channel wavelength of pumping light outputted from the external resonator type wavelength variable laser unit changes, the pumping light can reliably be reflected in the corresponding reflection grating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferably, in the pumping light multiplexer employing the optical circulator device, the resonance grating and reflection grating include a Bragg grating for reflecting light having a Bragg wavelength. Specifically, it is preferred that the Bragg grating include a fiber Bragg grating in which a periodic refractive index change is formed within at least a core region of an optical fiber along a longitudinal direction thereof. While the reflection wavelength of the fiber Bragg grating is changed in the channel wavelength adjusting system, the reflection wavelength adjusting system includes stress applying means, heating means, or electric field applying means. The stress applying means changes the grating period by applying a predetermined stress to the fiber Bragg grating. The heating means changes the refractive index within the core region by heating the fiber Bragg grating. When the Bragg grating is formed within an optical waveguide made of a material having an electrooptic effect, the electric field applying means as the channel wavelength adjusting system changes the refractive index of the optical waveguide by applying an electric field having a predetermined intensity to the optical waveguide formed with the Bragg grating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> For outputting the pumping light multiplexed by the pumping light multiplexer to an optical transmission line propagating signal light to be Raman-amplified, the above-mentioned output structure includes an output multiplexer for multiplexing the pumping light with signal light. Such an output multiplexer may be configured so as to connect an output optical fiber of the pumping light source unit to the multiplexer disposed on the optical transmission line side, instead of being provided on the pumping light source unit side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned structure adjusting a pumping light spectrum by changing channel wavelengths of the remaining pumping light sources in order to maintain the flatness of a power spectrum (gain spectrum of Raman amplifier) even when the output of one of the plurality of pumping light sources remarkably decreases, the degradation of pumping light spectrum can not be prevented to a certain level. Thus, the pumping light source unit according to the present invention preferably comprises a main pumping light supply system outputting a plurality of channels of pumping light under steady condition, and a backup pumping light supply system for preventing a degradation of pumping light spectrum caused by the output decrease of any one of the pumping light sources included in the main pumping light supply system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Namely, the pumping light source unit comprises a main pumping light supply system, a multiplexer, an output structure, a backup pumping light supply system and an optical switch. The main pumping light supply system includes N (&gE;2) pumping light sources for outputting N channels of pumping light having respective wavelengths different from each other. The multiplexer multiplexes the N channels of pumping light respectively outputted from the N pumping light sources. The output structure outputs the pumping light multiplexed by the multiplexer. The backup pumping light supply system includes one or more backup pumping light sources, and at least one of the backup pumping light sources is a wavelength variable pumping light source adapted to change a channel wavelength of pumping light outputted therefrom. The optical switch is arranged on an optical path between the main pumping light supply system and the multiplexer. When the output from one of N pumping light sources in the main pumping light supply system decreases, the optical switch functions so as to switch between the output from the one of the N pumping light sources and the output from the associated one of the backup pumping light sources in the backup pumping light supply system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As described above, the pumping light sources according to the present invention comprises the main pumping light supply system and the backup pumping light supply system, and the optical switch switches between these systems. By this structure, the channel wavelengths included in pumping light supplied to the Raman amplifier are maintained under emergency condition that one of the N pumping light sources is failed, and therefore the effect against the gain spectrum of Raman amplifier is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the optical switch includes a switch using an optic intermerometric effect to prevent an instant breaking of pumping light to be introduced to the multiplexer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The pumping light source unit preferably comprises a 1&times;M (&gE;2)-port optical switch arranged on an optical path between the optical switch and the backup pumping light supply system in order to improving a cost performance by reducing the number of the backup pumping light sources included in the backup pumping light supply system. Also, the pumping light source unit preferably comprises a M (&gE;2)-port output demultiplexer arranged on the optical path between the optical switch and the backup pumping light supply system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Further, the pumping light source unit preferably comprises a resonance grating arranged on an optical path between the optical switch and the 1&times;M-port optical switch. The resonance grating has a centrer reflection wavelength being approximately equal to the wavelength of the pumping light outputted from a pumping light source to be switched by the optical switch within the N pumping light sources. Because a reliability degradation generated in a conventional wavelength variable systems can be prevented by this structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The pumping light source unit may further comprises a channel wavelength adjusting system for chang0ing a wavelength of light reflected by the resonance grating, and in this case, the number of the backup pumping light sources can be effectively reduced. The channel wavelength adjusting system may include stress applying means for changing a grating period by applying a predetermined stress to the resonance grating. The channel wavelength adjusting system may include heating means for changing a refractive index within the core region by heating the resonance grating. When the resonance grating is formed within an optical waveguide made of a material having an electrooptic effect, the channel wavelength adjusting system may include electric field applying means for changing a refractive index of the optical waveguide by applying an electric field having a predetermined intensity to the optical waveguide formed with the resonance grating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The Raman amplifier according to the present invention comprises a Raman amplification optical fiber and a pumping light source unit having one of the structures mentioned above. The Raman amplification optical fiber Raman-amplifies signal light within a predetermined amplification wavelength band when pumping light for Raman amplification is supplied thereto. The pumping light source unit supplies the pumping light to the Raman amplification optical fiber. This configuration makes it possible to sufficiently regulate an output signal light spectrum within the amplification wavelength band. This realizes a Raman amplifier whose amplification gain controllability is improved so as to be able to respond sufficiently to various changes including those in cases where the output signal light spectrum greatly changes in the amplification wavelength band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the Raman amplifier comprises an input power measuring system for measuring the power of input signal light, and a controller. According to a result of measurement effected by the input power measuring system, the controller controls a power or wavelength of N channels of pumping light respectively outputted from N pumping light sources included in the pumping light source unit so as to attain a substantially flat output signal light spectrum. Alternatively, the Raman amplifier may comprise an output power measuring system for measuring the power of Raman-amplified output signal light, and a controller. In this case, according to a result of measurement effected by the output power measuring system, the controller controls a power or wavelength of N channels of pumping light respectively outputted from N pumping light sources included in the pumping light source unit so as to attain a substantially flat output signal light spectrum. Also, the Raman amplifier may comprise an instruction signal input system for introducing an instruction signal from outside, and a controller. In this configuration, according to the instruction signal introduced from the instruction signal input system, the controller controls the power or wavelength of pumping light outputted from each of N pumping light sources included in the pumping light source unit so as to attain a substantially flat output signal light spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When the pumping light output is controlled according to a result of measurement of input signal light power, a result of measurement of output signal light power, or a control instruction based on the instruction signal as such, the pumping light spectrum of all the channels supplied from the pumping light source unit and the power spectrum of signal light outputted from the Raman amplifier can be controlled appropriately according to the state of signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As a specific control method, the controller controls a power or wavelength of pumping light so as to attain a substantially flat output signal light spectrum. Preferably, at least one of channel wavelengths of pumping light is controlled such that a frequency yielding the lowest signal light power in the output signal light spectrum approaches a frequency higher by 13 THz to 15 THz than the former frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably, when the power of pumping light outputted from at least one of N pumping light sources included in the pumping light source unit decreases to a level failing to contribute to Raman amplification, the controller controls the power of pumping light outputted from a pumping light source other than the power-decreased pumping light source so as to attain a power fluctuation of 2 dB or less per channel of Raman-amplified signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission system according to the present invention comprises a plurality of relay sections, whereas an average fluctuation of output signal light power is 2 dB or less per relay section. Such an optical transmission system is constituted by six relay sections in general. Taking account of the fact that the optical power receivable by an avalanche photodiode utilized in a receiver has a dynamic range of about &minus;17 to &minus;32 dB, the power fluctuation of output signal light is required to be suppressed to about 2 dB per relay section, about 12 dB in the six relay sections in total. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission system according to the present invention comprises an optical transmission system for propagating signal light within a predetermined signal wavelength band, and a Raman amplifier having one of the structures mentioned above placed at a predetermined position on the optical transmission line. In particular, the Raman amplifier may utilize the optical transmission line as a Raman amplification optical fiber, and comprise a structure for supplying pumping light to the optical transmission line. This realizes an optical transmission system comprising a distributed constant type optical amplifier adapted to control the power spectrum of signal light sufficiently within the signal light wavelength band with respect to the signal light transmitted through an optical transmission line such as an optical fiber transmission line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The Raman amplifier included in the optical transmission system according to the present invention may comprise a Raman amplification optical fiber separate from the optical transmission line. This Raman optical fiber is optically coupled to the optical transmission line, and constitutes a part of the optical transmission line. This realizes an optical transmission system comprising a lumped constant type optical amplifier adapted to control the power spectrum of signal light sufficiently within the signal light wavelength band with respect to the signal light transmitted through an optical transmission line such as an optical fiber transmission line.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the following, embodiments of the pumping light source unit, Raman amplifier, and optical transmission system according to the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B. In the explanation of the drawings, constituents identical to each other will be referred to with numerals identical to each other without repeating their overlapping descriptions. Ratios of dimensions in the drawings do not always match those explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the configuration of a first embodiment of the pumping light source unit according to the present invention. The pumping light source unit LU according to the first embodiment is a light source-unit employed in a Raman amplifier for Raman-amplifying a plurality of channels of signal light (WDM signal) propagating through a Raman amplification optical fiber, and supplies the Raman amplification optical fiber with a plurality of channels of pumping light having respective wavelengths different from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The pumping light source unit LU comprises a pumping light supply system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for supplying a plurality of channels of pumping light, a pumping light multiplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for multiplexing the plurality of channels of pumping light, and an output structure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for outputting thus multiplexed pumping light to an external optical transmission line L. The pumping light supply system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> generating a plurality of channels of pumping light is constituted by a plurality of pumping light sources outputting respective pumping light components having wavelengths different from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pumping light supply system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises four pumping light sources, i.e., a first pumping light-source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for outputting pumping light having a wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, a second pumping light source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for outputting pumping light having a wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(&lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&gt;&lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), a third pumping light source <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for outputting pumping light having a wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(&lgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&gt;&lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), and a fourth pumping light source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for outputting pumping light having a wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(&lgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&gt;&lgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). These pumping light sources are wavelength variable pumping light sources configured such that their outputting wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of pumping light are variably controllable within their predetermined wavelength ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>to &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of pumping light (four-channel pumping light) respectively outputted from the four wavelength variable pumping light sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are multiplexed in the pumping light multiplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so as to become pumping light having a predetermined power spectrum as a whole. Thus multiplexed pumping light is outputted by way of the output structure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the optical transmission line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through which the signal light propagates. The output structure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes an output optical waveguide <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and an output multiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, the pumping light multiplexed by the multiplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the output optical waveguide <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and then is multiplexed by the output multiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with the signal light propagating through the optical transmission line L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The pumping light supply system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the pumping light source unit LU functioning as a pumping light source of the Raman amplifier is constituted by a plurality of pumping light sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> outputting respective channel wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of pumping light. Each of the pumping light sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a wavelength variable pumping light source. This configuration makes it possible to regulate not only the power of each pumping light but also wavelengths of pumping light outputted from the pumping light sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as necessary, when adjusting the whole pumping light spectrum outputted from the pumping light source unit LU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In general, when employing a pumping light source unit constituted by a plurality of pumping light sources in a Raman amplifier, it becomes necessary to flatten the gain spectrum within the amplification wavelength band, which is a wide band, or the power spectrum of output signal light. The power spectrum of signal light outputted from the Raman amplifier subjected to adjustment is determined by the power spectrum of pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit. Therefore, for adjusting the power spectrum of signal light outputted from the Raman amplifier, it is necessary to regulate the power spectrum of pumping light outputted from the pumping light source unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Known as such a method of adjusting the pumping light spectrum is one adjusting the pumping light power of each channel outputted from the respective pumping light source included in the pumping light source. However, such an adjusting method may fail to attain sufficient controllability for the pumping light spectrum. For example, if the power of one of a plurality of pumping light sources included in the pumping light source unit comes down, the power spectrum of output signal light will greatly fall in the vicinity of a signal light wavelength corresponding to the channel wavelength of pumping light supplied by the power-decreased pumping light source. In such a case, the fall in the power spectrum of output signal light may not fully be compensated for even if the power of pumping light supplied by the pumping light sources other than the power-decreased one is adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> By contrast, the pumping light source unit LU comprising a plurality of pumping light sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> each acting as a wavelength variable pumping light source realizes a pumping light source unit LU whose pumping light spectrum controllability is improved so as to be able to respond sufficiently to various changes including those in cases where the pumping light spectrum greatly changes in all the channels of pumping light outputted therefrom. Also, when such a pumping light source unit LU is employed in a Raman amplifier, the power fluctuation of output signal light within the amplification wavelength band in the Raman amplifier can fully be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The pumping light spectrum adjustment and output signal light spectrum flattening in the pumping light source unit LU shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will now be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows power spectra of pumping light source supplied from the pumping light source unit LU shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in which the abscissa indicates the pumping light wavelength &lgr;. At the time when the pumping light source unit LU operates normally, four channels of pumping light having pumping light wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>respectively indicated by broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are supplied from the four wavelength variable pumping light sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Here, suppose that the power of third pumping light source (wavelength variable pumping light source) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the pumping light sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comes down, whereby the wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of pumping light stops being supplied. In this case, the power spectrum of output signal light greatly falls in the vicinity of a signal light wavelength corresponding to the pumping light wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in the Raman amplifier employing this pumping light source unit LU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows output signal light spectra in a Raman amplifier employing the pumping light source unit LU show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in which the abscissa indicates the channel wavelength (nm) of signal light amplified by pumping light.

The Raman amplifier RA according to the first embodiment comprises a Raman amplification optical fiber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a pumping light source unit LU. The pumping light source unit LU is a pumping light source unit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (first embodiment); and comprises four wavelength variable pumping light sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a pumping light multiplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and an output structure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (including an output optical waveguide <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and an output multiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The pumping light source unit LU supplies pumping light to the Raman amplification optical fiber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The pumping light source unit LU is connected to an optical transmission line L within the Raman amplifier RA by way of an output multiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> placed downstream the Raman amplification optical fiber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the signal light propagating direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> The output multiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> sends the pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit LU toward its upstream Raman amplification optical fiber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the direction opposite from the signal light propagating direction. To the downstream side in the forward direction, the output multiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> transmits therethrough signal light having arrived from the Raman amplification optical fiber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, the Raman amplifier RA according to the first embodiment functions as a counterpropagating pumping (backward pumping) optical amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> An optical branching device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is placed at a predetermined position on the optical transmission line L downstream the pumping light source unit LU. The optical branching device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> branches a part of the output signal light forwardly propagating through the optical transmission line L after being amplified by the Raman amplification optical fiber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into an output signal light monitor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (included in an output power measuring system) at a predetermined ratio. The output signal light monitor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is constituted by an optical spectrum analyzer, an optical performance monitor, or the like, and measures a state of output signal such as an output signal light spectrum concerning the output signal from the optical branching device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Results of measurement of output signal light effected by the output signal light monitor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are sent to a controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. According to the results of measurement effected by the output signal light monitor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> controls respective channel powers or channel wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to &lgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of pumping light outputted from a plurality of pumping light sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> included in the pumping light source unit LU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Thus, since the above-mentioned pumping light source unit LU (the pumping light source unit according to the present invention) including wavelength variable pumping light sources is employed in the Raman amplifier RA, output signal light spectra within an amplification wavelength band can fully be adjusted. This realizes the Raman amplifier RA whose amplification gain controllability is improved so as to be able to respond sufficiently to various changes including those in cases where the output signal light spectrum greatly changes due to the power down in any of the pumping light sources <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Also, when the pumping light is controlled according to results of measurement of output signal light, both the power spectrum of the whole pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit LU and the power spectrum of signal light outputted from the Raman amplifier RA are favorably regulated in response to the state of signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Preferably, as a specific method of controlling the pumping light in this case, the controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> controls the individual channel powers or channel wavelengths of pumping light so that the output signal light spectrum becomes substantially flat. As a consequence, the state of signal light transmitted through the optical transmission line L can be held favorably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> controls a channel wavelength of pumping light such that a frequency yielding substantially the lowest signal light power in the output signal light spectrum approaches a frequency higher by 13 THz to 15 THz (corresponding to a wavelength shorter by about 100 nm to 120 nm) than the former frequency. This can enhance the amplification gain in a wavelength band yielding a lower signal light power, thereby efficiently flattening the output signal light spectrum. </paragraph>

The pumping light source unit LU is pumping light supplying means for constituting a Raman amplifier RA for optically amplifying the signal light transmitted through the optical fiber transmission line L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> When the pumping light source unit LU comprises an output multiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the latter functions as the multiplexer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the pumping light source unit LU may be connected to a separate multiplexer disposed on the optical fiber transmission line L side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission system according to the first embodiment is one in which the Raman amplifier RA including the pumping light source unit LU functions as a distributed constant type optical amplifier. In such a distributed constant type optical amplifier RA, the optical fiber constituting a part of the optical fiber transmission line L is utilized as a Raman amplification optical fiber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The optical transmission system according to the second embodiment comprises a transmitting station (transmitter) T for transmitting a plurality of channels of signal light within a predetermined signal light wavelength band, an optical fiber transmission line L which is an optical transmission line for propagating the signal light from the transmitting station T, and a receiving station (receiver) R for receiving the signal light propagated through the optical fiber transmission line L. Also, a relay station S for relaying the signal light propagating through the optical fiber transmission line L is disposed at a predetermined position between the transmitting station T and the receiving station R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> A multiplexer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is disposed at a predetermined position on the optical fiber transmission line L within the relay station S. By way of the multiplexer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the above-mentioned pumping light source unit (pumping light source unit according to the present invention) is optically coupled to the optical fiber transmission line L. To the upstream side in the direction opposite from the signal propagating direction, the multiplexer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> sends the pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit LU. The pumping light source unit LU is pumping light supplying means for constituting a Raman amplifier RA for optically amplifying the signal light transmitted through the optical fiber transmission line L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission system according to the second embodiment is one in which the Raman amplifier RA including the pumping light source unit LU functions as a lumped constant type optical amplifier placed within the relay station S. In such a lumped constant type optical amplifier A, a separate optical fiber inserted in the optical fiber transmission line L is utilized as a Raman amplification optical fiber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Placing the lumped constant type Raman amplifier employing the pumping light source unit LU having the above-mentioned configuration at a predetermined position on the optical fiber transmission line L as such can realize an optical transmission system which restrains the transmission quality of signal light from deteriorating, thereby being able to transmit the signal light reliably from the transmitting station T to the receiving station R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the configuration of relay station in the optical transmission system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> In the relay station S, the multiplexer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is disposed at a predetermined position on the optical fiber transmission line L, whereas the pumping light source unit LU is optically coupled to the optical fiber transmission line L by way of the multiplexer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Also, a dispersion-compensating module DM having a dispersion-compensating fiber (DCF) for compensating for the dispersion generated in signal light while being transmitted through the optical fiber transmission line L is disposed within the relay station S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> In the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, the multiplexer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and pumping light source unit LU are placed downstream the dispersion-compensating module DM. This configuration is one in which the dispersion-compensating fiber included in the dispersion-compensating module DM is utilized as the Raman amplification optical fiber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Namely, byway of the multiplexer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit LU is sent to the optical fiber transmission line L in the direction opposite from the signal light propagating direction. Thus sent pumping light is supplied to the optical fiber within the dispersion-compensating module DM acting as the Raman amplification optical fiber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, the lumped constant type Raman amplifier RA for amplifying the signal light is constructed within the relay station S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Various configurations can be attained within the relay station S without being restricted to an example thereof shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. For example, separately from the optical fibers such as the dispersion-compensating fiber, a dedicated optical fiber for Raman amplification may be utilized for Raman amplification. Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, additional optical amplifiers (e.g., EDFA) Sa, Sb may be provided in addition to the Raman amplifier RA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the configuration of a third embodiment of the optical transmission system according to the present invention. The optical transmission system according to the third embodiment is one in which a plurality of communication users transmit signal light components A, B, C (each being WDM signal light having a plurality of channels) using signal light wavelength bands different from each other by way of the same optical transmission line L. When the above-mentioned Raman amplifier RA (Raman amplifier according to the present invention) is placed on the optical transmission line L in such an optical transmission system, the signal light components A, B, C are amplified favorably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Here, respective signal light wavelength bands of signal light components A, B, C fall within the following wavelength ranges: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> (A) 1530 nm to 1570 nm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> (B) 1535 nm to 1575 nm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> (C) 1540 nm to 1580 nm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> The amplification gain of Raman amplifier RA is controlled so as to flatten the output signal light spectrum in the wavelength band of each signal light component. The pumping light source unit of the Raman amplifier RA has three wavelength variable pumping light sources as a plurality of pumping light sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> First, the flattening of output signal light spectrum for the signal light component B having a medium signal light wavelength band among the three signal light components will be considered. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> shows a power spectrum concerning signal light B after Raman amplification. Here, channel wavelengths of pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit are set to three channels at wavelengths of 1428 nm, 1439 nm, and 1460 nm so as to respond to the signal light wavelength bands of 1535 nm to 1575 nm of signal light B. The setting of these pumping light channels and optimization of their respective powers sufficiently flatten the output signal light spectrum with respect to the wavelength band of signal light B as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Next, the flattening of output signal light spectrum for the signal light component A having a signal wavelength band on the shorter wavelength side will be considered. Each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A and 37B</cross-reference> shows a power spectrum concerning signal light A after Raman amplification. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</cross-reference> shows an output signal light spectrum obtained when three-channel pumping light having pumping light wavelengths 1428 nm, 1439 nm, and 1460 nm set for the signal light B is utilized as it is. In this case, since pumping light channels are not optimized, the spectrum is not sufficiently flattened, whereby the flatness deteriorates on the shorter wavelength side in particular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</cross-reference> shows a power spectrum obtained when pumping light is set to three channels at 1424 nm, 1434 nm, and 1455 nm so as to respond to the signal light wavelength band of 1530 nm to 1570 nm of signal light A. When the individual channel wavelengths of pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit are adjusted optimally as such, the output signal light spectrum can fully be flattened in the wavelength band of signal light A as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Next, the flattening of output signal light spectrum for the signal light component C having a signal wavelength band on the longer wavelength side will be considered. Each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38A and 38B</cross-reference> shows a power spectrum concerning signal light C after Raman amplification. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</cross-reference> shows an output signal light spectrum obtained when three-channel pumping light having pumping light wavelengths 1428 nm, 1439 nm, and 1460 nm set for the signal light B is utilized as it is. In this case, since pumping light channels are not optimized, the spectrum is not sufficiently flattened, whereby the flatness deteriorates on the longer wavelength side in particular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</cross-reference> shows a power spectrum obtained when pumping light is set to three channels at 1432 nm, 1443 nm, and 1464 nm so as to respond to the signal light wavelength band of 1540 nm to 1580 nm of signal light C. When the individual channel wavelengths of pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit are adjusted optimally as such, the output signal light spectrum can fully be flattened in the wavelength band of signal light C as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> As in the foregoing, the optical transmission system employing a pumping light source unit including a wavelength variable pumping light source is also applicable to cases where signal light having a plurality of wavelength bands different from each other (WDM signal light) propagates. Namely, when channel wavelengths of pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit are controlled variably, the amplification wavelength band in which the power spectrum of Raman-amplified output signal light is flattened can be changed in conformity to the wavelength band of signal light to be amplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the above-mentioned Raman amplifier, when placing an optical fiber transmission line including the Raman amplifier or introducing the Raman amplifier into an optical fiber transmission line which has already been placed, channel wavelengths and channel powers of pumping light can be adjusted while measuring the output signal light spectrum, whereby the optical amplification controllability in the Raman amplifier can be improved. Also, as mentioned above, even when any of a plurality of pumping light sources included in the pumping light source unit fails, channel wavelengths of pumping light from the other pumping light sources can be adjusted, so as to compensate for the failed pumping light, thereby keeping the power spectrum of output signal light as flat as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Without being restricted to the above-mentioned embodiments, the pumping light source unit, Raman amplifier, and optical transmission system according to the present invention can be modified in various manners. For example, the number of a plurality of pumping light sources included in the pumping light source unit is not limited to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as in the configuration shown in the above-mentioned embodiments, and the like. The number and configuration thereof are preferably set according to the width of the amplification wavelength band, the controllability of optical amplification gain, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> As in the foregoing, the present invention provides a pumping light source unit in which at least one of a plurality of pumping light sources outputting a plurality of channels of pumping light having respective wavelengths different from each other is a wavelength variable pumping light source, a Raman amplifier employing the same, and an optical transmission system, thereby being able to adjust not only the respective channel powers of pumping light but also the wavelength of pumping light outputted from the wavelength variable pumping light source as necessary when regulating the power spectrum of pumping light supplied from the pumping light source unit and the power spectrum of its corresponding output signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> This realizes a pumping light source unit, a Raman amplifier, and an optical transmission system, whose controllability is improved so as to be able to respond sufficiently to various changes including those in cases where the pumping light spectrum or output signal light spectrum greatly changes. </paragraph>
