<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to magnetic tape cassettes having an easy-to-separate transparent window and processes for producing them. The invention particularly relates to magnetic tape cassettes that have a transparent window formed of a transparent resin (plastic) window member in the upper half of the cassette in such a way that when the cassette is discarded after use, the window member can be easily separated from the opening in the base (the body of the upper half) so that the base and the window member can individually be recovered as recyclable feeds as well as a process for producing the magnetic tape cassettes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to shaped resin articles that are so designed that members of different materials can be easily separated from each other, as exemplified by magnetic tape cassettes which are so designed that the transparent window in the housing (cassette case) through which the user can check the residual amount of tape (visually) is easily separable from the housing (or its base). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a method for multi-color molding of resin products, particularly of magnetic tape cassettes which are so designed that the transparent residual tape check window in the housing (cassette case) is easily separable from the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention further relates to a method for destructing and separating parts made of dissimilar materials which is particularly applicable to the magnetic tape cassette and by which the transparent residual tape check window in the housing (cassette case) of the magnetic tape can be easily separated from the housing which is made of a dissimilar material than the transparent window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As an introduction to the specific description of the invention, magnetic tape cassettes are well known which are of such a type that a web of magnetic tape is wound around a pair of take-up hubs which are rotatably housed in the housing (cassette case). This magnetic tape cassette has a transparent window formed in the upper half so that the user can see through it to check the residual amount of the magnetic tape wound around the right and left take-up hubs. Obviously, in order to eliminate the waste of resources and save them or protect the environment, it is most desirable that the upper half of the magnetic tape cassette, when discarded after use, should be disassembled into its body (base) and the transparent window member so that they can be recycled as new feeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Considering these points, the present invention provides easy-to-disassemble magnetic tape cassettes (or their upper half) and processes for producing them, shaped resin particles such as magnetic tape cassettes, a method for multi-color molding of resin products such as magnetic tape cassettes (or their upper half) and a method for destructing and separating parts of dissimilar materials such as the transparent window and the housing (cassette case) of magnetic tape cassettes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the recent concern over environmental problems, people are worrying about the adverse effects that may be caused to the environment by increased dumping of resins (plastics), composites and other materials. Under the circumstances, reducing the impact on the environment by either minimizing wastes or dumping them in forms that are not deleterious to the purpose of preserving the environment is becoming increasingly important. To this end, efforts are being made to integrate industrial products into the circulating system of the society at large by, for example, ensuring that they can be easily disassembled into various parts by materials type so that the latter can be recycled as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Two types of magnetic tape cassette are known as image recording and reproducing tape cassettes that are used in consumer or professional video tape recorders or video cameras, and also as large-capacity recording media that are used to back up data in external storages in computers and the like; the first type comprises magnetic tape wound around a pair of take-up hubs placed rotatably in a cassette case consisting of an upper half and a lower half (which is hereunder referred to simply as a housing) and the second type comprises magnetic tape wound around a single tape reel also encased rotatably in a housing. Known examples are magnetic tape cassettes the structural and dimensional specifications of which are described in JIS X6127, X6129, X6130, X6171 and X6172, as well as in ECMA-288, etc. Those various types of magnetic tape cassette are designed as complex structures formed of various metallic members in combination with various synthetic resin members depending upon the performance and shapes required of the parts of which they are made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The various types of magnetic tape cassette mentioned above have a window formed in one or more openings in the top plate of the upper half and in order to ensure that the user can externally check the amount, state and other parameters of the magnetic tape that has been taken up by the hubs or the tape reel in the cassette case, the window is formed by fitting a transparent or translucent window member in the opening or openings. The windows are made of various resin materials depending upon the impact strength, wear resistance, durability and other characteristics required of the respective magnetic tape cassettes. For example, window members formed of an AS resin may be fitted in cassette cases formed of an ABS resin; alternatively, all parts including the cassette case and the window member may be formed of a PS resin. Thus, magnetic tape cassettes are made of various resins depending upon the required performance and shapes and are not formed of unified materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A common magnetic tape cassette may diagrammatically be shown in perspective in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference>. As shown, the magnetic tape cassette generally indicated by <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> consists of an upper half <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and a lower half <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that combine to form the cassette case as the housing. A slider <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> is fitted to the underside of the lower half <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and a lid <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is provided at the front face of the cassette (which is closer to the viewer). The slider <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> can slide back and forth on the underside of the lower half <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> so that when the cassette is not in service, the slider prevents dust from getting into the cassette by closing the opening in the lower part of the cassette case. The lid <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> on the upper half <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted on a shaft <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so that it can open or close the front face of the cassette. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The housing of the magnetic tape cassette <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> contains magnetic tape <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> as it is wound around a pair of take-up hubs. The upper half <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> has a transparent window <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> through which the residual amount of tape in the magnetic tape cassette <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be checked as when it has been taken out of the deck (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As already mentioned, the respective parts of the magnetic tape cassette are formed of synthetic resins. Specifically, members that require sliding properties (wear resistance) are molded of POM (polyacetal) resin; if cost performance is important, Si (silicon) is added to PS (polystyrene) to prepare a resin molding material; if strength is an important factor, ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) resin is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Speaking of video cassettes which are generally molded of ABS, the transparent residual tape check window is often molded of ABS-compatible resins such as AS (acrylonitrile-styrene) and PMMA &lsqb;poly(methyl methacrylate)&rsqb;. This is because the window and the cassette case are formed by two-color molding (two-layer molding) and subsequently bonded by welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The molding of the magnetic tape cassette under consideration, especially the molding of the upper half <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and the window <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is conventionally performed as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66A, a</cross-reference> die assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for molding the upper half <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is basically composed of an upper die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a lower die <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a moving (sliding) core <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The upper die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the lower die <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the moving core <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> define a space <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, into which a molten resin &lsqb;e.g. ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) resin&rsqb; is injected to mold the upper half <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference>B, the moving core <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is allowed to descend by a distance equal to the thickness of the window member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>; into the resulting space <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a transparent resin &lsqb;e.g. AS (acrylonitrile-styrene) resin&rsqb; is injected to mold the window member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66A and 66B</cross-reference>, the edges of the moving core <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are cut out at an angle (beveled) so that the area of contact between the window <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the upper half <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is sufficiently increased to achieve more effective bonding of the two components after molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference> shows in perspective the upper half of the cassette case of the prior art magnetic tape cassette with part taken away after it has been cut through the transparent window, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference> is a section of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference> which has been taken through the transparent window. In order to fabricate the upper half <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the conventional cassette case, the body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> serving as the base is first provided; then an opening <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is made in the body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to provide an area in which a transparent window member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can later be fitted and a window frame <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed around the opening <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to support the window member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>; subsequently, the window member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is fitted into the opening <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and welded to the supporting window frame <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by ultrasonic welding or some other method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The method of transparent window fabrication which is illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 67 and 68</cross-reference> is convenient and suitable for mass production of cassette cases. However, if the upper half <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the cassette case discarded after use is to be disassembled into its body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> so that they can be recycled as new feeds, a serious problem arises, i.e., since the transparent window <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is welded to the body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, it is very difficult to disassemble the upper half <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> without breaking either the body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> or the window member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Even if the upper half <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is disassembled by breaking either its body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> or the window member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, it is practically impossible to ensure that both are positively separated from the welded area and part of the window member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> will remain firmly adherent to the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> or vice versa. Under these circumstances, if an attempt is made to recycle the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> as respectively new feeds, the two components inevitably occur as a mixture&mdash;part of the window member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> firmly adheres to the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and part of the body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> firmly adheres to the window member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and it has been unavoidable that the recycled feeds have only low purity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The transparent window as a component of the cassette case is included as part of the upper half <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and must impart air-tightness for dust prevention and other purposes. In addition, the cassette case involves manual handling at various stages of its use including carrying, storage and loading onto the recording and reproducing apparatus and it must have sufficient strength that it will not break or become dislodged during handling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As already mentioned, the conventional magnetic tape cassette molded by the method illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66A and 66B</cross-reference> features a very strong bond between the transparent window and the housing in order to maintain the strength of the cassette case and considerable force is usually required to separate the window from the housing by hand. Because of this strong bond, it has been difficult to achieve selective recovery of dissimilar materials, particularly ABS from AS or PMMA. The high peel strength of the conventional magnetic tape cassette is desirable from the viewpoint of ensuring that it performs the intended functions; however, its shape does not allow easy disassembling into the window and the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if the user attempts to separate the window from the housing by force, he has to break the window but if it does not break easily and neat, he may be hurt by the shattered pieces of window. Simply cutting slits or otherwise rendering the window easily breakable is not capable of producing a sufficiently dust-proof cassette case. The window once bonded firmly to the upper half does not break easily and if it is destroyed by force, it will partly remain adhering to the housing; this is better than what has been attained in the prior art but the separation is by no means complete. If the window is not collected as a separate entity from the housing or if the separation is not complete, the mixing of dissimilar materials makes it difficult to recycle the respective parts and regenerate materials of good quality (this type of recycling is called &ldquo;materials recycling&rdquo;) that sell at competitive price. A need therefore arises to increase the precision in the separation technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Thus, it has been desired to design a magnetic tape cassette that permits easy separation of the window from the housing without compromising the dust-proofness of the cassette case. Common resin products have a similar need and they should desirably be so designed that various parts can be easily collected as separate entities, thereby making more parts recyclable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As already mentioned, there is an increasing demand for designing industrial products that can be manufactured by making effective use of limited resources of the Earth and which can be disposed of in an environment friendly manner. This is one of the reasons why the components or constituent materials of magnetic tape cassettes that find massive use in a wide range of applications are desirably recycled to realize saving of resources and disposed of without increasing the impact on the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Resins of which the magnetic tape cassettes are made can generally be recycled either as members, parts or resin feeds (materials recycling) or as fuels (thermal recycling). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Materials recycling presents no big problems in saving resources and reducing the environmental impact. On the other hand, thermal recycling involves the use of thermal energy and is not effective for preventing global warming since an increasing amount of heat is dissipated to the environment in the recycling process. Therefore, the magnetic tape cassettes are desirably made of members, parts or materials none or only a few of which need be subjected to thermal recycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> From these viewpoints, the window member to be fitted in the upper half of the magnetic tape cassette should desirably satisfy the requirements of the saving resources, conserving the Earth&apos;s environment and not contributing to global warming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been accomplished under these circumstances and its primary objective is to solve the aforementioned problems of the prior art by providing a magnetic tape cassette which, in the case of disassembling a discarded magnetic cassette into the base (the body of the upper half) and the window member and recycling the respective parts as feeds for the manufacture of additional products, can be disassembled in an easy and safest way, preferably easily without breaking, and in an efficient way and which is also characterized in that no part of the window member will remain adhering to the base or vice versa, that the separated base or window member can be recycled as a feed for additional products without suffering a drop in purity, and that it has a transparent window which is sufficiently air-tight and strong to provide it with adequate air-tightness and strength.

<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> First, we refer to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and describe the magnetic tape cassettes according to the fifth aspect of the invention, particularly its first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an exploded perspective view of a magnetic tape cassette with a transparent window according to a first example of the first embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing in section the upper half of the magnetic tape cassette of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as it is cut through the transparent window along line I-I. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a partial section of the upper half shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> are partial enlarged sections showing two examples of the engagement between a first wedge-shaped projection on the body of the upper half (hereunder sometimes referred to as the base) and a second wedge-shaped projection on a window member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The magnetic tape cassette with the transparent window according to the first example of the first embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention is generally indicated by <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As shown, a length of magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is securely attached to a pair of take-up hubs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at its ends and the remainder of tape length is wound around the respective take-up hubs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The pair of take-up hubs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> around which the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been wound is placed rotatably within a cassette case which is the combination of an upper half <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a lower half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is threaded in a specified path to be stretched between the two hubs such that only a portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tape that is in a position which corresponds to the magnetic head on a record/reproduce apparatus (not shown) would otherwise be exposed to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In order to cover and protect the magnetic layer of the portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the magnetic tape which would otherwise become exposed to the outside of the cassette case, the upper half <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fitted with a front cover (lid) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is axially supported by pins <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and capable of pivoting between two positions, the CLOSE position where it covers the portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the magnetic tape and the OPEN position where it lets the portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>become exposed. The lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is urged toward the CLOSE position by means of a torsion coil spring (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The lower half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a rectangular bottom plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which in turn has reel shaft insertion holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the center; the reel shaft insertion holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> rotatably support the pair of take-up hubs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> around which the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been wound; in addition, when the magnetic tape cassette under consideration is loaded in a record/reproduce apparatus (not shown), the reel shafts (also not shown) on the apparatus pass through the holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into the take-up hubs, thereby driving them to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The bottom plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has two forward extensions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the right and left ends. The extensions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> have cylindrical tape guides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> erected vertically on the bottom plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>; the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> stretched between the take-up hubs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is guided by means of the cylindrical tape guides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such that it is threaded in a specified path to reach the front of the cassette case. The bottom plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is cut out in the area between the two extensions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, leaving an opening in the cassette case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Positioning pins (not shown) on the upper half <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are inserted into the tape guides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to achieve registration. The tape guides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also serve as screw bosses through which screws (also not shown) are pushed from below into the threaded holes in the centers of the positioning pins and tightened to hold the upper half <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the lower half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> together in secure position. Screw bosses <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having a similar structure to the tape guides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are provided in the back at right and left corners of the lower half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. By inserting screws into these four bosses and tightening them up, the cassette halves having the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and other components installed therein are securely held together to provide the magnetic tape cassette <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> A slider generally indicated by <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a thin flat bottom plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that is brought into contact with the underside of the bottom plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the lower half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the cassette is not in service, the bottom plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> closes, for dust prevention, the open areas in the underside of the cassette case, namely, the opening in the lower half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the reel shaft insertion holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Being guided by sidewalls <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the lower half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the bottom plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is capable of moving back and forth to slide along the underside of the lower half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. If it moves forward, the bottom plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> closes the opening in the cassette case and the reel shaft insertion holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>; if it moves backward, the bottom plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> clears the opening in the cassette case and, at the same time, the reel shaft insertion holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the lower half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> come into registry with reel shaft insertion holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the slider <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, making the cassette case ready for insertion of the aforementioned reel shafts on the record/reproduce apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The bottom plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the lower half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a mid-wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> curved in arched form along the magnetic tape <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> wound around the take-up hubs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>.

By adopting the design of the third example, the advantages of both the first and second examples are retained and one can fabricate a magnetic tape cassette having a transparent window that has even better fit to the body of the upper half of the cassette. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Described above are the basic features of the design of the magnetic tape cassette according to the first embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> We next describe the magnetic tape cassette according to the first aspect of the invention with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The magnetic tape cassette according to the first aspect of the invention is characterized in that the transparent window is provided in the upper half of the cassette by pressing the window member into the opening in the base (the body of the upper half) at an angle until it is fixed in position. Except for the mechanism by which the window member forming the transparent window in the upper half is fitted into the opening in the body of the upper half and fixed in position, the magnetic tape cassette according to the first aspect of the invention has essentially the same construction as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>; therefore, on the following pages, we describe only this mechanism in detail and omit the description of other parts. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> The window member engaging portion of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> corresponds to the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and in that portion (i.e., around the opening in the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>) are formed engaging grooves <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that come into engagement with the engaging members <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, as well as stepped portions <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that correspond to the stepped portions <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The engaging members <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>engage the engaging grooves <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the stepped portions <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>come into engagement with the stepped portions <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, thereby achieving effective engagement between the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> while securing against the entrance of dust into the upper half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> The mechanism for achieving engagement between the window member engaging portion and the window member that are respectively shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> is such that the engaging members <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> are slid along the inner surfaces of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> into the engaging grooves <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the window member engaging portion shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, with the angles of inclination being in registry, and a force is applied in the same direction, whereupon the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is brought into engagement with the window member engaging portion of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. As will be described later, at the final stage of this engaging action, the stepped portions <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> will fit to the stepped portions <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the window member engaging portion of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> in a substantially vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The above-described action for engaging the window member in the example under consideration may be regarded as consisting of two stages and in spite of the relatively easy fitting action, the window member engaging portion can realize a strong enough fit and, in addition, in order to separate the window member from the upper half, the user must first apply a vertical force to cancel the engagement between the stepped portions and only thereafter does he cancel the engaging members and the engaging grooves by applying a force at a specified angle. This is indeed a measure that secures utmost safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> A more specific description is given below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> which shows in section the engagement between the window member engaging portion of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> as it is cut through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> along the imaginary line II-II.

<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> As already mentioned, it is basically at a specified angle that the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> can be removed from the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> (particularly from the window member engaging portion). However, the horizontal component of a force applied at an angle is constrained by the above-mentioned abutting sides, so the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> must first be depressed in a vertical direction from the outer surface of the upper half (from below in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) in order to remove the constraint and then a force is applied at the specified angle in order to remove the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> from the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> The magnetic tape cassette according to the first aspect of the invention has the above-described construction, so when it is in service, the engaging members <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> remain in engagement with the engaging grooves <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the inner surfaces of the opening in the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, the stepped portions <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the inner surfaces of the opening in the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> are in intimate contact with the stepped portions <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and no practical problems will occur in terms of joint strength and air-tightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> In the examples shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, the angle at which the engaging members <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> engage the engaging grooves <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the inner surfaces of the opening in the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is not given an exact definition but a preferred range is typically from about 10 to 45 degrees with the normal. The direction of inclination is preferably parallel to a longitudinal direction of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows further details of the engaging grooves <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the window member engaging portion of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> according the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. As shown, the entrance <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ab </italic></highlight>of each engaging groove <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(on the right side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) is preferably shaped to have a somewhat gentle lead so that the engaging member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> can be easily inserted. Conversely, the exit <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>aa </italic></highlight>of each engaging groove <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(on the left side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) is preferably shaped to maintain a predetermined sharp angle so that the inserted engaging member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will not be easily dislodged under a depressing force applied from a near-vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</cross-reference> are sectional views showing details of another example of the engaging grooves <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the window member engaging portion of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. The shape of the engaging groove shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference> is effective in the case of using an engaging member of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</cross-reference> which has a generally circular cross section, namely, one having a short length in the direction in which it is to be fitted in. After the engaging member is fitted at a specified angle into the groove <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A, the window member is preferably moved downward by a small amount in the vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> The shape of the engaging groove shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference> is also effective in the case of using an engaging member having a short length in the direction in which it is to be fitted in. Preferably, the engaging member is first moved downward vertically by a small amount and then it is fitted into the groove <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at a specified angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The engaging grooves <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the window member engaging portion may adopt various other shapes including the combination of the shapes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows still another example of the shape of the engaging groove <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the window member engaging portion of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and the nearby area. In the example shown, the exit <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>aa </italic></highlight>of each engaging groove <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is further extended to form an extension <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ac</italic></highlight>, thus providing a more positive engagement between the window member <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> The invention is by no means limited to the foregoing examples and engaging pawls of other structures may of course be adopted.

<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Consider, for example, the engaging members <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that are provided two each on the right and left sides of the window member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the foregoing examples. This is not the sole case of the invention and as long as they are provided at least one each on the right and left sides of the window member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, their number can appropriately be determined depending upon various factors including the size of the magnetic tape cassette and the size of the window. This is also the case for the width and depth of the stepped portions <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provided on the window member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the stepped portions <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provided on the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Described above is the basic structural features of the first aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> We next describe the magnetic tape cassette according to the second embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Except for the structure of the transparent window in the upper half, the magnetic tape cassette according to the second embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention has essentially the same construction as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>; therefore, on the following pages, we describe only the structure of the transparent window in detail and omit the description of other parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows an example of the transparent window in the cassette case according to the second embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention and it is a section taken through the transparent window in the upper half in a longitudinal direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a section of the same transparent window which is taken in a transverse direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. As is clear from these figures, the transparent window in the upper half consists of an opening <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed as a window in the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and a window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> that is formed of a transparent resin and which is fitted in the opening <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to close it. </paragraph>

More specifically, the left end of the opening <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is of such a cross-sectional shape that it has a recess <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>made in the upper surface, with a surface <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>below the recess <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>inclining downward to the left, so that a V-shaped projection <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is defined by the bottom of the recess <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the inclined surface <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;V-shaped&rdquo; as used herein refers to a state where two planes are opposed at an angle, at least one of which is parallel to the upper and lower surfaces of the upper half&apos;s body whereas the other plane forms a specified angle with the one plane.

<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Once the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> has been fitted to the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the V-shaped projection <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>on the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> comes into intimate contact with the V-shaped recess <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the V-shaped projection <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>on the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> comes into intimate contact with the V-shaped recess <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>in the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> which shows both ends of the transparent window sectioned in the longitudinal direction) and, in addition, the flange <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>of the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is brought into intimate contact with the recess <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>in the upper surface of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> around the opening <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> which shows a cross-sectional shape of the transparent window as it is cut in a transverse direction perpendicular to the length). The resulting upper half is not only adequately air-tight, it also has sufficient strength against external forces (applied from above in the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> In order to separate the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> from the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> when the magnetic tape cassette is discarded after use, one may push the right end of the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> by applying a strong force from the inside (from below as indicated by the arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>) in a direction facing upward to the left, whereupon the flange <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>of the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> comes out of engagement with the V-shaped projection <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>on the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, permitting the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to be separated from the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> without breaking. If desired, a mark easily recognizable by the user or scrapper, as exemplified by PUSH, or an arrow designating the direction of depressing the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may be set off in the appropriate position and this helps provide a more positive way to designate the method of separating the two components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows a second example of the second embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention, in which the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> has the flange <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) and the V-shaped recess <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>) provided alternately in an intermittent manner. This design eliminates the possibility for undercuts to form in the mold for shaping the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the mold design is rendered simple enough to permit more economical fabrication of the window member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Needless to say, if the design shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is adopted, the recesses <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>in the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> around the opening <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as well as the V-shaped projections <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>on the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> around the opening <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>desirably have shapes corresponding to the flange <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) and the V-shaped recess <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>) in order to permit the fabrication of seemingly more excellent magnetic tape cassettes (having better external appearance). It should be noted here that the V-shape suffices to be provided in at least one position and it need not be provided across the entire width of the window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Described above is how the transparent window of the magnetic cassette case according to the second example of the second embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention is constructed. Unlike the prior art window which is fabricated by merely fitting the window member into the opening in the upper half&apos;s body and later welding them together, the areas in which the window member is joined to the upper half&apos;s body around the opening in it are formed to have an inclined V-shape in cross section, so the two components can be assembled without welding and the window member once fitted into the upper half&apos;s body is substantially immobile. The resulting upper half is not only adequately air-tight, it also has sufficient strength against external forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In order to separate the window member from the upper half&apos;s body when the magnetic tape cassette is discarded after use, one may push the window member from the inside (from below) upward at an angle, whereupon it can be separated from the opening in the upper half&apos;s body without breaking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Described above are the basic features of the magnetic tape cassette according to the second embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> We now describe a shaped resin article according to the sixth aspect of the invention with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> On the pages that follow, the shaped resin article according to the sixth aspect of the invention is described in detail by reference to a typical example, i.e., a magnetic tape cassette with a transparent residual tape check window that is integrated as an easily separable component. Needless to say, this is not the sole example of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows an example of the magnetic tape cassette according to the sixth aspect of the invention.

A slider <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> is fitted on the lower surface of the lower half <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and a lid <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is provided at the front face of the cassette (closer to the viewer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>). Again, those parts of the magnetic tape cassette which are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> are identical to the corresponding parts of the magnetic tape cassette shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and, hence, will not be described below in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The housing of the magnetic tape cassette <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> contains a length of magnetic tape wound around a pair of take-up hubs. The user of the magnetic tape cassette <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may occasionally find it necessary to check the residual amount of tape after unloading it from the deck (not shown). To this end, a transparent window member <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> (hereunder referred to simply as a window <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>) is provided in a window receiving portion (a window member receiving area) <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> of the upper half <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> in such a way that it can be easily separated for recovery. </paragraph>

If this design is adopted, the window receiving portion <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> should naturally have a shape corresponding to the shape of the window <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. To install the window <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> of the above-described shape, it is slid into the window receiving portion <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> of the upper half <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> by first pushing its shorter side in the direction indicated by the arrow A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> The shape of the window <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is by no means limited to the combination of two different sized rectangles. The only requirement is that the side of the window which is first pushed into the window receiving portion <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> of the upper half <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> (in the direction of the arrow A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>) should be longer than the opposite side (which is indicated by the arrow B) and the window <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> may be trapezoidal in shape as long as this requirement is met. In other words, the window <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> may of any shape as long as the window, being slid into the window receiving portion <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight>, does not pass through but stops in a predetermined position. Therefore, if the lugs <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and the recesses (<highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, . . . ) are designed to provide an engagement of reasonable strength, the shape of the window <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be a simple rectangle. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> In order to install the separable transparent window of the magnetic tape cassette according to the first embodiment of the second aspect of the invention, the following method may be employed. The first step of the process of fitting the transparent window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> in the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> involves inserting the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> into the groove <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> so that the two are joined temporarily. Since the ridges <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> are provided in the positions where they contact the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the inserted window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> causes the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>to deform elastically so that it is retained to the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> as the two members are joined temporarily (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> In the second step, the temporary joint where the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>has underwent elastic deformation to retain the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is subjected to ultrasonic or thermal welding. However, if the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> are made of materials that have no compatibility or have only small compatibility with each other, as in the case where the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is made of an ABS resin and the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> a transparent PS resin, ultrasonic or thermal welding does not cause fusion to occur between the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (particularly the ridges <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>); instead, the joining surfaces of the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (particularly the ridges <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) will only be depressed to deform as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Briefly, by means of ultrasonic or thermal welding, the elastic deformation of the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is eliminated but the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> will not be fused to the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the two members contact each other leaving no clearances therebetween so that they are incapable of relative movements (the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is fixed in position by being held between the upper and lower window frames <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). The thus formed transparent window of the tape magnetic tape cassette is just the same as the transparent window of the prior art and hence can be used without any difficulties. Note that the ridges <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be provided on the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> rather than on the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> The thus fabricated cassette case is then put to service and discarded. In this case, the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> may be separated from the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in the following manner so that the two parts can be recycled as feeds for additional production. Since the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is not fused to the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the user may push it hard from above, whereupon the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> deforms and the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> can be easily recovered. Even if the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>deforms only insufficiently and the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> breaks while it is pushed out of engagement with the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the broken window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> can be easily recovered from the groove <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> since the two members are not fused together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> Since the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are not fused to each other, no part of the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> will remain adhering to the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> or vice versa; the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> can be completely separated from the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the two parts can be recycled without suffering a drop in the purity as feeds for additional production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Another benefit is obtained in the operation of separating the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> from the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Since the two components are not fused together, the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> can be easily separated from the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the cassette case. Should the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> break, it can be easily recovered from the groove <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and this contributes safety to the separating operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a magnetic tape cassette according to another embodiment of the second aspect of the invention as it is sectioned through the transparent window in the upper half. The difference from the first embodiment is that the upper window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which is formed around the opening <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>which is thin enough to deform elastically, both being provided to hold and fix the window member in position, do not form continuous shapes but are rather formed in a plurality of discrete areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> The magnetic tape cassette according to the second embodiment brings about essentially the same advantage as the tape cassette according to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The second aspect of the invention also relates to the process for producing the magnetic tape cassettes according to the two embodiments described above. The process involves the following steps: first, the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> serving as the base are molded; the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is molded from a material that has no compatibility or has an extremely low degree of compatibility with the material of which the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is made whereas the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is molded in such a way that at least part of the area around the opening <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has the adequately rigid upper window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the elastically deformable lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and the groove <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed between the two window frames to provide a temporary fitting area into which the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> can be inserted; the upper frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> are also molded in such a way that the upper window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>or the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> has ribs in positions where either window frame contacts the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (in the illustrated case, the ribs <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed on the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>); in the second step, the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is inserted into the groove <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, whereupon the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>deforms elastically to establish temporary joint with the ribs <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>; thereafter, ultrasonic wave or heat is applied to the temporary joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> As a result, the ribs <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>joining temporarily to the lower window frame <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>collapse under the ultrasonic or thermal action so that the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is securely fastened in the groove <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the upper and lower window frames <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>formed in the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> around the opening <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Needless to say, the window member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> can be completely separated from the upper half <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in a simple and safe manner, with no part of it adhering to the latter. Thus, the process for producing the magnetic tape cassette according to the second aspect of the invention is quite effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> Described above are the basic features of the second aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> We next describe a magnetic tape cassette according to the third aspect of the invention and the process for its fabrication with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Again, the magnetic tape cassette according to the third aspect of the invention has basically the same structure as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, except for the structure of the transparent window in the upper half and the mechanism for installing it. Therefore, on the following pages, only the structure and installing mechanism will be described in detail and the other parts will not be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing the upper half of a magnetic tape cassette according to an embodiment of the third aspect of the invention as it is sectioned in a longitudinal direction; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> is a partial enlarged section of the upper half shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>. As is clear from these figures, the transparent window in the upper half generally indicated by <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> consists of an opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the upper half <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and a window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> that is made of a transparent resin and fitted in the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>, the body of the upper half <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> has the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and recesses <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed in the inner surfaces on both sides of the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The two recesses are interconnected by an edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>, the edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>formed as the bridge between the two recesses has a cross-sectional shape resembling a square block; however, as will be described later, the square is not the sole example that can be adopted in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>may be provided on the perimeter of the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>either throughout (continuously) or in selected areas (intermittently). For the reasons that will be set forth below, the edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> is desirably provided on the entire perimeter of the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> We next describe the method of forming the transparent window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45A and 45B</cross-reference> illustrate the process for making the transparent window according to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>. A die assembly for molding the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> having the transparent window has an upper die <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and a lower die <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> that define the general shape of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The upper die <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and the lower die <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> are of well-known types that can be used to mold a predetermined shape. Since the two dies are identical to those of the prior art, they need not be described herein and instead only portions that are relevant to the process for making the transparent window will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> The die assembly consisting of the upper die <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and the lower die <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> has two cores (or cavities) in the area where the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is made to receive the transparent window being fitted in; the first core <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> is provided in the upper die <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> to form the recess <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the front surface and the second core <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> is provided in the lower die <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> to form the recess <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the back surface and the edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>bridging the two recesses.

<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference> shows a transparent window according to another embodiment of the third aspect of the invention and this window can be molded in entirely the same manner as in the first embodiment by injecting a transparent resin into a cavity <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. Hence, there is no need to give a detailed description of this second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> The third aspect of the invention also relates to the process for producing the magnetic tape cassettes according to the above embodiments. The process involves the following steps: the first step is providing the die assembly for molding the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> which comprises the upper die <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and the lower die <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, as well as the first core <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and the second core <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> for making the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the first core <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> being capable of sliding into the die cavity from the front surface of the upper half&apos;s body and the second core <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> being capable of sliding into the die cavity from the back surface of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and having on opposite ends two recesses <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that are used to provide ridges <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>for establishing engagement between the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>; in the second step, the first core <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and the second core <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> in the die assembly are brought into intimate contact with each other; then, an upper half&apos;s body forming resin material is injected to mold the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> with the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in it; thereafter, the first core <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and the second core <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> are spaced apart and a transparent window member forming resin material that has no compatibility or has an extremely low degree of compatibility with the upper half&apos;s body forming resin material is injected into the resulting space (cavity) to mold the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> as an integral part of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. This process for producing the magnetic tape cassette according to the third aspect of the invention is quite effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> When the magnetic tape cassette employing the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> described above is discarded after use, one may find it necessary to disassemble the cassette case for recycling purposes. In this case, one may simply detach the upper half <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and press the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> by applying a strong force to its underside. The upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> are not fused to each other in the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>, so if the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> is depressed with great force from below, the edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>around the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will undergo plastic deformation or the edge of the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may break and come off; in either case, the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> can be easily separated from the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> In particular, if the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> are positioned in such a way that the lower end of the edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is in close proximity with the upper end of the annular portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and if both ends are sharp pointed, an applied stress will sufficiently concentrate that the annular portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> will simply break and come off with a comparatively small force. In this case, the edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is desirably provided on the entire perimeter of the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so that the annular portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will break and come off along the entire perimeter of the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> The window member according to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference> is so designed that the edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> around the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can deform more easily when the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> is depressed from below with strong force. In the embodiment under consideration, the edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>has such a cross-sectional shape that it projects as a triangular block with a plane inclined into the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. If the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> is depressed from below, the inclined plane deforms elastically; if it is depressed with a greater force, the inclined plane starts to undergo plastic deformation and the annular portion <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> will come off, whereupon the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> can be easily separated from the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Hence, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>, the edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is desirably provided in interrupted positions on the perimeter of the opening <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> The transparent window in the magnetic tape cassette according to the two embodiments of the third aspect of the invention are fabricated as described above. Since the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> serving as the base and the window member <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> are molded monolithically of two resins that have no compatibility with each other (or those which have little compatibility), the upper half is sufficiently air-tight to ensure satisfactory dust prevention. In addition, it is only external pressure and impact that are exerted on the tape cassette during manual handling as in the case of carrying, storage and loading on the record/reproduce apparatus; therefore, the tape cassette according to the third aspect of the invention has no strength problems at all if the edge portion <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is designed to have sufficient strength to withstand internal impact without breaking or coming off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> Described above are the basic features of the third aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> We now describe the method for multi-color molding of resin products according to the fourth aspect of the invention, as well as the magnetic tape cassette which is the resin product molded by the method with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> In the following description, a magnetic tape cassette is assumed as a typical example and particular reference is made to the method for molding an upper half which constitutes the housing of the magnetic tape cassette and a transparent window provided in the upper half as an aid for checking the residual amount of magnetic tape. It should, however, be noted that these are not the sole examples of the invention. Again, the magnetic tape cassette as the typical example has basically the same structure as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, except for the structure of the transparent window in the upper half and the mechanism for installing it. Therefore, on the following pages, only the structure and installing mechanism will be described in detail and the other parts will not be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference> is a plan view showing the upper half of the magnetic tape cassette according to the example under consideration and the transparent window provided in this upper half as an aid for checking the residual amount of magnetic tape. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>, the upper half indicated by <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is provided with the transparent window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> (hereunder referred to simply as the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>) as an aid for checking the residual amount of magnetic tape within the housing.

<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> The fitting combination of the upper half <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is shown more clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> which is a partial enlarged perspective view of the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> as it is fitted in the upper half <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>.

The first step in the molding process is for molding the upper half <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> by injecting a molten resin into a space (cavity) <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> defined by the upper die <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, the lower die <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> and the movable core <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> In the next step, the movable core <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> is lowered down by a distance equal to the thickness of the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and into the resulting space <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, a resin that is neither compatible with nor adherent to the resin of which the upper half was molded is injected to mold the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> By two-color molding with the same die assembly <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, the upper half <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> can be molded at substantially the same timing (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>). Since the upper half <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> are molded of incompatible materials, the former can be easily separated from the window (by lifting it up in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> The window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is then turned upside down and replaced in the upper half <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>.

The end portions of the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> ride over the bottom <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, a small extension of the upper half <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, so that the gaps around the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> (where the lugs <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, . . . are not provided) are closed to provide enhanced dust prevention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> The magnetic tape cassette according to the embodiment discussed above can be produced by applying the process for producing resin products according to the fourth aspect of the invention. First, resin parts including the upper half (its body) <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the window (its member) <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> are molded in multiple colors by means of the single die assembly <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> using at least two incompatible, non-adherent materials. After demolding the upper half <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is turned upside down and replaced in the upper half <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the embodiment under consideration, the upper half and the window are molded in two colors by means of the same die assembly using incompatible materials, or those non-adherent materials which have distant values for compatibilization parameter; after the molding, the window is separated from the upper half, turned upside down and replaced in the upper half. This provides ease not only in installing the window in the upper half but also separating the two parts as required for recycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52 and 54</cross-reference>, the fitting of the lugs <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> into the recesses <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, for example, the fitting of the lug <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>into the recess <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is so shown that a gap exists between the top of the lug <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the inner surfaces of the recess <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This is an exaggeration intended to clarify the state of coupling between the lug <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the recess <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In practice, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference> (sectional view) or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> (perspective view), there are substantially no gaps between the set of lugs <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, . . . on the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and the set of recesses <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, . . . in the upper half <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the former fit so snugly into the latter that there is no possibility for the window <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> to rattle when the magnetic tape cassette is in service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> Described above is not the only method for coupling the window to the upper half and the shapes of these parts also are not limited to the examples described above. Other suitable methods can of course be employed to bring the window into engagement with the upper half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the embodiment described above, the window and the upper half are molded of incompatible materials (in two colors or layers) by the core backing process; after the molding, the window is separated from the upper half, turned upside down and replaced in the upper half so that the former is brought into engagement with the latter by means of fitting between the lugs and recesses formed in the shaped article or some other suitable engaging means; as a result, the window, the upper half and various other parts of the magnetic tape cassette can easily be recovered as separate entities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> Described above are the basic features of the fourth aspect of the invention. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 58A and 58B</cross-reference>, the window member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> has on one lateral side (the left side) a retaining pawl <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which is so formed as to hold the edge portion <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> in cooperation with the edge portion <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>; by means of the retaining pawl <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the edge portion <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is held in intimate contact with the edge portion <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> In the center of the other side (the right side) of the window member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, there is provided an engaging member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> which secures the window member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> to the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. The engaging member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is positioned within the cutout <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>in the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> such that an engaging pawl <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the distal end is brought into engagement with the underside of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> to fix the window member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> in position. The engaging member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> also has a thin-walled, elastic spring portion <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which urges it to be positively brought into engagement with the underside of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>A, both the retaining pawl <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the window member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and the engaging pawl <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the engaging member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> project down below the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. If this is not desirable for certain reasons such as the layout of magnetic tape within the cassette case, both the retaining pawl <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the engaging pawl <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be confined within the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58B</cross-reference>. In this alternative case, the recess through which the engaging pawl <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is passed to establish engagement with the underside of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> may itself be used as a disengagement groove <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>by means of which the engaging pawl <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be disengaged from the underside of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> When the magnetic tape cassette according to the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57 and 58</cross-reference> is in service, the edge portion <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> on the perimeter of the opening <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>remains in intimate contact with the edge portion <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the window member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and the window member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> has no problems at all with respect to air-tightness and strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> If the magnetic tape cassette, whether it is of the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58A</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>B, is discarded after use, a tool may be inserted into the manipulating engaging portion <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>from above the cassette case <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and the engaging pawl <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the engaging member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is dislodged from the corresponding cutout of the opening <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>; as a result, the window member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> can be easily separated from the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> without letting any foreign material stick to or mingle with either part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> The seventh aspect of the invention is by no means limited to the foregoing examples and it is possible to use engaging pawls of other structures. Of course, the concept of this aspect can equally be applied to various types of transparent window that are provided in other models of magnetic tape cassette as an aid for visual check of the interior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> For instance, the foregoing examples are directed to the case where the window member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is brought into mechanical engagement with the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>; however, this is not the sole case of the invention and it can be implemented with other cases of engagement between the window member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and the upper half&apos;s body <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> such as where it is accomplished by thermal welding or through thermal fusion of two compatible resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> Described above are the basic features of the seventh aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> We now describe a magnetic tape cassette according to the eighth aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> As already mentioned, the choice for resins that constitute individual parts (members) of the magnetic tape cassette has heretofore depended primarily on mechanical strength (including creep resistance), physical properties such as dimensional stability and heat resistance, and chemical properties such as corrosion resistance. In recent years, another important factor has been added to the list&mdash;the ease with which resins can be decomposed with naturally occurring microorganisms (called biodegradability, this factor is important when the magnetic tape cassette is disposed of by discarding). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> The magnetic tape cassette (hereunder referred to simply as &ldquo;cassette&rdquo;) according to the eighth aspect of the invention is characterized by constituting various parts (members) of the cassette with resins having good &ldquo;biodegradability&rdquo;. In the following description of the eighth aspect of the invention, the term &ldquo;upper&rdquo; shall mean the side where the upper half is positioned and the term &ldquo;lower&rdquo; shall mean the side where the lower half is positioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> The concept of the eighth aspect of the invention is applied to a magnetic tape cassette comprising magnetic tape and a housing in which the magnetic tape is placed rotatably; it is applicable to all models of the two-reel type magnetic tape cassettes in which a pair of tape reels having the magnetic tape wound around a pair of reel hubs are placed in specified positions such that the magnetic tape can be drawn out of the housing or that it is capable of running; alternatively, it can be applied to all models of the one-reel type magnetic tape cassettes in which a single tape reel having the magnetic tape wound around a single reel hub is placed in a specified position such that the magnetic tape can be drawn out of the housing or that it is capable of running. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> In the cassette according to the eighth aspect of the invention, the housing (cassette case) is a member that is principally composed of the upper half and the lower half and which additionally includes other parts to be installed in the upper or lower half, as well as the tape reel or reels around which the magnetic tape is wound and those parts which are used to hold or accommodate the part of the magnetic tape which has been unwound from the tape reel or reels. Other parts to be installed in the upper or lower half include the lid (front cover) and the slider which is slidably fitted on the underside of the lower half; these and other necessary components are combined with the upper and lower halves to make up the housing (cassette case). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> A cassette according to an example of the eighth aspect of the invention is such that the window member to be fitted into at least one of the window openings in the upper half is made of a biodegradable resin. The biodegradable resin which forms the window member maintains comparable functions to the conventional resins during service but is thereafter decomposed by the action of naturally occurring microorganisms to be eventually converted to water and inorganic matter such as carbon dioxide; the biodegradability of such resins can be tested by the methods described in ISO 14851, ISO 14852 and ISO 14855. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> ISO 14851 and ISO 14852 specify the biodegradability in an aerobic aqueous system; the rate of decomposition is determined from the consumption of oxygen (in ISO 14851) or from the evolution of carbon dioxide (in ISO 14852) and those resins which are decomposed by at least 60% within a maximum period of 6 months are regarded as applicable biodegradable resins. In ISO 14855, the rate of decomposition is determined from the evolution of carbon dioxide under composting conditions and those resins which are decomposed by at least 70% within a maximum period of 6 months are regarded as applicable biodegradable resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> The biodegradable resins meeting those requirements can be classified as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> (1) Organism Produced Polymers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> (a) poly(&bgr;-hydroxybutyric acid) (e.g. BIOGREEN of MITSUBISHI GAS CHEMICAL CO., INC.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> (b) poly(hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate) (e.g. BIOPOL of Japan Monsanto in an amount of up to about 30% as an additive (filler)) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> (2) Synthetic Polymers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> (a) poly(lactic acid) (LACTY of Shimadzu Corp., RAYCIA of Mitsui Chemicals, Inc., and ECOPLAY of Cargill-Dow) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> (b) polycaprolactone (PCL) (CELL GREEN P-H of DAICEL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD. in an amount of up to about 30% as an additive (filler)) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> (3) Naturally Occurring Polymers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> (a) cellulose acetate (e.g. CELL GREEN P-CA of DAICEL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> (b) starch&plus;PCL (e.g. MATERBY of Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. and NOBON of Chisso Corporation) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> (c) modified starch (e.g. EVER CORN of Nippon Corn Starch Co., Ltd.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> Note that all polymers listed above can be used as additives (fillers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> In the eighth aspect of the invention, accelerators for microbial degradation may also be used. Exemplary accelerators for microbial degradation include master batches prepared by blending high concentrations of various starches including corn starch, potato starch, rice starch and their modified starches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> Biodegradable resins used to form the window member are preferably based on poly(lactic acid), more preferably in combination with poly(hydroxybutyrene) (PHB), polycaprolactone (PCL) or poly(butyrene succinate) (PBS). Particularly preferred is the combination of poly(lactic acid) with 1-60%, most preferably 20-30%, of poly(hydroxybutyrene) (PHB), polycaprolactone (PCL) or poly(butyrene succinate) (PBS) since this provides good melt flow characteristics during molding and the obtained window member is high in impact resistance, clarity and resistance to hydrolysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> In the example under consideration, the window member can be produced by injection molding of one or more of the biodegradable resins listed above or a batch consisting of such biodegradable resins as a major ingredient and other necessary ingredients. The shape, size and other parameters of the window member may be chosen as appropriate for the magnetic tape cassette into which it is to be fitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> The window member can be fitted into the window opening by various methods which include but are not limited to welding, mechanical fitting and snap fitting. If fitting is effected by welding, the use of the biodegradable resins has the advantage that the window member undergoing thermal recycling emits less heat which is no more than half the amount generated from all-purpose resins such as ABS resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> Described above are the basic features of the eighth aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> We now describe a method for destructing and separating components made of dissimilar materials according to the ninth aspect of the invention with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> In the following description of the method for destructing and separating components made of dissimilar materials according to the ninth aspect of the invention, a magnetic tape cassette is taken as a typical example of a resin product made of dissimilar materials and detailed description is given below for the method which is intended to ensure that a transparent window provided in the cassette case (housing) in order to help check the residual amount of magnetic tape can be readily taken apart from the housing for recycling. Needless to say, this is not the sole case of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference> shows a magnetic tape cassette according to an example of the ninth aspect of the invention. As shown, the magnetic tape cassette generally indicated by <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> consists of an upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> and a lower half <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> that combine to form the housing (cassette case). A slider <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight> is fitted to the underside of the lower half <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> and a lid <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> is provided at the front face of the cassette (which is closer to the viewer). The slider <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight> can slide back and forth on the underside of the lower half <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> so that when the cassette is not in service, the slider prevents dust from getting into the cassette by closing the opening in the lower part of the cassette case. The lid <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> on the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted on a shaft <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so that it can open or close the front face of the cassette. Again, those parts of the magnetic tape cassette which are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference> are identical to the corresponding parts of the magnetic tape cassette shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and need not be described in detail in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> The housing of the magnetic tape cassette <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> contains magnetic tape (not shown) as it is wound around a pair of take-up hubs. The upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> has a transparent window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> through which the residual amount of tape in the magnetic tape cassette <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> can be checked as when it has been taken out of the deck (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> The example under consideration is characterized in that the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> can be easily separated for recovery from the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> which is a component of the housing of the magnetic tape cassette. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> To this end, the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> in the magnetic tape cassette <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> is so adapted as to permit easy breaking and separating. Conventionally, the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> is molded by injecting a molten resin through a gate provided at the center of the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight>. This is not the case of the example under consideration and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59, a</cross-reference> gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> is provided at one end of the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction. A destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> is provided at the other end of the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> which is diametrically opposite the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction. The destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> indicates that if a force is applied to the position of that mark, the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> can be easily split and separated from the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> It is generally known that injection molded articles are prone to break in the direction of flow of a molten resin. Given the same wall thickness, the molten resin tends to flow uniformly in a radial direction from the gate. In the case of injection molding the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> in the magnetic tape cassette shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference>, the molten resin coming out of the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> spreads radially outward to yield a molding as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference>. If a force is applied to a certain point P, a crack <highlight><bold>469</bold></highlight> develops and progresses toward the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> in a direction perpendicular to the lines along which the resin spread radially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> This property of injection molded articles is effectively used in the example under consideration and the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> is provided on the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> in a position diametrically opposite the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59 and 61</cross-reference>. Stated specifically, the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> is at the mid-point of one of the two shorter sides of the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> (to be exact, at a point slightly inward of the mid-point) and the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> which is diametrically opposite the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> is correspondingly at the mid-point of the other shorter side of the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> (to be exact, at a point slightly inward of the mid-point). By applying a force to the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>, one can split it into two neat shapes along the line extending straight toward the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> The manner of providing the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> is not limited to any particular way. A special die assembly may be used to provide a triangular or other marks as the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> is injection molded. A stamp may later be impressed on the molded window. If desired, a specified mark or letters stating in effect PRESS TO SPLIT may be printed, or a seal stating to that effect may be attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> The window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> may be molded simultaneously with the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> in two colors using the same die assembly; alternatively, the two parts may be molded as separate entities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> If desired, the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> may be so designed that its shorter sides (ends) <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which cross the straight line connecting the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> and the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> are not fixed to the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> whereas its longer sides <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>which do not cross the straight line are fixed to the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight>; this design allows the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> to break into two neat shapes along the center line in the longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> The longer sides <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> need not altogether be secured to the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> but, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62, a</cross-reference> plurality of lugs <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> may be formed on each of those sides to provide exclusive areas where the window is bonded to the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight>. The advantage of this design is that once the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> is broken into two parts in the longitudinal direction, each part can be easily separated from the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> since it is only fixed to the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> in selected areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> breaks under a very small force that is applied to the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>, the strength of the product cannot be assured during normal use. Hence, cracking should not develop unless the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> is given a sufficient force to break the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight>. However, it is not desirable that the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> do not break until after considerable force is applied to the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>. To meet these requirements, the design illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference> may be adopted, in which a small cutout <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> is made on the side <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>where the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> is provided as shown; if a force is exerted at the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> in a direction toward the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight>, cracking develops and will progress smoothly from the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> toward the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> Thus, a force is applied to the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> in a direction parallel to the direction in which the cutout <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> is made; even if the applied force is not great enough, cracking will progress from the cutout <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> toward the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> and the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> can break easily. To provide an area for the cutout <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>, the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> is preferably of such a length that the side <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>slightly overlaps the upper half <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> and the cutout <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> may be provided in the overlap. This design eliminates the possibility for dirt to get into the magnetic tape cassette via the cutout <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> An alternative design is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</cross-reference>, in which the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> is provided with a straight groove <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> along its length to connect the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> and the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>. If the groove <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> is too deep, the window <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> may potentially break under a small impact during normal use. In addition, the groove <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> needs only to help cracking progress toward the gate <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> after a force was applied to the destruction mark <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> in order to break the window <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>. Hence, the groove <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> need not be deeper than necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> Depending on the type of magnetic tape cassette, ribs for regulating the positions of magnetic tape take-up hubs are provided inside the window. In this case, a crack that develops at the destruction mark upon application of a force and which propagates toward the gate may stop at the ribs or divert laterally and the window sometimes fails to split neat in the longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> Even in these cases, the groove <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</cross-reference> serve as a guideline along which cracking propagates smoothly enough to ensure that the window breaks neat in the longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the ribs may be provided with a cutout in those areas which intersect with the propagation of cracking from the destruction mark toward the gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> As already mentioned, in the usual case of injection molding the window, the gate is located at the center of the window. Even in this case, the destruction mark may be provided near the center of one of the two shorter sides of the window in the longitudinal direction as in the foregoing example and if the destruction mark is depressed, a crack develops and propagates toward the central gate. If the window is split in a favorable manner, the crack will go beyond the central gate to progress unimpeded toward the opposite shorter side. Thus, the method of providing the destruction mark according to the example under consideration is effective even in the conventional process of injection molding the window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> While the window has been assumed to have a rectangular shape in the foregoing example, various other shapes may also be adopted. Even in the case of nonrectangular windows, the destruction mark may be provided in such positions that upon application of an impact to the mark, cracking develops at the affected point and propagates toward the gate. For example, the destruction mark may be provided on the window in the position which is the farthest from the gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> Considering the relative positions of the gate and the destruction mark, it is generally recommended that the gate and the destruction mark be provided in such positions that they are connected by the longest straight line that can be drawn to traverses the window. In this case, the window can be split into two halves of generally the same size and it is easy to separate them later for recovery from the upper half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> On the foregoing pages, an example of the ninth aspect of the invention has been described in detail and according to this example, the transparent window provided in the upper half of a magnetic tape cassette to help check the residual amount of magnetic tape can be easily broken so that it is separated from the upper half in a smooth, positive and safest way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the concept of the ninth aspect of the invention is not only applicable to the transparent window of a magnetic tape cassette, it is also applicable to other shaped resin articles in general. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> Described above are the basic features of the ninth aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> While a magnetic tape cassette, a process for producing it, a resin shaped article, a method for multicolor molding of resin products and a method for destructing and separating parts made of dissimilar materials have been described on the foregoing pages in detail with reference to various examples to the extent that they are within the scope of the present invention, it should be noted that the examples are intended for illustrative purposes only and are by no means taken to limit the invention. Obviously, the concept of the invention allows for easy modification of details of various design considerations and it is equally applicable to other models of magnetic tape cassette. It goes without saying that various improvements and modifications are possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> For example, the separable transparent window having the structure described above is not only used to check the residual amount of tape in the magnetic tape cassette; obviously, the same structure is equally applicable to the purpose of installing a variety of transparent windows intended for visually checking the interior of the tape cassette, particularly those provided in other models of magnetic tape cassette. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> In addition, the various methods described in the foregoing examples for coupling parts of dissimilar resins (plastics) are applicable to a wide variety of resin (plastic) products other than the magnetic tape cassette. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, the magnetic tape cassette according to the first aspect of the invention is characterized in that the transparent window consisting of a window member and a base (an upper half&apos;s body) that are not welded together can be easily disassembled and that the two components can be completely separated without letting part of the window member stick to the base or vice versa, with the advantage that they can be recycled as feeds for additional products without suffering a drop in purity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, the second aspect of the invention brings about the same advantages as the first aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> In addition, the window member can be separated from the base in an easy and safest manner, thus contributing utmost safety to the operating personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, according to the third aspect of the invention, the opening in the upper half&apos;s body serving as the base of the upper half has such a cross-sectional shape that it has a recess in both an upper and a lower surface and an edge portion that bridges the two recesses and the window member is directly molded in the opening, thereby providing the same advantages as in the first aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> In addition, the die assembly for molding the window member has a first and a second retractable core, so both the upper half and the window member can be molded with the same die assembly by changing only the positions of the two cores; as a result, the die assembly can be prepared at low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, according to the fourth aspect of the invention, two or more incompatible resin materials that are not adherent to each other are used in a core backing, multi-color molding method to mold parts of the resin materials in multiple colors at substantially the same timing using a single die assembly; then, the respective parts are demolded and recombined together, whereby all parts are installed in one step to make a resin product. The thus assembled parts can be easily separated and recovered for recycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, the first embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention can bring about the same advantages as the first aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0407&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, the magnetic cassette case according to the second embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention is characterized in that the areas in which the window member is joined to the base (the upper half&apos;s body) around the opening in it are formed to have a cross section which is asymmetric with respect to the center line and which has an inclined plane; hence, the base and the window member which are the two components of the window are not welded together and the window member once fitted into the base is substantially immobile. The resulting upper half is not only adequately air-tight, it also has sufficient strength against external forces. In the second embodiment under consideration, the window member can be easily separated from the opening in the base by pushing it at an angle; this is the same advantage as obtained in the first aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, according to the third embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention, a circular opening is made in the base of the upper half and a correspondingly circular window member is threaded into the opening; this design contributes to providing the same advantage as in the first aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> If the window member has a flange, it can be firmly secured to provide an upper half which is not only airtight but also strong enough to resist external pressure and impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0410&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, the sixth aspect of the invention realizes a shaped resin article that is formed of parts of dissimilar materials and which permits the respective parts to be easily separated and recovered for recycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0411&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, the seventh aspect of the invention can bring about the same advantages as the first aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0412" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0412&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, according to the eighth aspect of the invention, a smaller amount of heat is emitted in the recycling processes, contributing to preservation of the earth&apos;s environment and prevention of global warming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, according to the ninth aspect of the invention, a shaped resin article made of parts of dissimilar materials can be destructed in a simple, positive and safest way so that they are efficiently separated for recovery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the various aspects of the invention, there are provided magnetic tape cassettes of structures that permit utmost safety in the operation of separating the window member from the body of the upper half of the magnetic tape cassette that has been discarded after use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> According to the various aspects of the invention, there are also provided magnetic tape cassettes which will emit a smaller amount of heat even if part of the discarded tape cassette should be subjected to thermal recycling. Thus, according to the various aspects of the invention, one can provide magnetic tape cassettes that emit a smaller amount of heat in the recycling processes, contributing to preservation of the earth&apos;s environment and prevention of global warming. </paragraph>
