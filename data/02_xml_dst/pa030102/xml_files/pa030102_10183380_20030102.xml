<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a receiving terminal of a mobile communication system, and more particularly, to a triple band receiving terminal of a mobile communication system. The terminal can be used in three bands by adding a circuit to a dual band mobile communication terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, a popular mobile communication terminal needs to have, multi-function, diversification and compatibility improvement, the terminal also has to be compatible with equipments related to the Internet. The mobile communication terminal market has been rapidly expanded. In addition, interests in a dual band mobile communication terminal usable as a two-way system of a GSM (global system for mobile communication) and a DCS (digital cellular system) in Europe have increased. A triple band mobile communication terminal usable in a PCS (personal communication system) besides the GSM and the DCS and usable all over the world is even more in demand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The GSM is a TDMA (time division multiple access) digital system commonly used in European countries. The GSM supports non-synchronous and synchronous data communication, it can be linked with an ISDN, a packet switching network, the Internet, as well as a voice communication. The GSM is operated in a 900 MHz frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The DCS (digital cellular system) having a frequency range of 1800 MHz for a European PCN (personal mobile communication network) is a system upbanding the GSM. A CDMA (code division multi access) type PCS (personal communication system) uses a signal having 1900 MHz band and provides various kinds of radio communication services such as voice, data and fax, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram illustrating a dual band receiving apparatus of a mobile communication terminal of a related art. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the dual band receiving apparatus allows the mobile communication terminal operate in two bands, a 900 MHz EGSM (extended global system for mobile communication) and a 1800 MHz DCS (digital cellular system). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The dual band receiving apparatus includes a filter unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receiving a signal inputted through an antenna and passing a pertinent frequency, an amplifier unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> amplifying the signal passing through the filter unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a phase shift unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receiving an oscillation frequency outputted from a local oscillator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and phase-modulating the frequency, and a mixing unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> mixing the oscillation frequency outputted through the phase shift unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with the signal received through the amplifier unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and outputting an intermediate frequency signal. That is, the dual band receiving apparatus of the mobile communication terminal includes a filter, a low noise amplifier, a mixer and a phase shift in order to receive signals in different bands. In addition, the amplifier unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the mixing unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the phase shift unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the local oscillator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> construct a RF (radio frequency) receiver (R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) for dual band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, according to regional characteristics or user&apos;s preferences, a mobile communication terminal has to be used as a PCS (personal communication system) or a DCS (digital cellular system) or a GSM (global system for mobile communication). Because the mobile communication has to satisfy all three bands, a triple band receiving terminal is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a triple band receiving apparatus of a mobile communication terminal of a related art. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the triple band receiving apparatus allows the mobile communication terminal operate in multiple bands, a 900 MHz EGSM (extended global system for mobile communication), a 1800 MHz DCS (digital cellular system) and a 1900 MHz PCS (personal communication system). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The triple band receiving apparatus of the mobile communication terminal includes a first filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a second filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a third filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> passing only a reception frequency corresponding to each frequency band among signals received through an antenna. A third LNA (low noise amplifier) <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> amplifies a signal outputted from the third filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a fourth filter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> eliminates the image signal outputted from the third LNA <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a RF (radio frequency) receiver (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) mixes the signals passing the first <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the second <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the fourth filters <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the oscillation frequency and outputs an intermediate frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The RF receiver (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) includes a first <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a second LNA (low noise amplifier) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> amplifying signals passing the first <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second filters <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a first <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a second <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a third <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> phase shifters receiving the oscillation frequency outputted from the local oscillator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Then, the RF receiver (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) modulates the signals in quadrature, a first <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a second <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a third <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a fourth <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a fifth <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and a sixth <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> mixers mix the oscillation frequency outputted from the first <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the second <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the third phase <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> shifters with the signal outputted from the first <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second LNA <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the fourth filter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, then, outputs an intermediate signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The first filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> passes a 900 MHz band signal, the second filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> passes a 1800 MHz band signal, and the third filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> passes a 1900 MHz band signal. Further, the fourth filter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> eliminates an image signal existed in the signal outputted from the third LNA <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, then divides the image signal into positive and negative portions and subsequently inputs them to the fifth <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the sixth <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> mixers respectively in order to eliminate more noise elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In order to use the conventional dual band mobile communication terminal in three bands, the RF receiver has to be replaced into a triple band RF receiver. In this triple band RF receiver, each terminal corresponds to each frequency band, and a low noise amplifier and a filter for a PCS have to be additionally implemented, therefore, production process and production cost are increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the conventional triple band receiving apparatus for the mobile communication terminal, implementing a RF receiver includes each terminal for each frequency band. Because an internal circuit construction is complicated and its volume is increased, it runs contrary to the recent mobile communication system trend of miniaturization and light-weight. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram illustrating a preferred embodiment of a triple band receiving terminal of a mobile communication system in accordance with the present invention. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> triple band receiving terminal allows a mobile communication system operate in multiple bands, such as a 900 MHz EGSM (extended global system for mobile communication), a 1800 MHz DCS (digital cellular system) and a 1900 MHz PCS (personal communication system) through an antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The triple band receiving terminal of the mobile communication system includes a filter unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> passing respective reception frequencies corresponding to each frequency band among signals received through an antenna (not shown), an impedance matching unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> matching an impedance of signals outputted through the filter unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a switching unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> selectively outputting a signal passing the impedance matching unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and a RF (radio frequency) receiver R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> mixing the signal from the switching unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> with the signal from the filter unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and outputting an intermediate frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The filter unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a first filter <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> passing a 925&tilde;960 MHz EGSM signal, a second filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> passing a 1805&tilde;1880 MHz DCS signal and a third filter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> passing a 1930&tilde;1990 MHz PCS signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The impedance matching unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a first matching unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> receiving output of the second filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and outputting to the switching unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and a second matching unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> receiving output of the third filter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and outputting to the switching unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. However, the first matching unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the second matching unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> adjust an impedance mismatching before the input end of the RF receiver (R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), occurred according to an additional installation of the switching unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, as 50 ohm.

Preferably, the RF receiver (R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) has the same structure as the dual band RF receiver (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The local oscillator <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> outputs oscillation frequencies to two phase shifters respectively according to an EGSM signal, a DCS signal and a PCS signal received through the antenna (not shown). The first and the second phase shifters <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> are set as 90&deg;, however, an oscillation frequency received from the local oscillator <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is different according to a frequency of a signal inputted through the antenna (not shown). An oscillation frequency outputted from the first and the second phase shifts <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> is different according to an reception signal inputted to the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Further, the first <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and the second <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> mixers mix the signal outputted from the first low noise amplifier <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> with the oscillation frequency outputted from the first phase shifter <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, and the third <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> and the fourth <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> mixers mix the signal outputted from the second low noise amplifier <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> through the switching unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> with the oscillation frequency outputted from the second phase shifter <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Specifically, among reception frequencies, a 925&tilde;960 MHz EGSM signal is filtered in the first filter <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a 1805&tilde;1880 MHz DCS signal is filtered in the second filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a 1930&tilde;1990 MHz PCS signal is filtered in the third filter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The signal passing the first filter <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is amplified at a certain level by passing the first low noise amplifier <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> of the RF receiver (R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and is inputted to the first and the second mixers <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. In the meantime, the first phase shifter <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> receiving the oscillation frequency outputted from the local oscillator <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> outputs a quadrature-modulated signal to the first and the second mixers <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. The first and the second mixers <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> mix the signal outputted from the first low noise amplifier <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> with the oscillation frequency outputted from the first phase shifter <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and outputs an intermediate frequency signal. </paragraph>

Thereafter, the first and the second matching units <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> placed before the input end of the switching unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> adjust an impedance mismatching before the input end of the RF receiver (R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The DCS signal passing the second filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is impedance-matched in the first matching unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The DCS signal passes the switching unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and is inputted to the second low noise amplifier <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the RF receiver (R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), and is then amplified at a certain level, and finally is inputted to the first and the second mixers <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the second phase shifter <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> receiving the oscillation frequency outputted from the local oscillator <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> outputs respective modulated signals to the third and the fourth mixers <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. The third and the fourth mixers <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> mix the signal outputted form the second low noise amplifier <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> with the oscillation frequency outputted from the second phase shifter <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and outputs an intermediate frequency signal. </paragraph>
