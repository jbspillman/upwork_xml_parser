<heading lvl="1">TEXT OF DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a condenser for vehicle air-conditioning systems. More precisely, the invention relates to a condenser comprising a pair of parallel distributors between which is set a heat-exchange core including a plurality of pipes having a flat cross section, which are parallel to one another, and a plurality of undulated fins set between each pair of adjacent pipes. In condensers of this type, a reinforcing element is applied on at least one end side of the heat-exchange core. In known solutions, the heat-exchange core terminates, on each of its sides, with an undulated fin fixed to the respective end pipe, and the reinforcing element is fixed on said fin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The purpose of the present invention is to provide a condenser of an improved type which, given the same level of performance, is simpler and less costly than a condenser according to the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the above purpose is achieved by a condenser having the characteristics that form the subject of the main claim. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the solution according to the present invention, the reinforcing element is fixed directly on the end pipe of the heat-exchange core, without any undulated fin being set between a pipe and the reinforcing element. The present invention stems from the realization of the fact that the undulated fins set at the ends of the heat-exchange core practically do not have any effect in terms of heat-exchange performance of the condenser because, when the condenser is mounted on a vehicle, the said fins are often covered and are not impinged upon by the flow of air. Consequently, the end fins can be eliminated, and the reinforcing element can be set directly in contact with the outer surface of the end pipe, without there being any reduction in the performance of the heat exchanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The solution according to the present invention makes it possible to obtain a reduction in the weight and number of components, as well as a reduction in the cost of the raw materials and a reduction in assembly-cycle time. Preferably, the reinforcing element has an undulated shape and is provided with holes for fixing the brackets for anchorage of the condenser. In the case where it is not necessary to fix the anchoring brackets to the reinforcing elements, the solution according to the invention makes it possible to obtain, as compared to a condenser according to the prior art with equal characteristics, a reduction in the overall dimensions, or else an increase in the level of performance, thanks to the possibility of adding a pipe, given the same overall dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings, which are provided purely by way of non-limiting example and in which: </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> With reference to the figures, number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> designates a condenser for vehicle air-conditioning systems. The condenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of tubular distributors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between which is set a heat-exchange core <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprising a plurality of pipes having a flat cross section, the ends of which are fixed to the distributors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and are set in fluid communication with the latter. The heat-exchange core <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of heat-exchange fins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> formed by thin undulated aluminium strips, which are set between each pair of adjacent pipes. The assembly made up of the pipes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the undulated fins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the distributors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is obtained according to a technology in itself known, which envisages preliminary assembly by tacking of the various components and, in a subsequent step, fixing of the various components together by oven brazing. In a way in itself known, the pipes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and distributors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are provided, on their outer surfaces, with a layer of brazing alloy which, during passage through the oven, ensures fixing between the pipes and the fins and between the pipes and the distributors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The heat-exchange core <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has two end sides <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which are parallel to the pipes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and along which respective reinforcing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are applied. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, each reinforcing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> consists of a metal element obtained by pressing or rolling and preferably having an undulated shape. The reinforcing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have a thickness considerably greater than the thickness of the undulated fins <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Each protective element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fixed to the respective end tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>during the oven-brazing operation itself that produces fixing between the tubes, fins and distributors. The reinforcing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> basically extends throughout the length of the pipe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is fixed to the latter along the surfaces of mutual contact, designated by <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. Preferably, the reinforcing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is provided with holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> formed on plane portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> set at some distance from the outer surface of the pipe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be used for fixing anchoring brackets (not illustrated) for fastening the condenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the structure of the vehicle or of the radiator set behind the condenser. The anchoring brackets can be fixed to the reinforcing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by means of a simple riveting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has, as its main purpose, that of protecting the end tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from any impact that might perforate the tube. The undulated shape of the reinforcing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> makes it possible to increase the characteristics of stiffness thereof. In addition, the reinforcing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contributes, even though to a minimal extent, to the heat exchange with the flow of air which, during use, impinges upon the condenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
