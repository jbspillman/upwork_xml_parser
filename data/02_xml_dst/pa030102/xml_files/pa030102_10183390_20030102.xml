<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a measurement data processor for processing measurement data measured by a measuring instrument and measurement data processing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, measurement data measured by a measuring instrument is read by a computer system connected to the measuring instrument, where the measurement data is stored in a memory and arithmetically processed to be displayed as a graph. When the measurement data is processed at a place other than measurement site, an arrangement shown in, for instance, Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication No. 2001-41827 is used, where the measurement data is transmitted to a computer system located at the place other than the measurement site using a modem or a communications terminal through phone line or radio transmitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, according to the above conventional arrangement, the measurement data can be processed only by the computer system connected to the measuring instrument or other computer system connected to the computer system through phone line etc., so that handlability of the measurement data is restricted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a cellular phone or a PHS (Personal Handyphone System) etc. is widely used as a mobile communications terminal for transmitting and receiving a signal via base station by a predetermined operation on operation key. Such cellular phone and PHS can transit and receive signals such as document data, picture data and music data as well as functioning as an ordinary phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, it is required for the mobile communications terminal such as cellular phone and PHS to retain original telephone call function. Accordingly, the mobile communications terminal can only transmit and receive data with relatively small capacity and capable of easily standardization, such as document data, picture data and music data. The measurement data measured by the measuring inherent has data format inherent to each measuring instrument and currently cannot be transmitted and received as an ordinary signal capable of being used for a mobile phone and PHS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As described above, the conventional arrangement for transmitting and receiving measurement data is restricted to the computer system connected to the measuring instrument or other computer system connected to the computer system in a manner capable of transmitting and receiving signal, so that handlability of measurement data is difficult to be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, the mobile communications terminal such as cellular phone and PHS cannot transmit and receive measurement data having data format characteristic of each measuring instrument without impairing original function. </paragraph>

Further, an antenna <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided to the lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be extendable from the turning distal end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A circuit board (not shown) mounted with a controller is provided in the body case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An operating means (not shown) for outputting a predetermined electric current m response to operation of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected to the controller. The controller detects the electric current outputted by the operating means to send various control command and convert the electric current from the operating means into character data etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A vocalizer (not shown) including the microphone <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the speaker <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to the controller. The vocalizer is controlled by the controller and detects the electric signal outputted by the microphone <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as sound data and converts the sound data into an electric signal and outputs to the speaker <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to generate sound from the speaker <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A communicator (not shown) having the antenna <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is connected to the controller The communicator is controlled by the controller to transmit the converted signal representing sound data and character data and receives signal from the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A display means (not shown) including the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is connected to the controller. The display means is controlled by the controller to display the character data and picture data on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A memory is connected to the controller. The memory readably stores various data and control operations. Further, a control processing software for recognizing the measurement data inputted by the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the connector is memorized in the memory. The control processing software converts the measurement data into an electric signal, i.e. into the same format as the signal transmitted and received by the communicator to/from the base station. Incidentally, STINGER (tradename) of Microsoft Corporation is used as the control processing software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An operation processing software as a processor for arithmetically processing the data inputted via the connector is memorized in the memory connected to the controller. Incidentally, the control processing software and the operation processing software may not be stored in the memory, but may be stored in the data storage <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in advance and the software may be read and executed from the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by operating the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the communicator controlled by the controller. Alternatively, the software may be stored in a memory attachable and detachable with the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the memory may be connected to the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in executing the software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Next, an operation of the above-described embodiment will be described below with reference to attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Initially, the terminal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the connector of the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected, the controller recognizes connection of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and reads out to and start the control processing software for reading the measurement data from the memory. Incidentally, the control processing software may be started by the operation of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated to select the specific control, the controller conducts control process in accordance with the selected operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the controller determines whether &ldquo;1&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated or not (step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). When operation on the &ldquo;1&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is recognized, the process advances to a first processing (step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the operation of the &ldquo;1&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not judged, whether &ldquo;2&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated or not (step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is determined. When operation on the &ldquo;2&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is recognized, the process advances to a second processing (step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When the operation of the &ldquo;2&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not judged to be operated, whether &ldquo;3&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated or not (step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is determined. When operation on the &ldquo;3&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is recognized, the process advances to a third processing (step <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When the operation of the &ldquo;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not judged to be operated, whether &ldquo;4&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated or not (step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) is determined. When operation on the &ldquo;4&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is recognized, the process advances to a fourth processing (step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When the operation of the &ldquo;4&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not judged to be operated, whether &ldquo;5&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated or not (step <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) is determined. When operation on the &ldquo;5&rdquo; key of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is recognized, the process advances to a fifth processing (step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The operation of the predetermined operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is sequentially judged as in the above (step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), and the control process corresponding to the operated operation key is conducted (step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). Incidentally, when no operation on the operation keys <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is recognized, the recognizing process of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is repeated back in the step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The first processing is a process for functioning the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as a data logger for reading and sequentially storing the obtained, i.e. the measured measurement data by the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the controller checks the connection with the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). When the connection with the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is confirmed in the step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the controller sequentially reads in the measurement data from the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a real-time manner (step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). Specifically, the controller converts the measurement data into the data format used by the controller in the control processing software, i.e. the same data format as the signal transmitted and received by the communicator to/from the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and reads in the converted measurement data Incidentally, when it is judged that the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not connected in the step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the controller does not conduct read-in operation of the measurement data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Then, the controller controls the display means to sequentially display the read measured data on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). The controller may directly display the read measurement data or, alternatively, arithmetically process with the previously read measurement data to display in a graph. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the read measurement data is sequentially stored in the memory (step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) and operation button (not shown) of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is operated to determine whether suspension of obtaining the measurement data, i.e. the measurement, by the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is commanded or not (step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>). When the operation for suspending the measurement is recognized in the step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, storing and reading the measurement data is suspended to terminate the first processing. When it is judged that the suspension operation of the measurement is not conducted in the step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, judging that the measurement has not been terminated yet, the measurement data is sequentially read in back to the step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> After terminating the first processing, the process returns again to the recognition of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The second processing is a process where the measurement data measured by the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be commonly used on the web site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when the second processing is selected, the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated to select real-time processing or batch processing (step <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). The real-time processing refers to sequential transmission of the read measurement data to the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in a real-time manner. The batch processing refers to collectively transmitting the once read measurement data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When the controller recognizes that the batch processing is selected in the step <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which one of measurement data among the stored measurement data is transmitted is selected (step <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). Specifically, selection is urged to an operator by displaying that selection of which one of measurement data is to be transmitted is possible. Subsequently, the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated to transmit the measurement data to the predetermined address space of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>). Specifically, the controller controls the communicator so that the measurement data is transmitted to the predetermined address space of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>). In other words, the controller controls the communicator to let the selected measurement data among the measurement data stored in the memory be transmitted to the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be stored in the data storage <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the measurement data is stored so that the data is displayed on a predetermined area on the web site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the predetermined operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is operated to determine whether operation for suspending the transmission of the measurement data is conducted or not (step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). When the suspension of transmitting the measurement data is recognized in the step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the transmission control of the measurement data by batch processing is terminated. When it is judged that the operation for suspending transmission of the measurement data is not conducted in the step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, judging that the transmission of the measurement data has not been terminated, transmission of the measurement data is continued by returning to the step <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, in order to transmit the other measurement data by returning to the step <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the process may be returned to the selection of measurement data to be transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the controller recognizes the selection of the real-time processing in the step <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the controller checks the connection with the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>). When the controller confirms the connection of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the measurement data is read from the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a real-time manner (step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>). Incidentally, when it is judged that the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not connected in the step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the controller does not read in the measurement data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The controller controls the display means to display the sequentially read measurement data on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>). The controller may directly display the read measurement data or may arithmetically process with the previously read measurement data to display in a graph. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the read measurement data is sequentially stored in the memory (step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>). The controller further transmits the read measurement data to the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in a real-time manner (step <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Then, whether operation for suspending the measurement by operating the operation button (not shown) of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or tee operation for suspending the transmission of the measurement data by operating the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is conducted or not is determined (step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). When suspension of the measurement or the transmission is recognized in the step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the real-time transmission of the measurement data is stopped. Incidentally, when suspension of the measurement or the transmission is not recognized in the step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, judging that the real-time reading and transmitting of the measurement data has not been completed, the read-in operation of the measurement data is continued by returning to the step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The measurement data stored in the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the second processing can be browsed on the web site. Specifically, when the measurement data is browsed by the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the communicator is controlled by operating the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to access to the web site incorporating the measurement data of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The screen of the web site is displayed on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by accessing to the web site. Then, the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operated so that the controller controls the communicator to read the measurement data stored in the data storage <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and store in the memory. Incidentally, the measurement data may not be obtained by the mobile communications terminal but may be obtained by accessing the web site through public telephone network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the measurement data can be obtained by a mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> other than the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from which the measurement data is transmitted to the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the mobile <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is operated to arithmetically process the measurement data by the operation processing software or to connect to the computer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for arithmetic processing and accumulation of the measurement data by the computer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> After completing the second processing, the process returns again to the operation of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Incidentally, the measurement data read by the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may not be stored in the memory but may be transferred by the communicator to the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or other destination through the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the third processing, the step data indicating measurement step of the measuring instrument which is stored in the data storage <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> etc. in advance is taken into the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to be served for assisting measurement Specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, when the third processing is selected, the controller controls the communicator to connect to the predetermined web site of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and receive, i.e. download the measurement program as a step data of the measurement step stored in the web site in advance (step <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, while the measurement program is running, the operation key is operated to select offline processing and synchronization processing (step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). The offline processing refers to a process where the measuring instrument is not synchronized with the downloaded measurement program but uses the measurement program as, so to speak, an instruction manual for conducting measurement. The synchronization processing refers to a process where the measurement program is synchronized with the measuring instrument and the measuring instrument conducts measurement based on the measurement program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> When the controller recognizes that the offline processing is selected in the step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the control program executes the measurement program and controls the display means to display the measurement steps (step <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>). Subsequently, the controller determines whether the predetermined operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is operated to stop displaying the measurement step or not (step <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>). When the operation for stopping display of the measurement step is recognized in the step <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the measurement step display by the offline processing is terminated. Incidentally, when the controller does not recognize the operation for terminating the measurement step display, the display is continued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the controller recognizes that the synchronization processing is selected in the step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the controller checks the connection with the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>). When the connection with the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is detected in the step <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the measurement program is executed and the display means is controlled to display the measurement step and measurement condition etc (step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). The connected measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is controlled by executing the measurement program and the measurement is automatically started in accordance with the measurement step. The measurement data obtained by the measurement operation of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is sequentially read by the controller (step <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>) and is stored in the memory (step <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, whether termination of the measurement program and suspension of the measurement by operating the operation button (not shown) of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the predetermined operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are conducted or not is determined (step <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>). When the termination of the measurement program or the operation for suspending the measurement is recognized in the step <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the synchronization processing is stopped. When the termination of the measurement program or the operation for suspending the measurement is not recognized in the step <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the process returns to the step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to continue measurement to read and store the measurement data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> After completing the third processing, the process returns to the recognition of the operation of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Incidentally, in conducting the synchronization processing of the third processing, the measurement data of the second processing may be simultaneously transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The fourth processing is a process where the measurement error generated when the measurement instrument is automatically operated to sequentially transfer the measurement data is reported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, when the fourth processing is selected, the controller checks connection with the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>). When the connection with the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is determined, the use of the telephone network or electronic mail is selected by the operator for reporting the measurement error (step <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When the controller recognizes the operation for using the telephone network in the step <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the controller monitors the measurement by the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>). Incidentally, in the step <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the measurement error of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is read as a measurement data without acquiring actual measurement data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> During the monitoring condition in the step <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the presence of measurement error signal from the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a measurement data is determined (step <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>). When no measurement error is recognized, the process returns to the step <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to continue monitoring the measurement condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> When the controller recognizes the measurement error, the communicator is controlled to send a signal indicating generation of the measurement error to a predetermined destination stored in the memory in advance using the telephone network through the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>) to terminate the fourth processing. The signal indicating the generation of the measurement error is sent in a vocal data stored in the memory to the destination using telephone or mobile communications terminal using public telephone network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the controller recognizes the operation for using the electronic mail in the step <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the measurement condition is monitored in the same manner as the step <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> During the monitoring process of the step <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the presence of the measurement error signal in the form of the measurement data from the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is determined (step <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>). When the measurement error is not recognized, the monitoring of the measurement condition is continued by returning to the step <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> When the controller recognizes the measurement error, the communicator is controlled to transmit an electronic mail that indicates the measurement error to a predetermined mail address memorized in the memory in advance through the base station (step <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>) terminate the fourth processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> After completing the fourth processing, the process returns to the recognition of the operation of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Incidentally, during the fourth processing, the reading process of the measurement data in the tint processing, the transmission process of the measurement data in the second processing and the synchronization process of the third processing may be conducted simultaneously with monitoring the measurement condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The fifth processing is a process where the measurement data such as the measurement condition is read for examining the cause of the measurement error occurred in measurement by the measuring instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the fifth processing is selected, the controller checks the connection with the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in which the measurement error is occurred (step <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>). When the controller determines that the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected in the step <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the controller reads the measurement condition and measurement data stored in the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to store in the memory (step <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the controller controls the communicator and transmits the read measurement condition and the measurement data to a predetermined mail address stored in the memory in advance (step <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>). After completing the fifth processing, the process returns to recognition of operation of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Incidentally, the operation for transmitting measurement condition and measurement data of the fifth processing may be conducted simultaneously with transmission of the measurement error signal in the fourth processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described embodiment, following advantages can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> When the controller recognizes a predetermined operation of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the measurement data measured by the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is read after being converted into the same format as the signal transmitted and received by the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the communicator and the read measurement data is transmitted to and stored in a predetermined address space of the data storage <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the communicator. Accordingly, by connecting the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and operating the predetermined operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the measurement data can be sequentially stored in the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, so that it is not necessary to provide a separate computer system having large capacity storage and the measurement data can be transmitted and stored in an existing measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Further, it is not necessary to store the measurement data, so that the measurement data can be easily transmitted and received, thereby enhancing processing efficiency of the measurement data. Especially, the measurement data can be handled by the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such as a cellular phone, even when large amount of the memory area is consumed by main function as a telephone and the area for storing the measurement data is limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Further, the measurement data measured by the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is read after being converted into the same data format as the signal transmitted and received by the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the communicator and the read measurement data is transmitted to the other communications terminal by the communicator through the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> when the controller recognizes a predetermined operation of she operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the measurement data can be obtained and processed at a place other than the measurement site of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the processing efficiency of the measurement data can be improved. Further, since the measurement data is preserved in the communication terminal to which the data is transmitted, it is not necessary to store the measurement data Especially, the measurement data can be handled by the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such as a cellular phone, even when large amount of the memory area is consumed by main function as a telephone and the area for storing the measurement data is limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The read measurement data is stored in the memory of the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by the controller <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the measurement data can be administered and processed by the mobile communication terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from which the measurement data is transmitted, thereby enhancing the processing efficiency of the measurement data. Further, transmitting method of the measurement data can be changed in accordance with the processing of the measurement data, where the measurement data can be collectively transmitted and can be transmitted in a real-time manner simultaneously with reading the measurement data, thereby improving handlability of the measurement data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> When the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> fails to obtain the measurement data and the measurement data cannot be read, the controller controls the communicator to tryout a measurement error signal indicating that measurement data cannot be obtained to the other communications terminal through the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the measurement error of failing to obtain the measurement data can be easily recognized at a place other than the measurement site, so that the measurement error can be rapidly responded and the measurement data can be securely obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The communicator is controlled by the controller by operating the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to receive the step data stored in the data storage <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to display the data on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the display means of the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the measurement data can be easily obtained by the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby improving efficiency of obtaining and reading operation of the measurement data and improving processing efficiency of the measurement data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The communicator is controlled by the controller by a predetermined operation of the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to read the measurement program as a software stored in advance in the data storage <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for implementing the measurement operation of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it is only necessary for measurement that the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having read the measurement program is connected to the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to execute the measurement program, so that a worker without being skilled in the measuring method of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can easily obtain the measurement data. Further, the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be automatically operated to conduct measurement, thereby facilitating to acquire the measurement data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The operation processing software for arithmetically processing the measurement data is provided to the controller. Accordingly, the measurement data read by the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be displayed in a graph after arithmetically processing to facilitate the examination of the measurement result, or the measurement data can be transmitted after being arithmetically processed to reduce the load for processing the measurement data at the transmitted destination, thereby improving, processability and handlability of the measurement data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the scope of the present embodiment is not restricted to the above-described embodiment but modifications shown below are also included in the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is not restricted to a cellular phone and PHS but may be any mobile communications device. Further, the operation key <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may not be button type, but any arrangement used for the body of the mobile communication device such as liquid crystal touch panel and joystick is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Though the memory is provided to the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the memory such as a memory card may be detachably attached to the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the measurement data may be stored in the memory. Further, the control processing software and the operation processing software or step data and measurement program for implementing measurement of the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as the step data may be stored in the detachable memory and executed by reading out from the memory. According to the above arrangement, the existing mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such as a cellular phone and PHS can be used only by attaching the memory to the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in order to improve processing efficiency of the measurement data and use various software and programs corresponding to various measuring instruments <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby improving applicability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Though the display means is provided to the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the display means may be omitted and only the vocalizer may be provided as in a radio. Further, the display means is not restricted to the liquid crystal panel but may be any display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Though the control processing software is constructed in the mobile communication terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, i.e. memorized in the memory to be executed, the control processing software may be set in the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for reading the measurement data and the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be connected with the measuring instrument via cable or wireless for reading the measurement data by the controller of the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. According to the above arrangement, existing mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such as a cellular phone and PHS can be used only by connecting the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the measuring instrument <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order to enhance processing efficiency of the measurement data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The measurement data reader is not restricted to the control processing software but may be arranged in any manner such as a hardware of a circuit board mounted with electrical components where the mobile communications terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> converts the measurement data into the same format as the signal capable of transmitting and receiving from the base station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the communicator.
