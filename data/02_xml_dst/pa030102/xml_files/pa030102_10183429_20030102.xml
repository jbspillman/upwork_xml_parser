<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an endoscope system adapted to manage data of a plurality of endoscopes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There are endoscopes provided with a solid state imaging device for capturing images inside human body. Such endoscopes, so called electronic endoscopes, are normally connected to a processor that transforms the output signals from the solid state imaging device into image signals so that output devices such as monitors and video printers can display or print the image captured by the solid state imaging device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The endoscope is connected detachably to the processor so that the endoscope can be changed to a suitable type in accordance with the location of the human body to be inspected or treated with the endoscope. That is, the endoscope and the processor can be used in various combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The endoscope is usually provided with a memory, such as an EEPROM, into which various kinds of data related to the endoscope are stored. Data stored into the memory includes, for example, type and serial number of the endoscope, and calibration data for adjusting the white balance of the image captured by the solid state imaging device. The calibration data for adjusting the white balance includes the amount of brightness increase/decrease of red and blue colors, which will be referred hereinafter as to &ldquo;wb(r)&rdquo; and &ldquo;wb(b)&rdquo;, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The endoscope type and serial number are read by the processor as the endoscope is connected to it to display them on, for example, the monitor. The calibration data for white balance, wb(r) and wb(b), are also read by the processor to adjust the white balance of the image generated in the processor based on the output signals from the solid state imaging device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The white balance adjusting ability, however, are slightly different between each processor. Therefore, the processor often fails to achieve proper white balance by adjusting the colors merely in accordance with the calibration data obtained from the endoscope. In such case, proper white balance is achieved by performing manually a fine adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Recently, processors have been developed that are provided with a memory for storing the calibration data obtained as a result of the fine adjustment mentioned above. The calibration data is stored in the memory in association with data intrinsic to the endoscope such as serial number as a dataset like a database so that the processor can utilize the calibration data if the endoscope is connected and used again in the future. In this way, the processor eliminates the necessity of repetitive manual fine adjustment of the white balance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The number of endoscopes, however, of which data can be registered to the memory of the processor is restricted because of the finite available memory space thereof. Thus, if there is not available memory space for storing data of a new endoscope, unimportant data such as that of old or seldom used endoscopes should be deleted manually to free up memory space. Such manual operation is a cumbersome task and may cause deletion of important data such as that of new or frequently used endoscopes for lack of proper care. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For example, there are endoscopes purchased and endoscopes leased for a certain term. The leased endoscopes, in particular, endoscopes leased for a short term tends to quickly increase the number of registered endoscopes until the memory is filled. The data of such leased endoscopes remain in the memory even after the leased term is over and prevent the registration of a new purchased endoscope of which data registration should take precedence to the that of leased endoscope&apos;s data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, if the data filling the memory includes both data of purchased and leased endoscopes, the manual operation for registering new endoscope data may cause deletion of purchased endoscope data instead of data of the endoscope leased in the past and already returned. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides the advantage in that, in an endoscope system, new endoscope data is automatically registered in a database of endoscopes&apos; data without requiring cumbersome manual operation even if the database is full. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An endoscope system according to an aspect of the invention includes a processor connectable to various endoscopes to process signals generated by the endoscope being connected via a connector. The processor includes a database, a data selector and a data register. The database is configured to be registered a plurality of pieces of endoscope data, each of which being related to different one of the endoscopes connectable to the connector. Each piece of the endoscope data includes priority information indicating the priority of deleting the piece of endoscope data. The data selector selects one piece of the endoscope data based on the priority information. The data register registers a new endoscope with the database by replacing the selected piece of endoscope data with the piece of endoscope data of the new endoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus, even if there isn&apos;t any available storage space in the database, the endoscope system can register a new endoscope with the database without deleting data of relatively important endoscopes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the priority information includes the date of when the piece of endoscope data is registered with the database. In this case, the priority information may include the date of when the endoscope is connected to the processor for the first time as the date of when the piece of endoscope data is registered with the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the priority information includes the date of when the endoscope is used for the last time. In this case, the priority information may include the date of when the endoscope is connected to the processor for the last time as the date of when the endoscope is used for the last time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the above two optional cases, the data selector may select the piece of endoscope data related to the priority information including the oldest date, since such data may be related to old endoscopes or endoscopes seldom used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, an endoscope system is provided which has an endoscope and a processor to be connected to the endoscope to process signals generated by the endoscope. The processor includes, a storage device, a data receiver, a database selector, and a data register. The storage device includes a plurality of databases. The data receiver receives first and second data related to the endoscope, the second data includes information on the property of said endoscope. The database selector selects one of the databases in the storage device based on the second data. The data register registers the endoscope with the selected database by storing at least the first data into the selected database so that the endoscope is registered with the database corresponding to the property of the endoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Each of said plurality of databases may be defined in a different data file, or in a different single continuous storage area of said storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the data register is adapted to store priority information of the endoscope into the selected database in association with the first data. In case the selected database does not have available storage space for storing the first and second data, the data register selects one of the first and second data previously stored in the database based on the priority information to replace it with the first and second data received by the data receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The priority information may include the date of when the endoscope data is stored into the selected database. For example, the priority information includes the date of when the endoscope is connected to the processor for the first time as the date of when the endoscope data is stored into the selected database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the priority information may include the date of when the endoscope is used for the last time. For example, the priority information includes the date of when the endoscope is connected to the processor as said date of when the endoscope is used for the last time, which is updated when the endoscope is connected to the processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the case the priority information includes the date described above, the data register may select the endoscope data related to the priority information including the oldest date. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the processor further includes a text information generator for displaying text information on an monitor connected to the processor. The text information generator generates the text information on the property of the endoscope based on the second data. The text information generator displays the text information on the monitor when the endoscope is in use. Therefore, the operator using the endoscope can confirm the property of the endoscope on the monitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The data register may store the second data into the selected database in association with the first data, so that the text information generator can obtain the second data from the selected database when the endoscope is in use and display the text information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The processor may include a video signal generator which generates video signal from output signals of an imaging device provided to the endoscope. The video signal generator may generate that video signal as the endoscope is connected to the processor to display an image captured by the imaging device on the monitor at the same time the text information is displayed. The endoscope information may be superimposed on the image captured by the imaging device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The data receiver may receive the first and second data from a memory provided to the endoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the data receiver may receive the first data from a memory provided to the endoscope while the second data from an input unit which can be manually operated by an operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the second data includes information on the ownership of the endoscope. For example, the second data includes information on whether or not the endoscope is purchased. Alternatively, the second data includes information on whether or not the endoscope is leased. In the later case, the second data may include information on whether or not the endoscope is leased for a term longer than a predetermined term. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The first data may include information for adjusting white balance of an image captured by an imaging device provided to the endoscope.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> At first, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> initializes a variable &ldquo;current_scope&rdquo; to 0 (S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). The variable &ldquo;current<highlight><subscript>13</subscript></highlight>scope&rdquo; is for storing the &ldquo;register no.&rdquo; of the record in which the data of the endoscope currently connected to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are stored. If 0 is assigned to &ldquo;current_scope&rdquo;, it represents that no endoscope is currently connected to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> After the initialization of &ldquo;current_scope&rdquo;, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> waits until the electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> if there isn&apos;t any (S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> If the electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>: Yes), the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> accesses to the EEPROM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and obtains the data stored therein (S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). Next, the first and second signal processors transform the output signal from the CCD <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> into video signal to display the image captured by the CCD (S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Then, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> displays the &ldquo;scope name&rdquo; of the currently connected electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on the monitor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). Further, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> opens one of the data files in the memory <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>O), and then stores the data obtained from the EEPROM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> therein (S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Next, the white balance of the image captured by the CCD <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is adjusted using the calibration value (&ldquo;wb(r)&rdquo;, &ldquo;wb(b)&rdquo;) obtained form the EEPROM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>). That is, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sends the calibration value of &ldquo;wb(r)&rdquo; and &ldquo;wb(b)&rdquo; to the second signal processor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> so that the second signal processor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> adjusts the color balance of the image signals generated there. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> After S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the processor watches whether the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is still connected, and as long as the electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is still connected to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>:Yes), the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> displays the current date and time on the monitor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>), and also performs various kinds of adjustments in accordance with manual operation by the operator (S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In scope name displaying routine, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> first decides whether the currently connected endoscope is a purchased one or a leased one. This is done by checking the value of &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; obtained from the EEPROM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> If &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; indicates the endoscope is purchased, i.e., &ldquo;ownership&rdquo;&equals;0, then CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sends the alphanumeric characters of the &ldquo;scope name&rdquo; obtained from the EEPROM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the CRT controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to superimpose the type of the electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on the image captured by the CCD <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and displayed on the monitor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

This is achieved by searching within the data file opened in S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for a record including data that matches the &ldquo;scope name&rdquo; and &ldquo;serial no.&rdquo; obtained from the EEPROM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> If there is a record including the above mentioned data (S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>:Yes), it means the data of the electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> currently connected is already registered with the memory <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In this case, the &ldquo;register no.&rdquo; of the record found is set to &ldquo;current_scope&rdquo; (S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) and the operation of the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> proceeds to S<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> which will be described latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> If a record including the above mentioned data is not found, it means the electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is not yet registered (S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>:No).

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In this routine, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> checks whether or not the date and time information of a variable &ldquo;date &amp; time&rdquo; indicates the exact time by comparing &ldquo;date &amp; time&rdquo; with the date and time information from the RTC <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> If the difference between the two pieces of the date and time information is less than a second, then the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> decides the two pieces of the date and time information are same (S<highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>:Yes).

<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing a subroutine ADJUSTMENT in S<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the main routine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This routine is for allowing the operator to manually adjust the white balance of the image captured by the CCD <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the opening size of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In this routine, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> decides whether or not the adjustment of white balance is requested by checking the signals from the keyboard <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the operation panel <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and the operation buttons <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>). If there is a request (S<highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>:Yes), then the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> rewrites the value of the &ldquo;wb(r)&rdquo;, &ldquo;wb(b)&rdquo; in the record specified by &ldquo;current scope&rdquo; in accordance with the signal from the keyboard <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the operation panel <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, or the operation buttons <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>). Further, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sends the value of latest &ldquo;wb(r)&rdquo; and &ldquo;wb(b)&rdquo; to the second signal processor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> so that the second signal processor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> re-adjusts the white balance of the image generated there (S<highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> After the execution of S<highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> or in the case there isn&apos;t any request for white balance adjustment (S<highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>:No), the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> checks again the output signals from the keyboard <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the operation panel <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and the operation buttons <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to decide whether or not the adjustment of diaphragm is requested (S<highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> If there is a request (S<highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>:Yes), then the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> opens/closes the diaphragm <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, via the diaphragm controller <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the request from the keyboard <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the operation panel <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, or the operation buttons <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to control the amount of light introduced into the light guide <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> If there isn&apos;t any request (S<highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>:No), the operation of the processor returns to the main flow of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the operation of processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> may be modified in many ways within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> For example, S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the subroutine ENDOSCOPE REGISTRATION shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> may be replaced with a step that specifies the &ldquo;register no.&rdquo; of the record including the oldest &ldquo;used date &amp; time&rdquo; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> (see S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>*). If S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is replaced with S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>*, the data related to the endoscope not used recently, and may have the lowest possibility to be used again in the future, is deleted to free up memory space for registering data of the new endoscope. Further, S<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> may also be canceled if data is overwritten in S<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The manner of managing the data in the memory <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may also be modified in many ways. For example, a plurality of areas may be defined within one data file of the memory <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and data of the electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be registered in the area corresponding to the feature of the electronic endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> indicated by &ldquo;ownership&rdquo;, &ldquo;spec&rdquo;, and/or &ldquo;expiration&rdquo;, or any data inputted manually into the keyboard <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> schematically shows an address map of the memory <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in which two data areas are defined in one data file as second embodiment of the invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the memory <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> includes a data file <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, and first and second data areas <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are defined within the data file <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The first data area <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extends from address <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1499</bold></highlight> (in decimal system), and the second data area <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from address <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2999</bold></highlight> (in decimal system). Each of first and second data areas <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> records having same format as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The first and second data areas <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are for registering data related to purchased endoscopes and leased endoscopes, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> If the memory <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is managed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> should be modified as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> That is, in the subroutine FILE OPEN (S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>), the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> opens the data file <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). Next, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> checks the state of &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; obtained from EEPROM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). If &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; is 0 (S<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>:Yes), indicating the endoscope is purchased, then the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sets a variable &ldquo;offset&rdquo; to 0 (S<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>). &ldquo;Offset&rdquo; is used later as an address start to reading the memory <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. If &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; is 1 or 2, indicating the endoscope is leased, then the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sets &ldquo;offset&rdquo; to 1500. After the execution of S<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> or S<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, the operation of the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> returns to the main flow shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to execute the subroutine ENDOSCOPE REGISTRATION (S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In the subroutine ENDOSCOPE REGISTRATION (S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are replaced with S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>*, S<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>*, S<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>*, and S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>*, respectively. Other steps are same as that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The contents of S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>*, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>*, S<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>*, and S<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>* are same as that of the replaced steps except that the memory area that the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can treat is limited to the address &ldquo;offset&rdquo; through &ldquo;offset&rdquo;&plus;1499. That is, if &ldquo;offset&rdquo; is set to 0 in the subroutine FILE OPEN (S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>), then the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can read, write, and delete data only within the first data area <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the memory <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and if &ldquo;offset&rdquo; is 1500, then the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can handle the data only in the second data area <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, if a new leased endoscope, for example, is connected to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> never accesses to the first data area <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and thus never deletes data of purchased endoscopes, which may be more important than data of leased endoscopes, in order to register leased endoscopes&apos; data. </paragraph>
