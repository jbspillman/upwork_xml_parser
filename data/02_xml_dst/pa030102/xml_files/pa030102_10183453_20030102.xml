<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a method of operating and controlling a mobile base station in mobile communications systems, and particularly relates to a method of operating and controlling a mobile base station by controlling the operation of a mobile base station connected to a mobile communications system via a wireless relay channel by taking into account radio interference with another base station that is fixedly installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention relates to a mobile base station to which such a method of operating and controlling a mobile base station is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When a base station is to be newly installed in the mobile communications system, simulation or analysis is conducted regarding radio interference between the newly installed base station and existing base stations in the surrounding area. Based on the findings, operation conditions are determined, including radio communication characteristics such as a frequency to be used, codes to be used, a transmission power, a directionality of radio transmission, and so on, in order to use the new base station in the mobile communications system. The newly installed base station is then operated according to the operation conditions inclusive of the radio communication characteristics that were determined for the mobile communications system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are cases in which a mobile base station linked to the mobile communications system via the wireless relay function is to be temporarily installed in an area where a temporal surge of traffic is expected. In such a case, it is not desirable to conduct simulation or analysis regarding radio interference with existing base stations for the purpose of determining the operation conditions each time such a temporary base station is to be installed. If such simulation or analysis must be conducted prior to every such installment, the installment of mobile base stations cannot be conducted with sufficient flexibility and promptness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A base station that is installed in a vehicle such as a land vehicle, a ship, and an aircraft (such a base station is also referred to as a mobile base station) may be located outside the communication area covered by the fixed base stations of the mobile communications system. For example, a mobile base station installed in a ship on the sea may be operated without taking into account radio interference with the base stations that are fixedly installed on the land. If the vehicle enters the communication area covered by the fixed base stations, such as when the ship makes a stop at a bay, it may be possible to have radio interference between the mobile base station of the vehicle and the fixed base stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid such radio interference, operation conditions of the mobile base station may be determined in advance by the method as previously described. Even when the mobile base station is operated based on the operation conditions determined in such a manner, however, the movement of the mobile base station to a new point different from the expected point may still create radio interference between the mobile base station and the fixed base stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, after the operation conditions of the mobile base station are determined with respect to a given point, the operative conditions of the fixed base stations may change in the mobile communications system, or the arrangement of the fixed base stations may change. In such a base, the mobile base station operated according to the predetermined operation conditions may create interference with the fixed base stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a method of controlling the operation of a mobile base station that makes it possible to properly control the operation of the mobile base station regardless of the position thereof in the mobile communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, there is a need for a mobile base station to which such a method of controlling the operation of a mobile base station is applied. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is a general object of the present invention to provide a method of controlling the operation of a mobile base station that substantially obviates one or more of the problems caused by the limitations and disadvantages of the related art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is another and more specific object of the present invention to provide a method of controlling the operation of a mobile base station that achieves proper control of the mobile base station regardless of the position thereof in the mobile communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Further, it is still another object of the present invention to provide a mobile base station to which such a method of controlling the operation of a mobile base station is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above objects according to the present invention, a method of controlling an operation of a mobile base station that is linked to a mobile communication system via a wireless relay channel includes an information acquiring step of acquiring estimation-purpose base information for estimating a condition of radio interference between the mobile base station and one or more other base stations, the acquisition of the estimation-purpose base information being made by the mobile base station and involving measurement of a physical property responsive to a current position of the mobile base station, an estimation step of estimating the condition of radio interference based on the acquired estimation-purpose base information, and a control step of controlling an operation of the mobile base station based on the estimated condition of radio interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The method of controlling the operation of a mobile base station acquires the estimation-purpose base information at the current position of the mobile base station, and estimates the condition of radio interference between the mobile base station and other base stations based on the acquired estimation-purpose base information. Based on the estimated condition of radio interference, the operation of the mobile base station is controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the condition of radio interference between the mobile base station and other base stations can be estimated in real-time wile following changes of the position of the mobile base station as it moves, and the operation of the mobile base station is controlled based on the real-time estimates of radio interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A wireless relay channel that links the mobile base station to the mobile communication system can be any relay channel at least partially including a wireless channel. Such wireless relay channel may include a satellite relay channel, a terrestrial microwave relay channel, a channel of another mobile communication system, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention that places an emphasis on easier estimation of radio interference, the method as described above is such that the information acquiring step measures the position of the mobile base station as the estimation-purpose base information, and the estimation step estimates the condition of radio interference by assessing a relative positional relationship between the measured position of the mobile base station and positions of the one or more other mobile stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The relative positional relationship (e.g., defined in terms of distances and directions) between the measured position of the mobile base station and the positions of other base stations provides an estimate of the condition of radio interference by using a set of predetermined assumptions regarding radio characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention that places an emphasis on reliable estimation of radio interference, the method as described above is such that the information acquiring step measures one or more radio waves received by the mobile base station from one or more neighboring base stations as the estimation-purpose base information, and the estimation step estimates the condition of radio interference by comparing the measured radio waves with a radio wave to be used by the mobile base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the method of controlling the operation of the mobile base station described above, the condition of radio interference is estimated by comparing the actually measured radio waves with the radio wave to be used by the mobile base station, so that a reliable estimate can be obtained with regard to the condition of radio interference between the mobile base station and the other base stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A specific characteristic of the radio waves that is to be compared is not limited to any particular example, and can be any characteristic as long as it relates to radio interference. For example, a characteristic to be compared may be a radio frequency, or may be base-station-specific codes if the mobile communication system is based on the CDMA method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, the method as described above is such that the control step makes the mobile base station stay in a standby state in response to the estimated condition of radio interference that indicates presence of radio interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, the method as described above further includes a switching step of switching operation conditions of the mobile base station, wherein the control step controls the operation of the mobile base station according to an operation condition obtained by the switching step if the switching step obtains the operation condition that insures absence of radio interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The operation conditions described above are not limited to particular examples, and can be any conditions as long as they relate to the operation of the mobile base station, exemplary conditions including radio communication characteristics such as a frequency to be used, a code to be used, a transmission power, and a directionality of radio transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention that places an emphasis on self-reliant operation control, the method as described above is such that the estimation step is performed by the mobile base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention that places an emphasis on reducing the load on the mobile base station, the method as described above is such that the estimation step is performed by a facility of the mobile communication system based on the estimation-purpose base information supplied from the mobile base station to the facility via a wireless relay channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Further, the method as described above is such that the control step makes the facility generate operation control information based on the estimated condition of radio interference estimated by the facility, and controls the operation of the mobile base station based on the operation control information transferred from the facility to the mobile base station via the wireless relay channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The operation control information described above may include operation conditions indicative of what conditions are used for operation such as conditions regarding radio communication characteristics (e.g., a frequency to be used, a code to be used, a transmission power, and a directionality of radio transmission), and may also include information indicative of whether the mobile base station is in operation or not (i.e., in a standby state). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a mobile base station to be linked to a mobile communication system via a wireless relay channel includes an information acquiring unit which acquires estimation-purpose base information for estimating a condition of radio interference between the mobile base station and one or more other base stations, the acquisition of the estimation-purpose base information involving measurement of a physical property responsive to a current position of the mobile base station, an estimation unit which estimates the condition of radio interference based on the acquired estimation-purpose base information, and a control unit which controls an operation of the mobile base station based on the estimated condition of radio interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a mobile base station to be linked to a mobile communication system via a wireless relay channel includes an information acquiring unit which acquires estimation-purpose base information for estimating a condition of radio interference between the mobile base station and one or more other base stations, the acquisition of the estimation-purpose base information involving measurement of a physical property responsive to a current position of the mobile base station, a transferring unit which transfers the estimation-purpose base information to a facility of the mobile communication system via a wireless relay channel, and a control unit which controls an operation of the mobile base station according to operation control information received from the facility via the wireless relay channel, the operation control information being produced by the facility based on the estimated condition of radio interference estimated by the facility. </paragraph>

Based on the search findings, the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> checks whether the radio waves found in this manner include the same frequency that the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is supposed to use for its own communication (step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). If the radio waves found in the above-specified manner do not include the same frequency that the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is supposed to use for its own communication (NO at step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), it is ascertained that no radio interference occurs in relation to the neighboring base stations. The base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is thus set in operation to communicate with other mobile stations by transmitting the radio of that frequency (step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> informs the monitor-&amp;-control station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via the relay channel apparatus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the satellite relay channel, and the satellite base station <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that communication by use of the radio of that frequency is now possible (step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). In this manner, the monitor-&amp;-control station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> learns the operative state of the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and identifies the frequency to be used, followed by engaging in the operation to monitor the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is operated by using the radio wave of the above-noted frequency in the mobile communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If the radio waves found by the search include the same frequency that the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is supposed to use for its own communication (YES at step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), it is ascertained that radio interference occurs in relation to the neighboring base stations. In this case, the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> switches the frequency of radio waves used for its own communication to one of the frequencies that were identified in advance as usable in the mobile communication system (step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). Then, the radio search receiver <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> searches for radio waves received from the neighboring base stations (step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). The base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> checks whether the radio waves found in this manner include the same frequency that is selected by the switching of frequencies described above (step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> If the frequency selected by the switching of frequencies is included in the radio waves found by the search, the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> switches frequencies successively, and repeat checking whether the radio waves found by the search include the same frequency that is selected by the switching of frequencies. If the frequency selected by the switching of frequencies is not included in the radio waves found by the search (NO at step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), it is ascertained that no radio interference occurs in relation with the neighboring base stations. In this case, the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> starts the operation thereof by transmitting the radio wave of the frequency obtained by the switching of frequencies (step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Further, the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> informs the monitor-&amp;-control station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the start of operation using the frequencies obtained by the switching of frequencies (step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> If all the frequencies usable in the mobile communication system are included in the radio waves found by the search (YES at step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> engages in the state of suspended radio transmission, and informs the monitor-&amp;-control station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via the relay channel apparatus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the satellite relay channel, and the satellite base station <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that the operation thereof is brought into a standby state (step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Each time the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moves to a new position, the procedures as described above is performed. Accordingly, the procedure corresponding to steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is repeatedly performed when the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is moving outside the communication area covered by the fixed base stations (e.g., the base station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) of the mobile communication system, resulting in the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being set in the operative state. When the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> enters the communication area covered by the fixed base stations of the mobile communication system, the procedure corresponding to steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is performed, so that the frequency to be used is successively switched. If the switched frequency differs from any frequency of the radio waves found by the search, this frequency is used in operation (from step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to steps S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). If all the frequencies switched one after another match those of the radio waves found by the search, the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is brought into the standby state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> With the control of the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as described above, the radio waves transmitted from the neighboring base stations are actually searched for, and the frequencies of the radio waves found by the search are compared with the frequency to be used by the mobile base station so as to identify the condition of radio interference, thereby controlling the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> based on the identified condition (by switching between a standby state, a continued operation, and an operation after changing operation conditions). Accordingly, a properly controlled operation is achieved for the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in real-time even when the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moves to a new position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the above example, a description has been given with reference to a case in which the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is linked to a single mobile communication system.

In such a case, the same procedure as described above can be performed with respect to each of the mobile communication systems to which the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is to be installed, thereby achieving proper operation control of the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In this example, the condition of radio interference is estimated based on the relative positional relationship between the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and neighboring base stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the GPS apparatus <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> measures the position of the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> upon the power on (step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). The information about the position obtained in this manner is supplied to the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> refers to a database that includes the positions of fixed base stations of the mobile communication system (and the positions of other mobile base stations if necessary), and compares its own position with the positions of the base stations included in the database (step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). The database may be provided in the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the database may be provided in other facility of the mobile communication system such as the address input circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and is obtained by the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the satellite base station <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the satellite relay channel. It is desirable, however, that the database is easily updated to reflect changes when changes are made to the arrangement of the base stations in the mobile communication system, and the positions of other mobile base stations can be easily registered in the database. To this end, the database is preferably provided in some facility of the mobile communication system (e.g., the monitor-&amp;-control station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>), and is supplied to the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> each time the use thereof becomes necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> checks, based on the relative positional relationship between itself and the other base stations obtained as a result of the comparison, whether its own position is expected to create radio interference with the other base stations (step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). For example, the conditions that are expected to cause radio interference according to the analysis of radio transmission characteristics may be defined in advance in terms of a relative positional relationship (i.e., distances and directions) between the mobile base station and the other base stations. The check at step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is made by deciding whether these conditions are satisfied by the relative positional relationship between the actually measured position of the mobile base station and the database-registered positions of the other base stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> If the check finds that the position of the mobile base station does not cause radio interference (NO at step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> transmits radio waves (step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>), and the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is set in operation, followed by the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> reporting to the monitor-&amp;-control station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via the satellite relay channel that the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is now in operation (step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). If the monitor-&amp;-control station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is in the possession of the database regarding the positions of base stations, for example, the reporting to the monitor-&amp;-control station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as described above is accompanied by the information about the position of the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> If the check finds that the position of the mobile base station causes radio interference (YES at step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> engages in the state of suspended radio transmission, and informs the monitor-&amp;-control station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via the satellite relay channel that the operation thereof is brought into a standby state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> According to the operation control described above, the condition of radio interference is estimated based on the relative relationship between the position of the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the positions of the other base stations where such a relative positional relationship is relatively easy to obtain.

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, upon the power-on operation, radio waves received from neighboring base stations are searched for (step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). A check is then made as to whether the radio signals found by the search include a radio wave of the same frequency that the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is supposed to use (step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>).

The information about the position obtained in this manner is supplied to the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> refers to a database that includes the positions and assigned codes of fixed base stations of the mobile communication system (and the positions and employed codes of other mobile base stations if necessary), and compares its own position and code with the positions and codes of the base stations included in the database (step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> further checks whether the base-station-specific codes obtained by decoding the signals of the radio waves found by the search include the code of the above code setting (step S<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> With the control of the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as described above, the radio frequencies and codes used by the base stations surrounding the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are compared with the radio frequency and the code to be used by its own station so as to identify the condition of radio interference, thereby controlling the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> based on the identified condition (by switching between a standby state, a continued operation, and an operation after changing operation conditions). Accordingly, a properly controlled operation is achieved for the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in real-time even when the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moves to a new position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The operation control of the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to the various embodiments described above changes radio frequencies and codes to be used based on an estimate of radio interference with neighboring base stations, thereby controlling operation conditions. Notwithstanding these examples, the operation conditions may be controlled by modifying the transmission power of radio waves or the directionality of radio waves. Alternatively, more than one factor may be concurrently modified such as the directionality being changed concurrently with the transmission power, the frequency being changed simultaneously with the directionality, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Further, information used for estimating the condition of radio interference between the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the neighboring base stations includes the position of the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the frequencies of radio waves received from the neighboring base stations, and the codes included in these radio waves according to the embodiments described above. Notwithstanding these embodiments, the present invention is not limited to the use of any particular type of information for the estimation purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> For example, when the radio search receiver <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> receives radio waves from each mobile station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> residing around the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the condition of the received radio waves (e.g., the condition of reception levels) may indicate whether each mobile station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is communicating with base stations relatively close to the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In such a case, the condition of radio waves from each mobile station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (e.g., the condition of reception levels) can be used as estimation-purpose base information. Namely, it is estimated that radio interference with a given base station occurs if the reception level of a radio wave received from each mobile station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> indicates a presence of this given base station in a close proximity of the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Further, when the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> receives radio waves from the mobile station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> residing within the area of its communication coverage, it is possible to identify a base station with which the mobile station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is communicating, based on the information obtained by decoding the received radio waves. In this case, the condition of radio interference with this base station can be estimated based on the position of the base station or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> When the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> communicates with the mobile station <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> residing within its area of communication, the condition of radio interference with neighboring base stations can be estimated based on the degradation of communication quality. In this case, it is possible to estimate the condition of radio interference with high accuracy by using statistical data regarding the communication quality observed when the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is communicating while on the move. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Further, the above embodiments have been described with reference to a case in which the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> estimates the condition of radio interference based on the estimate-purpose base information such as frequencies, codes, and positions, and information to be used for operation control (inclusive of operation conditions such as a frequency and a code as well as a check determination regarding whether to engage in operation) is obtained based on the estimates. The mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then controls the operation thereof based on the information for operation control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to these particular examples. For example, the estimate-purpose base information (frequencies, codes, and positions) obtained by the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be transferred to the monitor controlling station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via the satellite relay channel, and the monitor controlling station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may generate the information to be used for operation control that includes operation conditions such as a frequency and a code as well as a check determination regarding whether to engage in operation. The information to be used for operation control generated in this manner may then be supplied to the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (i.e., the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) via the satellite relay channel, so that the mobile base station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (i.e., the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) can be operated according to the supplied operation control information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In such a configuration, the monitor controlling station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> performs steps S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. When the monitor controlling station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> obtains an estimate as a result of the check at step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that no radio interference occurs, the operative state thereof and the operation condition (frequency) are reported to the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is then operated according to the reported operation condition. When an estimate indicative of radio interference is obtained as a result of the check at step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the monitor controlling station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> sends to the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> the operation control information that indicates a standby state. Based on the operation control information, the base station apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> engages in the standby state. </paragraph>
