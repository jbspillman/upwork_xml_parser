<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In a trench MOS gate structure of a semiconductor device where trenches (T) are located between an n-type base layer (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and an n-type source layer (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), a p-type channel layer (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is formed adjacent to side walls of the trenches, having an even concentration distribution along a depthwise dimension of the trenches. The p-type channel layer enables saturation current to decrease without a raise of ON-resistance of the device, and resultantly a durability against short-circuit can be enhanced. The n-type source layer formed adjacent to the side walls of the trench also further enhances the durability against short-circuit. Providing contacts of the emitter electrode (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) with the n-type source layer at the side walls of the trenches permits a miniaturization of the device and a reduction of the ON-resistance as well. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-198551, filed on Jun. 29, 2001; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and its manufacturing method, and more particularly, it relates to a trench MOS (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) gate structure and a method of manufacturing it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A trench structure where trenches formed in semiconductor are utilized is applied to semiconductor devices such as IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) and MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor), and the structure has been recognized as being advantageous especially for a use in relation with supply and control of electric power. For instance, IGBT of the trench structure has both the properties of high level input impedance peculiar to MOSFETs and low saturation voltage unique to bipolar transistors, and it has been used in a wide range including blackout-free power supply, various motor driver unit, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing a vertical IGBT having a trench gate structure which was attempted by the Inventor of the present invention in the course of attaining this invention. A structure in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> of the trench IGBT will be outlined in terms of its manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> First, a p-type base layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is formed in the surface of an n-type base layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by means of diffusion, and the resultant surface is selectively superposed with an n-type source layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by diffusion. Then, after trenches T for MOS gates are formed, they are covered with a gate insulation film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and embedded with gate electrodes <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which is further superimposed with an insulation film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to isolate the gate electrodes at their respective tops. After that, windows are formed to create open contact regions, and then, an emitter electrode <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is created at the top. In the reverse or bottom side of the integrated substrate, a collector electrode <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> underlies a p-type emitter layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to attain a trench-type IGBT structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the trench MOS gate structure obtained in this manner, the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is shaped in a lattice pattern so as to electrically connect the emitter electrode <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Such a &ldquo;lattice&rdquo; pattern is useful in maximizing a MOS channel width and reducing an ON-resistance in the resultant device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the case of the IGBT shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, however, an increase in the MOS channel width leads to a rise of saturation current I<highlight><subscript>cp</subscript></highlight>, which in turn causes a reduction in durability against load short-circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As will be recognized, the trench IGBT shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> should have the lattice-shaped n-type source pattern to reduce the ON-voltage, and this results in the saturation current I<highlight><subscript>cp </subscript></highlight>being raised to eventually decrease the durability against short-circuit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor device comprising a base layer of a first conductivity type, a base layer of a second conductivity type created over the base layer of the first conductivity type, trenches each defined to penetrate the base layer of the second conductivity type and reach the base layer of the first conductivity type, a source layer of the first conductivity type selectively formed in the base layer of the second conductivity type, a channel layer of the second conductivity located between the base layer of the second conductivity and the trenches, having a higher impurity concentration level compared with the base layer of the second conductivity type, a gate insulation film covering inner wall surfaces of the trenches, gate electrodes located on the channel layer of the second conductivity type with an interposition of the gate insulation film between them, and a first primary electrode electrically connected to both the source layer of the first conductivity type and the base layer of the second conductivity type, and the channel layer of the second conductivity type has a generally uniform distribution of impurity concentration along depths of the trenches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> With the architecture as stated above, saturation current I<highlight><subscript>cp </subscript></highlight>can be reduced without a decrease in ON-resistance of the device so as to permit the device to have a sufficiently large durability against short-circuit.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Best modes of the present invention will be described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In the description hereinafter, although a vertical trench gate transistor is exemplified, the present invention should not be limited to that but is applicable to any semiconductor devices of MOS gate structures such as vertical trench IGBTs, lateral trench IGBTs, vertical trench MOSFETs, lateral trench MOSFETs, and the like. Also, in the description hereinafter, an example employing a combination of a first conductivity type for an n-type with a second conductivity type for a p-type will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A basic trench MOS gate structure for a semiconductor device, or a first preferred embodiment of the present invention will be detailed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a partially cut-away perspective view showing a module of the trench MOS gate structure for the semiconductor device according to the embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The major part of the structure will now be described. First, a p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed in an upper surface of an n-type base layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and an n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is selectively formed in the resultant surface. Additionally, a gate insulation film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is created over inner wall surfaces of trenches T for MOS gates, and the trenches T have their remaining spaces embedded with gate electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The trenches T have their respective tops covered with insulation film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and it is further superposed with an emitter electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In the reverse or bottom side of the device, a collector electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed to underlie a p-type emitter layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of the semiconductor device is significantly different from the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> in that a p-type channel layer is created in MOS channel regions adjacent to each of side walls of the trenches T. The p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a higher impurity concentration, compared with the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a distribution of the concentration throughout the channel layer is uniform along inner side walls of the trenches T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a graph showing a distribution of impurity concentration along depths of the trenches T. A lateral axis of the graph represents a distance from an opening level of the tops of the trenches T down to deeper portions thereof along the side walls while a vertical axis of the graph represents an impurity concentration. In this graph, Nb, Pch, and Ns respectively denote concentration distributions of n-type impurities in the n-type base layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, p-type impurities in the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and n-type impurities in the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the concentration of impurities contained in the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending downward along the side walls of the trenches is almost uniform throughout the channel layer, and a uniform profile of the impurity concentration is exhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a graph showing a distribution of impurity concentration along depths of the trenches T in the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> as a comparative example. In the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are created by diffusing impurities into substrate surfaces under appropriate heat control. Thus, a peak value (Cp<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>) of the impurity concentration of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is observed around a junction of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> while the concentration of the p-type impurities is reduced as a measurement point is closer to a junction of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the n-type base layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When the IGBT of such a trench gate structure experiences load short-circuit, supply voltage is applied to the collector electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>) of the device under ON-state. This allows short-circuit peak current I<highlight><subscript>cp </subscript></highlight>to flow in the device, and resultantly, the continuous ON-state under that condition for longer than a certain period of time t<highlight><subscript>sc </subscript></highlight>causes the device to be thermally broken down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Thus, in order to avoid thermal break-down of the device, the short-circuit peak current I<highlight><subscript>cp </subscript></highlight>must remain sufficiently low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, the IGBT of the embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> enables the short-circuit peak current I<highlight><subscript>cp </subscript></highlight>to decrease while keeping its ON-resistance sufficiently low, so that a durability against short-circuit can be enhanced. The principle will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the IGBT of the structure as exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, threshold voltage depends upon a dominant factor of the impurity concentration of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Specifically, in the course of applying positive voltage to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> relative to the emitter electrode <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, the applied voltage, when reaching the threshold voltage or even higher, causes the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the channel region to turn to be an inverted layer, and this enables the device to turn on. Thus, the threshold voltage depends upon the distribution of the impurity concentration in the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the embodiment of the invention, as recognized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the concentration distribution of the p-type impurities that dominates the threshold voltage is represented as a concentration distribution Pch in the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, being thoroughly uniform. It should be noted that the threshold voltage depends upon the entire region of the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In contrast, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when a concentration distribution Pb of the p-type impurities is not uniform, the threshold voltage is dominated by a region having a peak value of Cp<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As the ON-state IGBT has its collector voltage (V<highlight><subscript>ce</subscript></highlight>) raised, an electric potential of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> first rises in the junction with the n-type base layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> among other areas, and when it reaches the threshold voltage or higher, the acquired inverted layer cannot be retained any further. In such a condition, the potential is at pinch-off voltage to have the current flowing in the device at a saturation level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the concentration distribution Pch of the p-type impurities is uniform, the device is saturated with current upon a raise of potential up to the threshold level or higher around the junction with the n-type base layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In contrast, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the concentration distribution Pb of the p-type impurities is not uniform, the device is saturated with current upon a raise of potential up to the threshold level or higher around the junction with the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (around an area having a value Cp<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Assuming that both the IGBTs in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 13</cross-reference> have the same threshold voltage, voltage V<highlight><subscript>pinch</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>at which the device in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> according to the embodiment of the invention is saturated with current flowing therein is lower than voltage V<highlight><subscript>pinch </subscript></highlight>at which the comparative device in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is saturated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graph showing saturation current properties of both the IGBTs in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (embodiment of the invention) and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (comparative example). Since the collector voltage V<highlight><subscript>ce </subscript></highlight>at which the device of the embodiment of the invention is saturated is lower than the corresponding voltage at which the comparative device is saturated, the former device has a lower saturation current I<highlight><subscript>cp</subscript></highlight>, compared to the latter. For general understanding, when the concentration of the n-type impurities in the n-type base layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is low, and when the gate insulation film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is thin, the saturation current I<highlight><subscript>cp </subscript></highlight>and the saturation voltage V<highlight><subscript>pinch </subscript></highlight>are related as follows: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Thus, in accordance with the embodiment of the invention, creating the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the channel region adjacent to the side walls of the trenches as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the saturation current I<highlight><subscript>cp </subscript></highlight>of the IGBT can be reduced without any alteration in its ON-resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The width and location of the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending along the depth of the trench T is not limited to the aforementioned case where the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extends downward from the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> beyond the bottom of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> partially isolates the n-type base layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the side walls of the trench T. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A manufacturing method of the first embodiment of the semiconductor device, namely, a second preferred embodiment of the invention, will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view showing major stages of the exemplary manufacturing method; that is, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a process of producing the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In manufacturing the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, after the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is first formed by diffusing impurities in the substrate of the n-type base layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a mask insulation film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is selectively deposited over the surface of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for patterning to form the trenches T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> After that, the trenches T are defined and cleared down to the n-type base layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the p-type impurities (e.g., boron) are implanted into the side walls of the trenches. During the procedure, the wafer is tilted while impurity ions are introduced; that is, the ions are implanted at slant angle. In such a case, varying the angle at which the wafer is tilted enables control of a depth which the introduced impurities reach. Then, the introduced impurities are activated under thermal control so as to produce the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Although the width of the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending downward along the depth of the trench T is exemplified in a case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> as reaching a deeper level beyond the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it may be at a level above the bottom of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as mentioned above in relation with the Embodiment 1, to obtain the same effect of reduced saturation current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> (Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Another exemplary method of producing the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views showing major stages of an exemplary manufacturing process of the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a stage of patterning with the mask insulation film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and any of preceding stages thereto are similar to those in the Second Embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). In the succeeding stage, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A, a</cross-reference> shallow trench T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is tunneled down to a depth at which the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is to be formed, and thereafter, impurities are introduced by means of implantation at slant angle, vapor diffusion, solid state diffusion, or the like. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the trench is further tunneled into a deeper trench T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and undergoes a thermal control to create the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned way of the manufacturing process (Embodiment 2), the depth of the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is regulated by implanting the impurities at slant angle. However, the ion implantation must be repeated after the wafer is rotated by 180 degrees while regulating the wafer at a predetermined orientation, and this makes the process annoying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, this embodiment (Third Embodiment) provides an improved impurity implantation of reduced process restrictions and enhanced manufacturing efficiency in that it can be performed by means of a simplified and easy procedure such as vapor diffusion and solid state diffusion, except for the twice repeated stage in forming the trenches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> (Fourth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of manufacturing the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The background of this embodiment is as follows: In the comparative example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is produced by implanting n-type impurities into the surface of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As mentioned before in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the substrate must be masked as desired to shape the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into &ldquo;lattice&rdquo;. However, there often arises a risk of &ldquo;misalignment&rdquo; of the pattern during the masking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> are conceptual diagrams given for explaining such &ldquo;misalignment&rdquo; in patterning. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> illustrates a case where the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is deviated from a right location relative to the gate trench. When the &ldquo;misalignment&rdquo; in the patterning is caused in such a way, a width of the MOS channel is reduced, and consequently, the ON-resistance rises. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, in case of &ldquo;misalignment&rdquo;, a margin for pattern alignment (a flat portion of the source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is provided so as to avoid a reduction of the channel width. However, there still arises another problem that an increased width w of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for the margin causes an increase m base resistant R<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>right below the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and this also increases likeliness to raise a potential at the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which eventually decreases a durability against latch-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As will be recognized, this embodiment provides a manufacturing method that is effective in minimizing the width w of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to enhance the durability against latch-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view showing a manufacturing method of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Specifically, in this embodiment, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A, a</cross-reference> trench T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is first tunneled down to a depth at which the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is to be formed, and thereafter, the n-type impurities are introduced into side walls of the trench T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by means of implantation at slant angle, vapor diffusion, solid state diffusion, or the like. After that, the impurities are activated under thermal control to produce the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a self-alignment manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Then, the manufacturing process illustrated in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> may be used to produce the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to this embodiment, since the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be produced in a self-alignment manner relative to the trenches, there is no need of providing a margin to avoid &ldquo;misalignment&rdquo;. As a consequence, the width w of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be reduced, and the resultant enhancement of the durability against latch-up leads to a reduction of saturation current, which eventually brings about an improved IGBT having a considerably enhanced durability against short-circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the instant embodiment, since impurities are implanted into the side walls of the trenches to produce the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an impurity concentration of the n-type region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be uniform at any point along depths of the trenches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating a distribution of impurity concentration along the depths of the trenches T in the IGBT manufactured according to this embodiment. A lateral axis of the graph represents a distance from an opening level of the tops of the trenches T in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> down to deeper portions thereof along the side walls while a vertical axis of the graph represents an impurity concentration. In this graph, Nb, Pch, and Ns respectively denote concentration distributions of n-type impurities in the n-type base layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, p-type impurities in the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and n-type impurities in the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, the resultant uniform distribution of the impurity concentration in the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> facilitates an operation voltage design in the device, and this allows a device of desired properties to be manufactured in a stable and ensured manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> (Fifth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Another exemplary method of manufacturing the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A through 10D</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views showing such a manufacturing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, the p-type channel layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is first produced. A means for the production is the same as those mentioned above in the Second and Third Embodiments (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Next, as can be seen <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, the gate structure is created. For instance, the gate insulation film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is created inner walls of the trenches T, and the trenches are embedded with the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> After that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>C, the gate insulation film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is removed from the vicinity of the wafer surface, and an insulator layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> containing the n-type impurities (e.g., PSG film) is created at the tops of the trenches to bury the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The n-type impurities in the insulator layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is diffused (solid phase diffusion) to produce the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, also, the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be produced in a self-alignment manner relative to the trenches, and hence, there is no need of providing a margin to avoid &ldquo;misalignment&rdquo;. As a consequence, the width w of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be reduced, and the resultant enhancement of the durability against latch-up leads to a reduction of saturation current, which eventually brings about an improved IGBT having a considerably enhanced durability against short-circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, this embodiment ensures and facilitates a control of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extending downward along the depths of the trenches, and a prospective margin during the manufacturing process becomes wider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> (Sixth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Further another exemplary method of manufacturing the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views illustrating such a manufacturing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, first, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, the trenches are formed and embedded with the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This and preceding stages are the same as those in the Fifth Embodiment, except that the mask insulation film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is not peeled off at this time of the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, parts of the gate insulation film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which extend above the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, are peeled off, and thereafter, the n-type impurities are introduced by means of implantation at slant angle, vapor diffusion, solid state diffusion, or the like. After that, the impurities are activated under thermal control to produce the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, also, since the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be created in a self-alignment manner relative to the trenches, there is no need of providing a margin to avoid &ldquo;misalignment&rdquo;. As a consequence, the width w of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be reduced, and the resultant enhancement of the durability against latch-up leads to a reduction of saturation current, which eventually brings about an improved IGBT having a considerably enhanced durability against short-circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Moreover, this embodiment ensures and facilitates a control of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extending downward along the depths of the trenches, as well, and a prospective margin during the manufacturing process becomes wider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> (Seventh Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Another exemplary method of manufacturing the emitter electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will now be described. In aforementioned Embodiments 4 to 6, the impurities are introduced into the side <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> walls of the trenches to produce the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and thus, the advantageous methods of manufacturing devices having enhanced durability against latch-up are provided. In conformity with them, this embodiment provides an improved manufacturing method where the emitter electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is also connected to the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the side walls of the trenches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> If the width w of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is reduced by any of the manufacturing methods described and depicted in Fourth through Sixth Embodiments and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B, the durability against latch-up is enhanced but a direct connection of the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the emitter electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> becomes difficult. Therefore, a &ldquo;lattice&rdquo; pattern as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> may be required. However, if a connection at the side walls of the trench is implemented, the &ldquo;lattice&rdquo; pattern is not required, and this further results in a reduction of a basic cell width in the device as well as an enhancement of a device property (with regard to ON-resistance). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views showing the method of forming the emitter electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, the trenches T are formed and embedded with the gate insulation film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, after the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are partially eliminated to have their respective tops leveled down below the surface of the substrate, an interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed. The gate insulation film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> extending upward beyond the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is peeled off, and the surface of the substrate is filled and covered with the emitter electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the emitter electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can connect to the P-type base layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> while being in contact with the n-type source layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the side walls of the trenches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the &ldquo;lattice&rdquo; pattern as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is unnecessary. Consequently, the cell width of the device can be reduced while a MOS channel width per unit area is increased, so as to reduce the ON-resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the invention have been described by way of example, and it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to these examples. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As has been described in details, in accordance with any embodiment of the invention, providing the channel layers adjacent to the side walls of the trenches permits the device of the trench MOS structure to have a reduced saturation current without an increase in the ON-resistance, thereby attaining an enhanced durability against short-circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Additionally, according to any embodiment of the present invention, the n-type source layer is formed in a self-alignment manner, and the emitter electrode is connected to the n-type source layer at the side walls of the trenches, whereby the basic cell structure of the device can be reduced, and the ON-resistance also can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Thus, the embodiments of the present invention ensure and facilitate production of the high performance semiconductor device having trench gates, and it offers a large amount of benefit in this point to the industry. </paragraph>
