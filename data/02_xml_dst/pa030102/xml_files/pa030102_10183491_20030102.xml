<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A transmitter is disclosed. The transmitter has an RF portion having an amplifier for amplifying a signal for transmission. The RF portion is fed by a baseband portion. The baseband portion comprises: means for generating a pair of in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) data signals; and a limiter arrangement for preventing the amplitude of both the I and Q data signals exceeding a predetermined level. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a transmitter for use in a radio system operable according to a non-constant envelope modulation scheme&mdash;particularly the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) standard. It finds particular, but not exclusive utility in a radio system employing both Time Division Duplex (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD). However, it also provides benefits in a system employing only one of these, or other, technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> WCDMA technology is being used to provide access to third generation (3G) mobile telecommunication systems. Two particular variants of WCDMA are TDD and FDD. FDD is intended to be used for macrocellular applications, and splits the transmit and receive bands into two distinct frequency spectra. A possible application for TDD is in micro- and pico-cellular applications. TDD splits the transmit and receive channels on a timeslot basis&mdash;each residing on the same physical channel. TDD is better suited to applications requiring different bandwidths in the uplink and downlink directions, as the amount of bandwidth allocated in each direction can be dynamically varied. In this way, a user who is web browsing, for instance, can have more timeslots allocated to the downlink, as he is receiving more data than he is sending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The standards and regulations governing devices operating according to WCDMA specify certain key parameter ranges within which all compliant devices must operate. One key signal quality metric is Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR). This metric gives a measure of the interference experienced on a channel adjacent to that currently being used for transmission. A primary cause of poor ACLR performance is operation of the transmitter&apos;s power amplifier (PA) in a non-linear region. Use of a PA having an insufficient dynamic range can result in the output signal from the PA being compressed. Such compression will spread the output spectrum of the PA. This spreading can leak through into adjacent channels, resulting in poor ACLR performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Prior art PAs address this problem by specifying the PA to operate in a linear region for all output powers of the PA. Achieving linear performance from PAs requires them to be operated in an inefficient manner i.e. the ratio of RF Power out, to DC power in to the PA, is poor. This arrangement, which has thus far been required in order to comply with the operating standards, has resulted in PAs which require high currents from the device power supply. For mobile devices, this consequently leads to poor battery life, which has an impact on talk time. In the case of base stations, the operating costs associated with inefficient power supplies can be sizeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> WCDMA signals typically have high a peak to average ratio (PAR). This means that the peak signal from the PA can sometimes be several dB higher than the average signal. In prior art transmitters, the PA must be operable in a linear fashion across this entire range. This results in inefficiencies as described previously. The highest value of PAR experienced in a system is defined as the &lsquo;crest factor&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to reduce the crest factor, and thus the difference between the peak and the average output power from the PA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a transmitter comprising an RF portion having an amplifier for amplifying a signal for transmission, the RF portion being fed by a baseband portion, wherein the baseband portion comprises: means for generating a pair of in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) data signals; and a limiter arrangement for preventing the amplitude of both the I and Q data signals exceeding a predetermined level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention act to reduce the crest factor associated with non-constant envelope modulation schemes. Particular embodiments are described relating to WCDMA systems, but the principles can be applied equally to other relevant communication standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Compression of the signal from the PA of a transmitter can cause spurs to appear in the output spectrum. Embodiments of the invention seek to address this problem by deliberately clipping the data signals in the baseband portion of the transmitter. Such clipping has the effect of reducing the dynamic range over which the PA must operate. This allows the PA to be specified to operate in a more linear region, and so reduces the likelihood of compression affecting the transmitted signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As described previously, there are two particular variants of WCDMA: FDD and TDD. TDD uses QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), and has a particular crest factor. FDD uses a slightly different modulation scheme known as HPSK (Hybrid Phase Shift Keying) on the uplink signals. This has an associated different crest factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, it is expected that dual-mode TDD/FDD handsets and base stations will be available, and in a desire to minimise component count, a common PA will be used, which must be operable under worst-case condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The clipping can be carried out on the I and Q data signals directly. A suitable means for performing this operation is a limiter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the I and Q data signals may be converted for clipping purposes. A preferred embodiment converts the I and Q data signals into corresponding polar co-ordinates. In this way, the magnitude signal may be limited, recombined with the phase signal, and converted back into I and Q data signals for onward processing. Preferably, the baseband portion of the transmitter is implemented using ASIC technology, preferably using a single device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The problem of transmitter inefficiency addressed by embodiments of the invention is experienced in both handsets and base stations. In handsets, the inefficiency leads to shorter than desirable talk times. In base stations, the inefficiency leads to higher running costs. As such, embodiments of the invention may be usefully employed in either setting.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A prior art WCDMA transmitter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This is well known to the skilled man, but for the sake of completeness, a brief summary is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The input to the system DPCH <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. DPCH is an acronym for Dedicated Physical Channel, and its constituents are different depending on whether FDD or TDD is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> DPCH <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is fed into the WCDMA spreading function <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, where it is encoded to yield digital I <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and Q <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> output signals. These are next fed into digital Root Raised Cosine (RRC) filters <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for pulse shaping. The outputs of these filters are fed into Digital to Analogue Converters (DACs) <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for conversion into analogue signals suitable for transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The outputs from the DACs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are next fed into analogue reconstruction filters <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which smooth the outputs of the DACs in preparation for mixing to the transmission frequency in mixers <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. One of the mixers <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is also fed with a carrier signal from synthesiser <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The other mixer <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is fed with a 90&deg; phase shifted version of the carrier signal from phase shifter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The outputs from the two mixers <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are fed into a summer <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to combine the signals. The output from summer <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is fed into the PA <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and is fed into an antenna, possibly via one or more filters. The PA <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> may be preceded by a transmit pre-amplifier (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The digital portion of the transmitter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is commonly referred to as the baseband portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As described previously, the PA is configured to avoid compressing the output signal, as this seriously degrades the ACLR performance metric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a typical signal trajectory corresponding to a transmission from the transmitter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The signal trajectory <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is shown in customary fashion on I-Q axes. The dotted circle <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> represents the average power transmitted by the PA <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> over a prolonged period. The crest factor may be represented by the furthest distance between the signal trajectory outside the circle and the circle. In this instance, the arrow <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> indicates the peak power above the average power. This power which is required above the average leads to the PA being run in an inefficient mode as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of the invention comprising an additional functional module <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in the baseband portion of the transmitter <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The like numbered components of transmitters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Module <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to comprise three functional parts. The two inputs to module <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are I and Q data signals. Module <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is a rectangular to polar co-ordinate translator. It takes the I &amp; Q data signals and converts them into two data signals representing amplitude and phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The amplitude signal is input to module <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Module <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> acts as a limiter according to a single rule. The rule is that if the input signal exceeds a certain threshold then the output equals that threshold, else the output is identical to the input. In this way, the signal from module <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> never exceeds the threshold, but if the input is lower than the threshold, it passes through intact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The clipped amplitude data output from module <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is combined with the untouched phase data from module <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in module <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Module <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> converts the clipped amplitude and phase data into rectangular, i.e. I &amp; Q, co-ordinates for applying to DACs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The effect that this has on the output trajectory is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In contrast to the output trajectory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it can be seen clearly that the trajectory <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is clipped so as to never exceed a threshold as defined by the dotted circle <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Circle <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> illustrates the average power transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> This reduction in peak output power has the effect of lowering the crest factor, which means that the PA can be operated in a more efficient manner as described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of the invention carries out the baseband clipping task without first converting the transmit signals into polar form. Digital signal processors are better suited to performing mathematical threshold functions, as compared to mathematical functions used to convert between rectangular and polar co-ordinates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an ideal constellation diagram for a QPSK system. The important points are, of course, the points <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> lying on the respective I and Q axes. The ideal output trajectory lies inside the circle <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. However, due to non-idealities in the transmit chain, the output trajectory can stray outside the ideal circle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Rather that convert the I/Q data into polar data for clipping purposes, an alternative technique can clip the I and Q signals directly. The limits of such a clipper/limiter are as shown by the dotted square <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Any I signal exceeding the limit defined by the right or left hand side of the square are limited to the threshold level. Likewise for any Q signal exceeding the upper or lower side of the square. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In this way, the I and Q signals, present in any case in the transmitter, can be clipped directly, without requiring conversion to polar co-ordinates first. The net effect is the same, in that the baseband clipping introduced directly lowers the crest factor of the transmitted signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An alternative spreading scheme places the constellation points as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In this case, it is not simply a matter of limiting the I and Q signals directly, as they are offset from the axes by 45&deg;. It is necessary to rotate the signals by 45&deg;, i.e. apply a phase shift, before the signals are limited as before. Depending on the system in use, it may or may not be necessary to rotate the signals back to their original positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows the effect of applying a phase shift of 45&deg; to the I and Q signals. The constellation points have been shifted to the axes, and the clipping limit is again illustrated by dotted square <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. The situation now resembles the situation previously described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A suitable arrangement for providing the necessary phase shift is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. WCDMA spreading is performed in module <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to yield digital I and Q signals. In order to phase shift these by 45&deg;, it is necessary to mix them with a signal having the requisite phase characteristics. This signal is produced by multiplying the I and Q signals, in multipliers <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, with a signal from module <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The result of the multiplication process is to shift the constellation points round by 45&deg;, thus placing them on the axes of the constellation diagram as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The limiters <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> act to pass any signal below a certain defined threshold, and to clip any signal exceeding that threshold. The resultant signals can then be fed into the remainder of the transmit chain as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> from DACs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> onwards, or alternatively, the signals can be phase shifted back to their original positions by mixing with a signal from module <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> giving a phase shift of &minus;45&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The same principle can be adopted for signals having more than 4 constellation points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> There is a compromise to be struck in opting to clip the signals in the baseband. The output signal is altered compared to that previously obtained from a WCDMA transmitter. The effect of this is to degrade the ACLR performance, and the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) performance. EVM gives a measure of the error rate of the transmitter, in terms of mean distance of a transmission from the ideal constellation points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Provided that the clipping which is introduced degrades the ACLR without taking the transmitter out of the acceptable range for EVM performance, then some degree of baseband clipping is acceptable. The exact amount of clipping which can be introduced is dependent on the exact specification with which the transmitter is operating, and may be determined empirically or with simulations in each case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a graph of the typical reduction in crest factor which may be achieved through the use of baseband clipping at various levels. As can be seen, introducing baseband clipping of 3 db can reduce the crest factor by 2 dB. This scale of reduction in crest factor can allow significant improvements in the efficiency of the PA, resulting in improved talk times from a given battery in a hand-held device, and lower running costs for a base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the impact on ACLR from various levels of reduction in the crest factor. Curve <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> shows the ACLR figure for a channel 5 MHz from the transmit channel. Curve <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> shows the ACLR figure for a channel 10 MHz from the transmit channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a graph of the effect on EVM performance with a reduction in crest factor. It can be seen that as the crest factor is reduced by baseband clipping, the EVM performance is degraded. Note, however, that the degradation does not become significant until the crest factor has been reduced by approximately 1.5 dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Working from the graphs of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the necessary compromise can be struck between acceptable levels of ACLR and EVM performance achievable from a given level of Baseband clipping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Although described in terms of the WCDMA communication protocol, the skilled man will realise that the benefits afforded by embodiments of the invention may be realised by any modulation scheme producing a nonconstant envelope signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes any novel feature or combination of features disclosed herein either explicitly or any generalisation thereof irrespective of whether or not it relates to the claimed invention or mitigates any or all of the problems addressed. </paragraph>
