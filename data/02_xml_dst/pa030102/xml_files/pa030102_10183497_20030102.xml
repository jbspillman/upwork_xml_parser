<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to methods for manufacturing multilayer ceramic substrates, and more particularly, relates to a method for manufacturing a plurality of multilayer ceramic substrates, which comprises a step of forming a multilayer mother substrate and a subsequent step of dividing the multilayer mother substrate so as to obtain the plurality of multilayer ceramic substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Multilayer substrates are formed of a plurality of ceramic layers laminated to each other. The multilayer ceramic substrates are provided with various types of wiring conductors. As the wiring conductors, for example, internal conductive films extending along predetermined interfaces between ceramic layers or via hole conductors penetrating through predetermined ceramic layers may be formed inside the multilayer ceramic substrates, and external conductive films extending on the external surfaces of the multilayer ceramic substrates may also be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The multilayer ceramic substrate is used for mounting semiconductor chip elements and other chip elements thereon and is also used for connecting these electronic elements to each other. The wiring conductors are used as electrical paths for forming interconnection among these elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In addition, passive elements such as a capacitor element or an inductor element may be formed inside the multilayer ceramic substrate in some cases. These passive elements may be formed of parts of the internal conductive films or the via hole conductors described above. The multilayer ceramic substrates are used as, for example, LCR hybrid high-frequency devices in the field of mobile communication terminal apparatuses; composite devices formed of active elements, such as a semiconductor IC chip, and passive elements, such as a capacitor, an inductor or a resistor, in the field of computers; or simple semiconductor IC packages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In particular, the multilayer ceramic substrates have been widely used for forming various electronic devices, such as power amplifier (PA) module substrates, radio-frequency (RF) diode switches, filters, chip antennas, various package devices and hydride devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to form a multilayer ceramic substrate having enhanced multifunctionality, higher integration density and improved performance, it is effective that the wiring conductors be densely formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Since a firing step must be performed in order to obtain the multilayer ceramic substrate, the shrinkage of the ceramic caused by firing occurs in three directions X, Y, and Z. The shrinkage is likely to occur nonuniformly in the entire multilayer ceramic substrate, and the dimensions between the X direction and the Y direction may become different by approximately 0.4% to 0.6%. As a result, warping of the multilayer ceramic substrate occurs. Consequently, the positional accuracy of external conductive films may be degraded, and in addition, undesired deformations, strains or disconnections of internal wiring conductors may also occur in some cases. These defects in the wiring conductors interfere with the trend towards higher wiring density of conductors described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a so-called non-shrinkage process has been proposed in which the firing shrinkage in the direction parallel to the main surface can be substantially prevented in when a multilayer ceramic substrate is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a method for manufacturing a multilayer ceramic substrate by the non-shrinkage process, a low-temperature sinterable ceramic powder which is sinterable at a temperature of, for example, 1,000&deg; C. or less is prepared as an insulating ceramic material, and in addition, an inorganic powder which functions to suppress the shrinkage and which is not sintered at the sintering temperature of the low-temperature sinterable ceramic powder is also prepared. When a green laminate which will be fired to form the desired multilayer ceramic substrate is produced, shrinkage suppression layers containing the non-sinterable ceramic are disposed so as to sandwich a plurality of ceramic green sheets which are laminated to each other and which contain the low-temperature sinterable ceramic material, and on which the ceramic green sheets, wiring conductors are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The green laminate thus formed is then fired. During this firing step, reaction layers approximately 2 to 3 &mgr;m thick are formed at the interface portions between the ceramic green layers and the shrinkage suppression layers, and each reaction layer serves to adhere the ceramic green sheet and the shrinkage suppression layer to each other. In addition, the shrinkage does not substantially occur in the shrinkage suppression layer since the inorganic powder contained in the shrinkage suppression layer is not substantially sintered. Accordingly, the shrinkage suppression layers restrain the ceramic green layers from shrinking, and hence, the ceramic green layers substantially shrink only in the Z direction, that is, the thickness direction, but are restrained from shrinking in the X and the Y directions, that is, the direction parallel to the main surface. As a result, the multilayer ceramic substrate described above obtained by firing the green laminate is not susceptible to nonuniform deformation, the warpage thereof is decreased, the defects of the wiring conductors described above are unlikely to occur, and hence, higher wiring density of the conductors can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The shrinkage suppression layers described above are removed after firing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When a multilayer ceramic substrate is produced, a so-called multiple formation method is used in order to increase the production efficiency and comprises a step of forming a multilayer mother substrate which includes a plurality of multilayer ceramic substrates and a step of dividing this multilayer mother substrate along predetermined dividing lines so as to obtain the plurality of multilayer ceramic substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In order to efficiently divide a multilayer mother substrate in the multiple formation method, the multilayer mother substrate preferably has cut-in grooves along predetermined dividing lines. In the case in which the cut-in grooves are provided in accordance with a so-called chocolate break configuration, the multilayer mother substrate may be divided along the predetermined dividing lines when simply bent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the multiple formation method, the shrinkage in a firing step is also likely to occur nonuniformly in the whole multilayer mother substrate, the dimensions between the X direction and the Y direction may become different from each other, and warping of the multilayer mother substrate may occur in some cases. Accordingly, the non-shrinkage process described above is preferably used in the multiple formation methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In Japanese Patent No. 2856045, a green composite laminate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided with cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disclosed, the green composite laminate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprising first and second shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a green (i.e., an unfired state) multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> provided therebetween, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> hereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Wiring conductors provided for the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, and the dimension in the thickness direction thereof is exaggeratedly in the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> containing an insulating ceramic powder such as a low-temperature sinterable ceramic powder, and these ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are formed of a plurality of ceramic green sheets laminated to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> contain an inorganic powder that is not sintered at the sintering temperature of the insulating ceramic powder of layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The first and the second shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are each formed of, for example, a predetermined number of inorganic material green sheets <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which contain an inorganic material and which are laminated to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In order to form the green composite laminate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is first formed. Next, cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are formed in at least one of the major surface sides the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When the cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are formed, the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is compressed in the lamination direction of the formed cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in order to avoid displacement that may occur among the plurality of ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Next, the first and the second shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are formed by laminating the inorganic material green sheets <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so as to sandwich the green mother substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and as a result, the green composite laminate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed. Subsequently, the whole green composite laminate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is again compressed in the lamination direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Next, the green composite laminate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fired under the conditions in which the insulating ceramic powder contained in the ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is sintered and the inorganic powder contained in the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is not sintered. Accordingly, the sintered multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> provided between the first and the second shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is obtained. Subsequently, the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are removed, and hence, the sintered multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, the sintered multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is divided along the cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and hence, the plurality of multilayer ceramic substrates is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In addition, a green composite laminate comprising shrinkage suppression layers and a green multilayer mother substrate provided therebetween is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2000-176928. In this publication, a process is described in which cut-in grooves are provided in the green composite laminate at the two major surfaces sides, the shrinkage suppression layers are further formed so as to cover the cut-in grooves, the laminate thus formed is fired, the shrinkage suppression layers are then removed so as to obtain the sintered multilayer mother substrate, and this multilayer mother substrate is then divided along the cut-in grooves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> However, since the step of forming the cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is different from the previously described in the Unexamined Patent Application Publication step, must be performed in the course of laminating steps for forming the green composite laminate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> according to the method disclosed in Patent No. 2856045, the laminating steps and the cut-in groove forming step cannot be efficiently performed, and as a result, the productivity of the multilayer ceramic substrate is decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, since the cut-in grooves are formed in the green composite laminate at the two major surface sides according to the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2000-176928, and the sintered multilayer mother substrate still has the cut-in grooves at the two major surfaces sides, the division of the sintered multilayer mother substrate can be smoothly performed for forming the plurality of multilayer ceramic substrates. However, since the shrinkage suppression layers must be further formed so as to over the cut-in grooves provided in the green composite laminate at the two major surface sides, the process becomes complicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In addition, a method for forming external terminal electrodes on side surfaces of the multilayer ceramic substrate has not been described at all in the two publications described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Concomitant with the trends towards higher wiring density and miniaturization of multilayer ceramic substrates, it has been strongly desired in recent years that the positions and the dimensions, such as the widths, of the external terminal electrodes be formed with high accuracy. The reason for this is that when the accuracy is degraded and a plurality of external terminal electrodes are provided, short-circuiting may occur between adjacent external terminal electrodes, or electrical connections of a mother board to multilayer ceramic substrates mounted thereon may not be properly obtained in some cases. In particular, when a plurality of external terminal electrodes is plated, and the plating films are abnormally deposited, the problem of short-circuiting between the adjacent external terminal electrodes becomes more serious. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing multilayer ceramic substrates which can solve the problems described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing multilayer ceramic substrates in accordance with a multiple formation method using a non-shrinkage process. Briefly speaking, the method is characterized in that a sintered multilayer mother substrate is easily divided by providing through-holes at least in a green multilayer mother substrate forming a green composite laminate, and that when necessary, the positions and the dimensions of external terminal electrodes can be formed with high accuracy by using the inside surfaces of the through-holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for forming multilayer ceramic substrates each including ceramic layers laminated to each other, and the method comprises the following steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A green composite laminate is first formed which comprises a green multilayer mother substrate including ceramic green layers which contain an insulating ceramic powder and which are formed into the ceramic layers by firing, the green multilayer mother substrate being formed to be divided along predetermined dividing lines after the firing so as to obtain the multilayer ceramic substrates; shrinkage suppression layers which contain an inorganic powder and which are disposed so as to sandwich the green multilayer mother substrate in the lamination direction, the inorganic powder not being sintered at the sintering temperature of the insulating ceramic powder; and through-holes provided on the dividing lines so as to penetrate at least the green multilayer mother substrate in the lamination direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Next, the green composite laminate described above is fired under the conditions in which the insulating ceramic powder is sintered and the inorganic powder is not sintered. As a result, a sintered multilayer mother substrate between the shrinkage suppression layers is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Next, the shrinkage suppression layers are removed. As a result, the sintered multilayer mother substrate is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the fired multilayer mother substrate is divided along the dividing lines. As a result, the multilayer ceramic substrates each have side surfaces including moieties of the inside surfaces of the through-holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The step of forming the green composite laminate may comprise a substep of preparing ceramic green sheets for forming the ceramic green layers; a substep of preparing inorganic green sheets for forming the shrinkage suppression layers; a substep of laminating the ceramic green sheets to each other; and a substep of laminating the inorganic green sheets so as to sandwich the ceramic green sheets in the lamination direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the method described above, the step of forming the green composite laminate may further comprise a substep of forming a penetrating portion in a predetermined ceramic green sheet of the ceramic green sheets to form a cavity in each of the multilayer ceramic substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In addition, the step of forming the green composite laminate in order to form the through-holes described above may further comprise a substep of forming the through-holes in the green multilayer mother substrate which is provided between the shrinkage suppression layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When the green composite laminate is formed, as described above, and when the substep of laminating the ceramic green sheets and the substep of laminating the inorganic green sheets are used, apertures may be provided in the ceramic green sheets so as to form the through-holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the following method is preferably used when the external terminal electrodes are formed using the through-holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The step of forming the green composite laminate may further comprises a substep of providing conductors for forming the external terminal electrodes of the multilayer ceramic substrates so that the conductors are exposed at the inside surfaces of the through-holes. Accordingly, the conductors after the step of dividing the sintered multilayer mother substrate to form the multilayer ceramic substrates are exposed at parts of the side surfaces of the multilayer ceramic substrates, the parts of the side surfaces corresponding to parts of the inside surfaces of the through-holes, so as to form the external terminal electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the step of forming the green composite laminate described above, the through-holes are preferably provided so as to divide the conductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The conductors may be provided so as to penetrate the green multilayer mother substrate in the lamination direction or may be provided so as to extend to a part of the green multilayer structure in the lamination direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, wet plating such as electroless plating may be performed for the conductors, which are formed into the external terminal electrodes, before the multilayer mother substrate is divided. That is, after the shrinkage suppression layers are removed and before the multilayer mother substrate is divided, plating films may be deposited on the surfaces of the conductors which are exposed at the inside surfaces of the through-holes when wet plating is performed for the sintered multilayer mother substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to form the external terminal electrodes, conductors may be formed on parts of the side surfaces of the multilayer ceramic substrates which are formed in the step of dividing the multilayer mother substrate following the firing step, in which the parts of the side surfaces correspond to parts of the inside surfaces of the through-holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The conductors, which are formed into the external terminal electrodes, preferably comprise a conductive paste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is preferable that the conductors be primarily composed of at least one member of the group of Ag, an Ag&mdash;Pt alloy, an Ag&mdash;Pd alloy, Cu, Au, and Ni. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The through-holes may have an optional cross-section shape in the present invention; however, in order to easily and efficiently divide the multilayer mother substrate, it is preferable that the through-holes have rectangular cross-sectional shapes, and that the longer sides thereof be provided in the directions in which the dividing lines extend. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In order to easily divide the multilayer mother substrate for forming the multilayer ceramic substrates, cut-in grooves may be generally formed along the dividing lines. In the present invention, when the cut-in grooves are formed, the following steps may be performed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are views for illustrating a first embodiment of the present invention. In these figures, FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> show various steps of a process for manufacturing multilayer ceramic substrates. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are plan views showing a composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 5</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are enlarged cross-sectional views of a part of the composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In addition, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a plan view of a multilayer ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> obtained through the steps shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 5</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, as in the case described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the dimension in the thickness direction is exaggeratedly shown, and wiring conductors are not shown in the figures except for conductors for forming external terminal electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the multilayer ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is obtained from the composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, comprises a plurality of ceramic layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (only the topmost layer is shown in this figure) laminated to each other. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the green composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a green multilayer substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> composed of a plurality of ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which contain an insulating ceramic powder and which are formed into the plurality of ceramic layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> described above by firing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The laminated structure composed of the ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed by, for example, laminating ceramic green sheets, and the ceramic green sheets are obtained by the steps of, for example, adding a binder, a plasticizer, a solvent and the like to an insulating ceramic powder, mixing this mixture using a ball mill or the like to form a slurry, and processing this slurry by a doctor blade method or the like to form sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As the insulating ceramic powder described above, an insulating ceramic powder generally used for forming conventional multilayer ceramic substrates may be used. For example, powdered alumina may be used, and an amorphous glass having a softening point of about 600 to 800&deg; C., a crystallized glass having a crystallization temperature of about 600 to 1,000&deg; C., or the like, may be contained in the powdered alumina. In addition to alumina, zircon, mullite, cordierite, anorthite, or silica may also be used as the insulating ceramic powder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As the binder, for example, poly(vinyl butyral), methacrylate polymer or acrylic polymer may be used, and as the plasticizer, phthalic acid derivatives or the like may be used. In addition, as the solvent, for example, alcohols, ketones, or chlorinated organic solvents may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> After being cut into a predetermined size, the ceramic green sheets are laminated to each other, thereby forming the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> comprising the ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> laminated to each other. The thickness of the ceramic green sheet is not specifically limited; however, in general, a thickness of approximately 25 to 200 &mgr;m is preferable. The green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed to be divided after firing along predetermined dividing lines <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provided in a lattice pattern so that a plurality of the multilayer ceramic substrates <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which will be formed into external terminal electrodes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) of the multilayer ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are disposed inside the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in detail, the conductor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a rectangular shape in cross-section and is disposed so as to intersect the dividing line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in detail, the conductor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed so as to penetrate the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the lamination direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The conductor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is preferably formed of a conductive paste. In order to form the conductor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the ceramic green sheets for forming the ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are provided with apertures therein before being laminated to each other, and subsequently, the apertures are filled with a conductive paste. Alternatively, after the green mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having the laminated structure is formed and apertures penetrating therethrough are formed, these apertures may be filled with a conductive paste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Even though not shown in the figure, when necessary, conductive films for forming wiring conductors may be formed on the ceramic green sheets, which are not laminated to each other, by screen printing or the like using a conductive paste, apertures may be formed for via hole conductors, and a conductive paste may be filled in the apertures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the conductor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the conductive film for forming the wiring conductor, and the via hole conductor be primarily composed of at least one selected from the group consisting of Ag, an Ag&mdash;Pt alloy, an Ag&mdash;Pd alloy, Cu, Au and Ni. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In addition, first and the second shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided in the green composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to sandwich the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the lamination direction. These shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> contain an inorganic powder which is not sintered at a sintering temperature of the insulating ceramic powder contained in the ceramic green sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> For example, when a powder having a sintering temperature of about 1,100&deg; C. or less is used, as the inorganic powder contained in the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, for example, alumina, zirconium oxide, aluminum nitride, boron nitride, mullite, magnesium oxide, silicon carbide, or the like may be used as the insulating ceramic powder contained in the ceramic green sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the particle size of these inorganic powders are too coarse, the surface roughness of the obtained multilayer ceramic substrate also becomes coarse, and hence, the average particle diameter is preferably in the range of approximately about 0.5 to 4 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed by laminating inorganic green sheets <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> containing the inorganic powder. The method for forming the inorganic green sheet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is substantially equivalent to that for the ceramic green sheet for forming the ceramic green layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In addition, the thickness of the inorganic green sheet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is not specifically limited; however, a thickness of approximately 10 to 200 &mgr;m is preferable. The individual thicknesses of the first and the second shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be controlled by the number of inorganic green sheets <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which are laminated to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As described above, the green composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprising the first and the second shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provided therebetween in the lamination direction is formed, and subsequently, the whole green composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is compressed in the lamination direction. This compression is performed not only for preventing displacement which occurs between the ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in subsequent steps but also for improving the adhesion between the ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> forming the multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, between the inorganic green sheets <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> forming the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and between the multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the compressing is performed, a relatively high pressure such as 50 MPa or more is applied. In addition, the compressing is preferably performed at a temperature of about 40 to 90&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, a plurality of through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> penetrating at least the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the lamination direction in the green composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided on the dividing lines <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In addition to the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are also provided with the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> penetrating therethrough in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have, for example, a circular shape in a cross-section and are formed at positions to penetrate the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are exposed at the inside surfaces of the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In addition, in this embodiment, by forming the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are divided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> When the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed, apertures may be formed beforehand in ceramic green sheets for forming the ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to form the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this case, the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed to penetrate only the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In addition, the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be formed in a green composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which does not comprise one of the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, that is, in the green multilayer mother laminate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is provided with one of the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and subsequently, the remaining shrinkage suppression layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be disposed on the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are provided along the dividing lines <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the green laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. These cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are disposed in a lattice pattern as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> in detail. As a method for forming the cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, for example, a method for pressing a cutter blade onto a surface of the composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or a method for cutting in the composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a rotary blade may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are formed so as to penetrate the first shrinkage suppression layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and to extend into a part of the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to a certain depth in the lamination direction. This depth is approximately one-tenth to four-tenths of the thickness of the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may also be provided at the second shrinkage suppression layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> side so as to correspond to the positions of the cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at the first shrinkage suppression layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Next, the green composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provided with the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is processed in a firing step. This firing step is performed under the conditions in which only the insulating ceramic powder contained in the ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are sintered and the inorganic powder contained in the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not sintered. When the composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is placed on a tray while being fired, a tray made of a general alumina plate may be used. In addition, a tray made of an alumina plate having a high porosity and superior permeability may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Since the inorganic powder contained in the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not substantially sintered in the firing step, the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> do not substantially shrink. Accordingly, the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> restrict the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and as a result, the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> substantially shrinks only in the thickness direction and is restricted from being shrunk in the direction parallel to the main surface. Consequently, nonuniform deformation of the multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> after firing is unlikely to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> After the fired multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provided between the first and the second shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is obtained, the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are removed by using a brush or the like, and as a result, the fired multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Next, wet plating such as electroless plating is performed for the fired multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, that is, a step of depositing plating films on exposed surfaces of the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provided in the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is performed. More particularly, nickel plating films or the like are formed on the surfaces of the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by electroless plating, and on the films thus formed, gold plating films are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the fired multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is divided along the cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and as a result, the desired multilayer ceramic substrates <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> At side surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the multilayer ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which correspond to parts of the inside surfaces of the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are exposed to the outside so as to form external terminal electrodes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described heretofore with reference to the first embodiment; however, without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention, various modifications may be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> For example, the cut-in groove <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has a V-shaped cross-section in the first embodiment; however, another shape such as a U-shape cross-section may also be used, and in addition, as long as the fired composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> does not easily crack when handled, a cut-in groove having any other shape may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In addition, the composite laminate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has substantially a square shape in plan view; however, a rectangular shape in plan view, in which the sides intersecting each other have lengths different from each other, may also be used. </paragraph>

In addition, the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in this embodiment are formed at intersections of dividing lines <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, that is, at intersections between cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, extending in the longitudinal direction and in the lateral direction. Accordingly, when the multilayer ceramic substrates are obtained by dividing the fired multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, external terminal electrodes are formed at four corners of each multilayer ceramic substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Even though not shown in the figures, various types of conductor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having cross-sections different from each other and/or various types of through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having cross-sections different from each other may be formed in one composite laminate or one multilayer mother substrate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference> are views for illustrating a sixth embodiment of the present invention and correspond to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> in the first embodiment, respectively. The same reference numerals of the constituent elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> designate the same constituent elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, and descriptions thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> This sixth embodiment is characterized in that multilayer ceramic substrates each having a cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are formed. In order to form the cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a penetrating portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for forming the cavity are formed in predetermined ceramic green sheets selected from the ceramic green sheets for forming the ceramic green layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which constitute the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In addition, the first shrinkage suppression layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> provided at an opening side of the cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with a penetrating portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which communicate with the cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The reason for this is that in a compression step, compression can be easily performed for the bottom portion of the cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> When the cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is formed, the fired multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may easily and undesirably crack at the cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> portions in some cases. Accordingly, relatively deep cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for dividing the multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are preferably formed so as to form the multilayer ceramic substrates. The depth of the cut-in groove <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be approximately seven-tenths of the thickness of the multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in some cases. </paragraph>

The same reference numerals of the constituent elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> designate the same constituent elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, and descriptions thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and so on, the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are disposed so as to penetrate the green mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the lamination direction; however, in the seventh embodiment, conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are each disposed to extend only to a part of the green multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the lamination direction. When multilayer ceramic substrates in this embodiment are mounted on a motherboard, in addition to a decrease of solder amount, the heights of solder fillets which will be formed can be decreased and can be easily made constant. Accordingly, when this multilayer ceramic substrate is used in high-frequency applications, variation in inductance component caused by solder fillets can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and is a view for illustrating an eighth embodiment of the present invention. The same reference numerals of the constituent elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> designate the same constituent elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, and descriptions thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In this eighth embodiment, conductors for forming the external terminal electrodes are not provided in the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Even when the conductors are not provided, the presence of the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may at least fulfill the effect of smoothly dividing the sintered multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> along the dividing lines <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, when the external terminal electrodes are necessary, a conductive paste or the like may be applied to side surfaces of multilayer ceramic substrates obtained by dividing the sintered multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the side surfaces corresponding to part of the inside surfaces of the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so as to form conductors for forming the external terminal electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> that are not provided with conductors may be formed together with the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provided with the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> described in the above embodiments. In the case described above, the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> are formed only to obtain a superior dividing property, and an appropriate number thereof may be disposed along the dividing lines <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Next, the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which were formed on both sides of the sintered multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, were removed by polishing using a brush, thereby obtaining the multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the surface portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Next, electroless nickel plating and electroless gold plating were performed for the multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Consequently, nickel plating films and gold plating films were preferably deposited on the surfaces of the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which were exposed at the inside surfaces of the through-holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> When the maximum warpage per unit length in a predetermined direction of this multilayer mother substrate was measured, the warpage was merely 0.10%. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> These cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> were provided on dividing lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Next, an inorganic paste <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> containing an inorganic powder, which had the same composition as that of the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, was filled in the slit-shaped cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Next, a firing step was performed under the conditions equivalent to those in the Example, and the shrinkage suppression layers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> were removed in a manner similar to that in the Example, thereby obtaining a fired multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provided with the cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in the surface portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> When the maximum warpage per unit length in a predetermined direction of this multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> was measured, the warpage was 0.10% which is approximately equal to that obtained in the Example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> When the multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> was divided along the dividing lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at which the cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> were provided, a superior dividing property could be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> However, the cut-in grooves <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> did not penetrate in the second comparative example, and since smooth flow of a plating solution could not be expected, electroless plating could not be preferably performed on this multilayer mother substrate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for depositing plating films on surfaces of the conductors <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The process performed in this Second Comparative Example is similar to that described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2000-176928 described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> As has thus been described, when the green composite laminate having the shrinkage suppression layers and the green multilayer mother substrate provided therebetween is formed according to the present invention, undesired deformation or strains are unlikely to occur in the fired multilayer mother substrate, and in addition, the division thereof can be smoothly performed along the dividing lines since the through-holes are formed on the dividing lines which are used for obtaining the multilayer ceramic substrates from the multilayer composite laminate so as to penetrate at least the green multilayer mother substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the production efficiency of the multilayer ceramic substrate can be improved since a multilayer mother substrate having a larger area can be formed, and in addition, cracking and chipping are unlikely to occur in the multilayer ceramic substrate in a dividing step, whereby the production yield of the multilayer ceramic substrate can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In addition, parts of the side surfaces of the multilayer ceramic substrate obtained by the division correspond to parts of the inside surfaces of the through-holes. These parts of the inside surfaces of the through-holes forming the parts of the side surfaces of the multilayer ceramic substrate can be advantageously used for forming the external terminal electrodes. Since such external terminal electrodes described above are provided in recesses which are formed by dividing the through-holes, the positions and the widths of the external terminal electrodes can be formed with high accuracy, and hence, miniaturization of the multilayer ceramic substrate and higher wiring density can be advantageously realized. In addition, even when abnormal deposition of plating films occurs, electrical short-circuiting between the external terminal electrodes adjacent to each other becomes unlikely to occur when plating is performed on the external terminal electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> When the cavity is formed in the multilayer ceramic substrate, as described above, the effect of obtaining a superior dividing property described above becomes significantly important since cracking is likely to occur at the cavity portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> When the through-holes, which are one of the features of the present invention, are provided to penetrate the green composite laminate which are formed of the shrinkage suppression layers and the green multilayer mother substrate provided therebetween, the through-holes can be efficiently formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the green multilayer mother substrate comprises the conductors, which are formed into the external terminal electrodes of the multilayer ceramic substrates, and the conductors are exposed at the inside surfaces of the through-holes when they are formed. In addition, after the fired multilayer mother substrate is divided to form the multilayer ceramic substrates, the conductors formed into the external terminal electrodes can be provided in the recesses so as to fulfill the effect described above since the conductors provided on the inside surfaces of the through-holes are divided to form the external terminal electrodes on the side surfaces of the multilayer ceramic substrates and to be exposed to the outside. That is, in addition to the superior dividing property, the through-holes are formed to realize the external terminal electrodes, and hence, through-holes having multifunctionality can be realized. Furthermore, the formation of the external terminal electrodes can be efficiently performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the conductor is formed to extend only to a part of the green multilayer mother substrate in the lamination direction, the amount of solder used for mounting the obtained multilayer ceramic substrates on a motherboard can be decreased, the heights of solder fillets can be determined in accordance with the dimension of the conductor in the lamination direction, and when the multilayer ceramic substrate is used for high-frequency applications, variation in inductance components caused by the solder fillets can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> When the conductors which are formed into the external terminal electrodes are provided so as to be exposed at the inside surfaces of the through-holes, wet plating such as electroless plating may be performed for the multilayer mother substrate to deposit plating films on the surfaces of the conductors, and hence, the step of forming plating films on the external terminal electrodes can be efficiently performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, when the green composite laminate is formed, and when the cut-in grooves are provided along the dividing lines so as to penetrate at least one shrinkage suppression layer and to extend to a part of the green multilayer mother substrate in the thickness direction, a more superior dividing property can be obtained in the step of dividing the fired multilayer mother substrate for obtaining the multilayer ceramic substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> When the cut-in grooves described above are formed, the laminating process and the step of forming the cut-in grooves can be efficiently performed since the step of forming the cut-in grooves is not necessarily performed in the lamination process for forming the green composite laminate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> When the step of forming the cut-in grooves and the step of forming the through-holes are performed after compressing the green composite laminate in the lamination direction, the adhesion between the ceramic green layers forming the green multilayer mother substrate and between the multilayer mother substrate and the shrinkage suppression layers are improved, and the cut-in grooves and the through-holes are then formed under these conditions, whereby the cut-in grooves and the through-holes in a proper state can be reliably provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the ceramic green layers forming the green multilayer mother substrate contain a glass or a crystallized glass in the present invention, sintering of the green multilayer mother substrate can be performed at a relatively low temperature, and wider selection of the inorganic powders contained in the shrinkage suppression layer can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Various changes and modifications can be made in the method and products of this invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. The various embodiments set forth herein were for the purpose of illustration the invention and were not intended to limit it. </paragraph>
