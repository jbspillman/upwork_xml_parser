<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an online shopping method, and, more particularly, to an online shopping method and its system, wherein a third-party unit collects the amount of money to be paid by a user to a Web shop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, with the rapid spread of the Internet, the online shopping services can easily be provided from Web shops on the WWW, by accessing each of the Web servers from a personal computer, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Those products (services) purchased through the Web shop can be paid, using a payment method that requires a credit card for payment. In this case, the user informs a Web server about his/her credit-card information at the time of purchasing the products. Then, the Web server issues a bill for the products to a corresponding credit-card company. Upon this, the credit-card company receives a predetermined amount of money billed in the issued bill from the user&apos;s bank account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a typical example of a conventional online shopping system. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the conventional online shopping system comprises a user terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, an access server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of an ISP (Internet Service Provider) that a user of the user terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is one member, an authentication server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of the ISP, and a Web server <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> for providing online shopping services. Authentication information (including a set of a user name (an account name) and a password) of each member of the ISP is registered in the authentication server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The Web server <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the case where the user uses the online shopping services provided from the Web server <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, through the user terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the user terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> connects to the access server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> through dial-up connection, and uses an Internet connection service upon accomplishment of user authentication. In this case, in order to accomplish the user authentication, the user inputs his/her authentication information, and the access server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> sends the input authentication information to the authentication server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of the authentication information from the access server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the authentication server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> determines whether the sent information is valid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the case where it is determined that the input authentication information is valid, the access server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> assigns the user terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> an IP address, thereby enabling the Internet access through the access server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, in the case where it is determined that the input authentication information is not valid, the access server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> sends a message representing that the user terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can not access the Internet <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the access from any unauthorized users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The user who is permitted to use the Internet connection service can directly access the Web server <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> from the user terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The user refers to a Web page provided by the Web server <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, selects a desired product(s) to be purchased through a predetermined Web shop, and sends ordering information including personal information, such as his/her name, address, phone number, etc. and credit-card information necessary for payment settlement, to the Web server <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of such ordering information from the user, the Web server <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> performs a credit search for investigating the credit-card information included in the received ordering information. If there is no problem in the ordering information as a result of the search, the Web server <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> arranges for delivery of product ordered by the user, in accordance with the input personal information, and requests a credit-card company to pay a predetermined amount of money to be paid for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to such a settlement method using a user credit card, the credit-card information is transmitted over public networks. Hence, the credit-card information may be stolen or accessed by malice or mistake, by someone unauthorized to access a corresponding Web site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Many users do not feel comfortable about providing their credit-card information onto an unfamiliar Web site. Hence, it is obviously demanded that a new payment method be realized in place of the credit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The followings are some payment methods without the need for a credit card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Unexamined Japanese Patent Application KOKAI Publication No H9-282367 discloses a shopping-mediating system for withdrawing a predetermined amount of money for user-purchased goods from a user&apos;s bank account, based on data sent from a shopping mediator for mediating the transaction between customers and a seller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Unexamined Japanese Patent Application KOKAI Publication No. H9-153964 discloses a method of charging users for information-providing services and a user&apos;s bank account as telephone charges, in accordance with telephone calls from the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further, Unexamined Japanese Patent Application KOKAI Publication No. H11-313058 discloses a settlement method of realizing payment settlement between users by a communications company, using a charge collection system for periodically billing subscribers of a communications network for services charges. This method can be adopted for online shopping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Based on thus disclosed techniques, users need to go through further procedures other than the normal procedures for ordering products, so that it is not convenient for the users to use the above services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Unexamined Japanese Patent Application KOKAI Publication No. H10-177552 discloses a method of collectively managing, in a proxy server, user authentication information necessary for accessing Web servers, and sending the user authentication information requested by the Web servers from the proxy server. This method is effective for simplifying the authentication procedures for connecting to the Web servers, in the case where different authentication information are required respectively by different Web servers to be accessed by the users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Even with this method, in the online shopping system, the users need to input their personal information, such as their name, address, phone number, etc. from the user terminal in accordance with a request from the Web servers, and send the input personal information to the Web servers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now specifically be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the schematic structure of preferred embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the online shopping system comprises a user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a service-providing unit (third-party unit) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which includes repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is an information processor, such as a personal computer, etc., and includes a predetermined input/output device, a display device, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is an information processor, such as a workstation, etc. for providing online shopping services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected with each other through the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, while an online shopping service is being provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In fact, a plurality of user terminals <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a plurality of Web servers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are included in the online shopping system. For the sake of simplicity, however, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows only one user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and one Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above-described repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes an authentication unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a client-identifier setting unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a history recorder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a settlement unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The authentication unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> stores authentication information (e.g. a set of a user name (account name) and a password) of a proper (authorized) user, and performs user authentication for allowing only those proper users to use the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The user of the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> needs to be authenticated by this authentication unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, in the case where the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> intends to connect to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The client-identifier setting unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> temporarily assigns the authenticated user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> a uniquely-set client identifier, and stores the client identifier and the authentication information of the user in association with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the case where the client identifier needs to be invalid, the client-identifier setting unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> invalidates the assigned client identifier. In this case, the client identifier may include, for example, a set of an IP address of the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and time information, representing the time the user is authenticated, in association with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The client identifier is invalidated, when the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> completes connecting to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. That is, the client identifier is valid during a period of time, since the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is authenticated by the authentication unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> until the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> completes connecting to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Note that the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has completed connecting to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, in the case where the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> positively expresses that it intends to complete connecting to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, or in the case where no data is transmitted from the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a predetermined period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> When transmitting data to the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> affixes the assigned client identifier to the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> receives the data to which the client identifier is affixed, from the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In response to this, in the case where the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends predetermined data to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> affixes the same client identifier to the predetermined data to be sent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> relays between the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for transmitting data with a valid client identifier affixed thereto. In the case where the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> intends to sent a personal-information request, to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, for personal information including a receiver name of a product to be delivered, the addressee for delivery, the phone number of the receiver, etc., the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> transmits this request to the personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Then, the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> relays a set-personal information request provided from the personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> sends at least a part of data to be transmitted between the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to the history recorder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> stores personal information (e.g. name, address, phone number of a user) of a proper user. Upon reception of the personal-information inquiry request from the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> acquires a user ID specified in the client identifier affixed to this request from the client-identifier setting unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and reads personal information of the corresponding user from the stored personal information. The personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> sends a set-personal information request, including the inquiry request having the personal information affixed thereto, to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The history recorder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> stores at least a part of data to be transmitted between the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as history data of the user, in association with a user ID affixed thereto. In this case, the history recorder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> acquires the user ID affixed to the transmission data and specified in the client identifier, from the client-identifier setting unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The settlement unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> sums up the total price of purchased products for each user or each Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, based on the history data stored in the history recorder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The settlement unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> acts as a collector which collects a predetermined amount of money to be collected and paid from the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an alphabetical symbol &ldquo;M&rdquo; denotes a machine-readable recording medium, such as a CD-ROM, a semiconductor memory, a magnetic disk unit, etc. The recording medium records a program for controlling the service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This program is read out by a computer including the third-party unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and controls operations of this computer, so as to realize the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the authentication unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the client-identifier setting unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the history recorder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the settlement unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Operations of the online shopping system having the above-described structure will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Let it be assumed that the user of the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is represented by &ldquo;U&rdquo;, and authentication information of the user is represented by &ldquo;U1/P1&rdquo; as a set of the user ID &ldquo;U1&rdquo; and a password &ldquo;P1&rdquo;. The authentication unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> stores &ldquo;U1/P1&rdquo;. The personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> stores the personal information, such as the name, address, phone number of the user U, in association with the user ID &ldquo;U1&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the case where the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> accesses the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for online shopping, the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inputs the authentication information &ldquo;U1/P1&rdquo;. Upon this, the authentication unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> determines whether the user is a proper user. In the case where it is determined that the user is a proper user, the client-identifier setting unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> assigns the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> a client identifier, and stores the assigned client identifier in association with the user ID U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> affixes the assigned client identifier to a request for accessing the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and sends this request to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Only in the case where the client identifier assigned to the request is valid, the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> relays this access request to the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> affixes the client identifier to contents of its Web site, and sends the Web site contents to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which has sent the access request thereto, via the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits data having the client identifier affixed thereto, via the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends, to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the personal-information request, having the client identifier affixed thereto and addressed to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Upon this, only in the case where the affixed client identifier is valid, the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> transmits this personal-information request to the personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> acquires a user ID &ldquo;U1&rdquo; corresponding to the affixed client identifier from the client-identifier setting unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and reads out personal information of the user &ldquo;U&rdquo; corresponding to this user ID &ldquo;U1&rdquo;. Then, the personal-information responding unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> sends a set-personal information request, including the inquiry request having the personal information affixed thereto, to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of the set-personal information request, the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> relays this request to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives the set-personal information request, and displays the received information on a predetermined display device. The user &ldquo;U&rdquo; checks the set-personal information request displayed on the display device, and sends the personal information as is if the contents of the set-personal information request is correct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In the case where the user wants to make a change in the set-personal information request, e.g. in the case where the user wants to change the address for delivery, the user changes only the target part of the personal information, and sends the personal information. Thus checked or changed personal information is sent to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> together with the client identifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the case where the affixed client identifier is valid, the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> sends the personal information to the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> arranges for the delivery of an ordered product, in accordance with the personal information acquired from the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> creates a bill showing information items, including the ordered product, the address for delivery, the amount billed, the slip number of the bill, etc. which are written thereon. The Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> affixes the client identifier to the created bill, and sends the bill to the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to which the client identifier is affixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the case where the affixed client identifier is a valid identifier, the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> relays the bill to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In simultaneous with the above-described operations, the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> transmits at least a part of the data to be sent between the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to the history recorder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Upon this, the history recorder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> acquires a user ID &ldquo;U1&rdquo; corresponding to the client identifier affixed to the data, from the client-identifier setting unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, stores the data as history data in association with the user ID &ldquo;U1&rdquo;. This is because billing data sent from the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> needs to be retained as history data, so that the settlement can be achieved by the settlement unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The settlement unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> acts as a collector for collecting a predetermined amount of money to be paid by the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, based on the billing data stored in the history recorder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the settlement unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> searches the history data classified according to user ID and stored in the history recorder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, for the billing data. After this, the settlement unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> calculates the online shopping charge charged to the user having the corresponding user ID, based on the quantity of the ordered products and the unit price thereof which are included in the billing data, and sends the bill to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In the case where the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends a bill for the online shopping to the service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the settlement unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> searches the history data for a bill representing the charge to be paid to this corresponding Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Then, the settlement unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> calculates the online shopping charge to be paid to the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and pays the calculated charge, based on the unit price and quantity of the product written in the bill </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> According to the online shopping systems of the present invention, the service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> acts as the collector for collecting the charge to be paid from the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Hence, the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> need not inform the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> about the credit card information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the case where the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends a request for personal information, including the addressee for delivery, etc., the personal information which has registered in advance in the service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is sent to the user terminal in a set format Thus, what the user needs to do is to correct only the necessary part of the personal information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Further, the client-identifier setting unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> temporarily assigns the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> a uniquely-set client identifier, at the time of user authentication. When sending data between the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> affix the assigned client identifier to the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> withdraws an access request having no valid client identifier affixed thereto. Thus, the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can assume that any user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which access the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a trusted user terminal, so that the business can be safely performed between the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> withdraws the billing data having not valid client identifier, and thus obstructing any invalid bills from the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> There is proposed another relaying method of relaying only data to/from the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has been authenticated by the authentication unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. According to such a relaying method, a set of the IP address and user ID of the authenticated user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stored. Subsequently, data, which is sent from the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and whose sender IP address does not coincide with the stored IP address, and data, which is sent to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and whose sender IP address does not coincide with the stored IP address, are invalidated. However, such a method is not adopted in the system of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Explanations will now be made to a relaying method of controlling the validity or invalidity of data to be relayed. Note that, in such this relaying method, the client identifier including the IP address and the authentication time information is generated, and the set of the client identifier and user ID is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the case where the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can not access the Internet only through the ISP, an IP address is automatically assigned to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the ISP authenticates the user. The same IP address can not be assigned to different user terminals <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which are accessing the ISP at the same time. However, in the case where a user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has already completed accessing the ISP, the same IP address as that of this user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be assigned to a different user terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Let it be assumed that an IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo; is assigned to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a predetermined user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;, without any client identifier. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, in the case where the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo; disconnects the line right after he/she has just ordered a product from the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the assigned IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo; is once invalidated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> After this, the same IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo; is assigned to a different user &ldquo;U2&rdquo;. At this time, if the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends data regarding the bill of the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;, this data is stored in association with the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo;, since the service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> stores the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo; as a user corresponding to the IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo;. As a result of this, the bill data is relayed to the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo;. Hence, in the worst case, the bill may possibly be sent to the user who has not purchased the products claimed in the bill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Let it be assumed that a client identifier including the IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo; and the authentication time &ldquo;t1&rdquo; is assigned to the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, in the case where the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo; disconnects the line right after the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo; has just ordered a product from the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo; is once invalidated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> After this, in the case where the same IP address is assigned to the different user &ldquo;U2&rdquo;, a client identifier &ldquo;a&plus;t2&rdquo; is assigned to the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo;. The authentication time of the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo; differs from the authentication time &ldquo;t1&rdquo; of the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;. Thus, the client identifier &ldquo;a&plus;t2&rdquo; differs from a client identifier &ldquo;a&plus;t1&rdquo; of the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Further, in the case where the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends data regarding the bill toward the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;, the client identifier affixed to this data is &ldquo;a&plus;t1&rdquo; which is not currently valid. Therefore, the data regarding the bill is invalidated. In such circumstances, it is preventable that a bill is sent to the user who has not purchased the products claimed in the bill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The explanations have been made to the case where the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can access the Internet only through the ISP. The user terminal may be a terminal, which has an IP address for Internet connection so as to directly access the Internet. Even in this case, if a plurality of users having respective user IDs use the same user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> one after another, a client identifier is necessary for each of the plurality of users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Specifically, in the case where the IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo; is assigned as the user ID without a client identifier, and the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo; uses the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo;, for example. In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, in the case where the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo; disconnects the line right after he/she has just ordered a product from the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo; is invalidated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> After this, the different user &ldquo;U2&rdquo; begins to use the same user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At this time, if data regarding the bill addressed to the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;, the bill data is stored in association with the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo;, because the service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> stores the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo; as the user corresponding to the IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Further, this bill data is relayed to the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo;. Therefore, in the worst case, the bill may possibly be sent to the user who has not purchased the product claimed in the bill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> A client identifier including, for example, an IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo; and the authentication time &ldquo;t1&rdquo;, is assigned to the user of the user ID (U1). In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, if the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo; disconnects the line right after the user has just ordered a product from the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the IP address &ldquo;a&rdquo; is invalidated. After this, even if the different user &ldquo;U2&rdquo; uses the same user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the client identifier of the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo; differs from that of the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;. This is because the client identifier &ldquo;a&plus;t2&rdquo; of the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo; differs from that of the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;, and the authentication time &ldquo;t2&rdquo; of the user &ldquo;U2&rdquo; differs from the authentication time &ldquo;t1&rdquo; of the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;. Thus, if the Web server <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends data regarding the bill for purchased products to the user &ldquo;U1&rdquo;, the client identifier &ldquo;a&plus;t1&rdquo; is affixed to this data. Because this client identifier &ldquo;a&plus;t1&rdquo; is not currently valid, the bill data is invalidated. Therefore, it is preventable that a bill is sent to the user who has not purchased the products claimed in the bill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the client identifier is composed of an IP address and the authentication time. However, the client identifier may include only the authentication time. The system of the present invention may include a counter which is incremented every time a client identifier is affixed to data, and a client identifier may be composed of a combination of the counted value and its corresponding IP address or may include the counted value only. </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is an information terminal, such as a personal computer, etc. The user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes hardware devices, such as a CPU, a memory, a keyboard, a CRT, a modern and the like, and has necessary software including the browser, etc. installed therein. A Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is an information processor, such as a workstation, etc. for providing online shopping services. The Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has hardware devices, such as a CPU, a memory, a modem, etc. and necessary software, for acting as a server, installed therein. Note that there exist a plurality of user terminals and a plurality of Web servers, however, only one user terminal and only one Web server are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises an access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, an authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and a settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. This service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is managed by an ISP that the user of a user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has subscribed to. In this embodiment, the ISP acts as the service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are connected to Internet <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. The authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected to the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> respectively through communications lines <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is connected to the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> respectively through communications lines <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of an ISP through a subscribers&apos; line <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The user of the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through dial-up connection, when accessing the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through the Internet <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. The user of the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> gets an IP address and a client identifier assigned thereto, and uses the Internet connection service. In the case where the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> sends data, it sets the assigned IP address as a sender address. When accessing the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> affixes the assigned client identifier to request data for accessing the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> assigns an IP address to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which has connected thereto. For user authentication, the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> sends this IP address and user-input authentication information to the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through the communications line <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Only in the case where the user is successfully authenticated, the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> sends the IP address and a client identifier sent from the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and provides the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with an Internet connection service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In the case where the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is disconnected from the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, or in the case where the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has sent no data to the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for a predetermined period of time, the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> informs the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> about the user ID of the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. This client identifier corresponding to the user ID is invalidated by the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> stores authentication information (e.g. a combination of a user name (account name) and its corresponding password) of each subscriber of the ISP, in advance. The authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has a function for generating client identifiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of an IP address and authentication information from the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> determines whether the received authentication information coincides with the user-authentication information stored in advance in the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In the case where it is determined that the received authentication information coincides with the stored information, the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> affixes present-time information affixed to the IP address, sent from the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> together with the user authentication information, so as to generate a client identifier. The authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> sends the generated client identifier together with the determination result to the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the communications line <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Further, the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> sends this client identifier together with the user ID included in the user authentication information, to the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via the communications line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In the case where it is determined the received authentication information does not coincide with the stored information, the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> sends the determination result to the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> sends this determination result to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, thereby refusing the connection to the Internet <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> relays between the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> stores, in an internal memory, a set of a user ID and client identifier sent from the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of a user ID corresponding to a client identifier to be invalidated from the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> erases a corresponding set of a user ID and a client identifier from the internal memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Of data sent from the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and data sent from the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> relays only data, to which the same client identifier as the internally-stored client identifier is affixed. Further, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> detects a personal-information request which is sent from the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and acquires corresponding user personal information from the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> After this, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> affixes the detected request to the acquired personal information so as to generate a set-personal information request, and relays the generated set-personal information request to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> transmits billing data to the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, so as to record the transmission history of the billing data sent from the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> stores personal information (including a name, address, phone number, etc.) of each subscriber of the ISP, in association with user ID. The database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> stores the billing data transmitted from the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in association with user ID, and sends the billing data in response to a request from the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> charges each subscriber of the ISP for the Internet connection service provided thereto. The settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> specifies a predetermined user ID, and acquires billing data corresponding to the specified user ID from the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> acts as a charge collector for collecting the service charge to be paid by the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> sends, to the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a connection request through dial-up connection to the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the subscribers&apos; line <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> using a modem installed in the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of this connection request from the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> requests the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to input authentication information (Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). In response to the request, the user sends the authentication information from the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives this authentication information from the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and assigns the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> an IP address (Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). The access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> sends the assigned IP address and the input authentication information input by the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, via the communications line <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and requests the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for user authentication (Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> collates the received authentication information with authentication information registered in advance in the authentication-information table <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, thereby determining whether the received authentication information is valid (Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In the case where the received authentication information does not coincide with any authentication information in the authentication-information table <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> determines that the user-input authentication information is not valid, and sends failure-information representing that the user is not successfully authenticated to the access server <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the communications line <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, in the case where the received authentication information coincides with the information in the authentication-information table <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, the authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> determines that the user-input information is valid, and generates a client identifier, which includes the sent IP address and the present-time information (Step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). The authentication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> sends the generated client identifier and the user ID included in the authentication information to the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via the communications line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and requests the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to register them (Step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> stores the sent client identifier and user ID in its internal memory (Step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for explaining this stage for executing a process for relaying data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In the case where the user of the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, having been authorized to connect to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, accesses the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> sends a connection request for connecting to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> thereto, via the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, together with the assigned client identifier (Step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> determines whether there is a client identifier affixed to the data received from the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In the case where it is determined that a client identifier is affixed to the received data, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> determines whether this client identifier coincides with any of client identifiers registered in its internal memory, so as to determine the validity of the client identifier (Step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In the case where it is determined that there is no client identifier affixed to the received data or that the affixed client identifier is not valid, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> does not relay between the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and abandons the request to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In the case where a valid client identifier is affixed to the received data, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> relays the connection request to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). The proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> determines whether this relayed data should be stored as history data (Step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Only in the case where the data should be stored, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> acquires a user ID corresponding to the client identifier of the data, from the internal memory. Then, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> sends the data to the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> via the communications line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, together with the user ID, and requests the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to register the sent data (Step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>). Note that specific explanations will later be made to a method of determining what data should be stored as history data. The database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> stores those data that the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has requested to register, according to user ID (Step S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Upon successful reception of the connection request from the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> sends a Web page including information regarding various products to be provided, to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). In this case, the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> sends the Web page to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, together with the client identifier affixed to the connection request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> checks the validity of the client identifier likewise the case of the step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, in the case where a valid client identifier is not affixed to the connection request, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> abandons this request without relaying it to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Likewise in the step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> determines whether the Web page is history data to be recorded (Step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). In the case where it is determined that the data to be relayed is the history data, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> acquires a user ID corresponding to a client identifier affixed to the data from the internal memory. The proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> sends this data to be relayed to the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> via the communications line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, together with the acquired user ID, and requests the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to register the sent data (Step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of the data and the user ID from the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> stores the data that the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has requested to register, in association with their user IDs (Step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> After this, in the case where data transmission is performed between the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the same operations as those described above are performed by the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Explanations will now be made to a predetermined process which is carried out by the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in the case where the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> sends a personal-information request to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Likewise the above, in this stage (4), the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> determines whether the affixed client identifier is valid and whether the data to be relayed is the history data. However, such determinations will not be shown again in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Let it be assumed that the user of the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has selected a predetermined product item to be purchased on a Web page provided by the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, in this stage (4). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> sends a request for user personal information to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, when delivering the product item ordered by the user of the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of the request for user personal information from the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> reads out a user ID corresponding to a valid client identifier affixed to the received request from its internal memory, and requests the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> for the personal information while specifying the read user ID (Step S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). The database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> searches the personal-information table <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for corresponding personal information, with reference to the user ID (Step S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>). The database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> sends the searched personal information to the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via the communications line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of the personal information from the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> adds the personal information to the personal-information request sent from the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in the step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, so as to generate a set-personal information request (Step S<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>). After this, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> sends the generated set-personal information request to the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> displays the received set-personal information request, so that the user can check or correct the displayed personal information thereon (Step S<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>). The user checks the contents of the set-personal information request, and sends the personal information as is if the contents of the set-personal information request is correct. In the case where the user wants to change a part of the personal information, the user corrects the personal information, executes an operation for sending the corrected personal information, and sends the requested personal information to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> via the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of the personal information from the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> relays the personal information to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, only in the case where a valid client identifier is affixed to the information (Step S<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> (5) Method of Detecting History Data to Be Recorded </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> According to one method of detecting history data, a model of data to be recorded as history data is registered in advance, and data which coincides with the registered model is set as target history data to be recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> For example, with reference to the billing data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, such history data to be recorded is described in the form of HTML text or XML text, and the format of the description is determined in accordance with each Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Thus, formats of the billing data are registered in advance in the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and it is determined whether the format of data to be relayed coincides with any of the registered formats. By so doing, it can be detected whether the data to be relayed is the history data to be recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> According to a similar method, the personal-information request shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A and the personal-information response shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference> can be set as history data to be recorded. This method can be used for detecting the personal-information request, in the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> According to another method, a predetermined symbol representing whether to store as history data is affixed to target data to be sent, and the target data with the symbol affixed thereto is sent from the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> or the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Upon reception of the target data, the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> determines whether the target data is history data to be recorded, based on the predetermined symbol affixed to the target data. This method can be used for detecting the personal information request in the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Note that the predetermined symbol may be formed in any predetermined bit string. In addition, the predetermined symbol may be affixed to the data in accordance with the same manner as that of the client identifier, or may be affixed to the header or body section of HTML text or XML text. The kind (the billing data, the personal-information request, etc.) of the target data may be identifier based on the predetermined symbol. Further, in the case where the target data to be sent is the personal information request, if the context (address, phone number, etc.) of requested personal information is specified in the header section in association with the predetermined symbol, it is not necessary to analyze the body section of the text. This results in the improvement of the process efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> (6) Stage for Making/Paying Bill for Product/Service </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> When making a bill for an Internet-connection service to each subscriber of an ISP, the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> sends a bill(s) for online-shopping to the subscriber. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for explaining a process for making bill for each subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> From the history data stored in the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> according to user ID, the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> extracts all non-transmitted billing data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, which has not yet been sent to the user, in association with the user ID of the subscriber (Step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>). Next, the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> multiplies the quantity of products written in the bill by the unit charge, so as to obtain the amount billed per transaction, and obtains the total charge for the entire bills to be sent to the subscriber (Step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). The settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> adds the summed total charge with the Internet-connection service charge addressed to the subscriber (Step S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>), so as to make a bill addressed to the user (Step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>). At the time of making this bill, the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> affixes a predetermined mark representing that the bill is issued, to the processed billing data, and stores the billing data with the predetermined mark affixed thereto, in the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The bill addressed to the user includes not only the calculated total charge, but also the detail statement of online shopping charges. This detail statement is formed based on the billing data sent from the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Thus created bill addressed to the user is sent to the subscriber by post, and the amount billed is collected in accordance with a predetermined method (e.g. directly paying from the user&apos;s bank account, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> When the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> requests payment for online shopping charges, the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> calculates the online shopping charges to be paid to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, based on the billing data stored in the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. After this, the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> pays the calculated charges to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a predetermined payment method, for example, a payment method directly to the specified bank account by the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a settlement process for paying the charges for each transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of a bill indicating a predetermined slip number of a bill from the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> searches the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> for the billing data in association with the indicated bill number (Step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>). If there are different non-transmitted billing data having the same bill number (Step S<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>; YES), the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> multiplies the quantity of the products written in the bill by the unit charge of the products, so as to obtain the amount billed per transaction, and pays the obtained amount of money to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>). In this case, the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may add a predetermined service charge into the bill. In the case where the payment is successfully performed, the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> affixes the predetermined symbol representing that the payment has been accomplished to the processed billing data, and stores the billing data with the symbol in the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In the case where there is no corresponding billing data (Step S<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>: NO), the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> executes an error process (Step S<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows the flow of products and their prices (charges) to be paid, in the online shopping system according to this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> A Web shop delivers a product ordered by the user (the subscriber) to the address for delivery, in accordance with an order sent from the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the Web server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and sends a bill for the product to the ISP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> If the ISP receives a bill addressed to the user from the Web shop, the ISP pays the amount billed in the received bill for the user, and charges the user for the paid amount of money. In this case, the ISP collects the online shopping charges at the same time it collects the Internet service charge, from the user. The user receives the product from the Web shop, and paid the charge to the ISP. </paragraph>

Unlike the user terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> included in the system or the first embodiment, the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a communications interface for directly connecting to Internet <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is connected directly to the Internet <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> through a communications line <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> A Web server <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is an information processor, such as a workstation, etc. for providing online shopping services, includes hardware devices, such as a CPU, a memory, a keyboard, a CRT, a modem, and the like, and has necessary software including the browser, etc. installed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows only one user terminal and one Web server by way of example. However, in fact, there are a plurality of user terminals and Web servers over the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The service-providing unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprises an authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a database server <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and a settlement server <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, and is managed by the same business organization as that of the first embodiment. The authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> and with each other through a communications line <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The database server <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is connected to the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and a settlement server <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> respectively through communications lines <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> The user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> accesses a Web server <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> through the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is authenticated by the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to use the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> assigns the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> a client identifier. The user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> affixes the assigned client identifier to an access request for accessing the Web server <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> through the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. When the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> completes using the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, it sends information representing the completion of using the Web server <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, together with the user ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> stores authentication information (e.g. a set of a user name (account name) and a passsword) of each member using the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has a function for generating client identifiers. Upon reception of authentication information from the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> determines whether the received authentication information coincides with valid authentication information registered in advance therein. In the case where it is determined that the transmitted authentication information coincides with the registered information, the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> sets a set of an IP address of the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the authentication time, as a client identifier. The authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> sends the set client identifier with the user ID included in the authenticaton information, to the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> through the communications line <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> When the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> receives the information representing the completion of using the Web server <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, from the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> together with the user ID, the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> instructs the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to invalidate the client identifier corresponding to the user ID of the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> The proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> has a function for relaying data between the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the Web server <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> stores the set of the user ID and the client identifier which are sent from the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, in its internal memory. Upon reception of the instruction for invalidating the client identifier from the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> invalidates the set of the user ID and the client identifier specified in the invalidation instruction. In addition, in the case where there is no data transmission from the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for a predetermined period of time, the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> invalidates the stored set of the user ID and the client identifier. Other than the above, the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> has the same function as that of the proxy server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> included in the online shopping system of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> The database server <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the settlement server <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> have the same function as those of the database server <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the settlement server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> described in the first embodiment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> The authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> collates the received authentication information with the authentication information registered in the authentication-information table <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, thereby determining whether the received authentication information is valid (Step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In the case where it is determined that the received authentication information does not coincide with any authentication information registered in the table, the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> determines that the user-input authentication information is not valid. After this, the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> sends a denial response representing that the requested connection can not be made, to the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through the Internet <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, in the case where it is determined that the received authentication information coincides with that registered in the table <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> determines that the user-input information is valid, and generates a client identifier using the IP address of the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the present time (Step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). The authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> sends a set of the generated client identifier and the user ID specified in the authentication information to the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> through the communications line <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, so as to request the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to register the set of the client identifier and user ID (Step S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). The proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> stores the received set of the client identifier and the user ID in its internal memory (Step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of a response representing that the set of the client identifier and the user ID has completely been registered (Step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>), the authentication server <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> sends success information representing that the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can connect to the Web server <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, to the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, together with the client identifier (Step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> In the case where to access the Web server <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the user of the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is allowed to connect to the Web server <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> in the step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> sends a connection request to the Web server <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> through the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, together with the assigned client identifier. Subsequent operations are the same as those described in the first embodiment. Note that there is no access server between the user terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the proxy server <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in the online shopping system of this embodiment, unlike the structure of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the present invention, the user can utilize the online shopping services, without the risk of transmitting credit-card information over public networks. This is because the third-party unit acts as a collector which collects the service charges for the online shopping, that should be paid from the user terminal to the Web server. Thus, those users who do not possess any credit card can use the online shopping services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> The user can simply access the Web server via the repeater <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through easy processes, so that the online shopping services can also easily realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> The Web server can assume that a user terminal which accesses through the repeater is a trusted user terminal, thereby safely realizing the business between the two. This is because only the user which has been authenticated by the third-party unit can access the Web server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> A bill without a valid client identifier assigned to the user terminal is invalidated, thereby preventing any invalid bills from being sent to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> The third-party unit can acquire information representing any products purchased by the user at the Web shop, thereby also acquiring information representing user preferences in a certain field. For example, those Web pages that the user has browsed may be stored as history data, other than the billing data, the online shopping system of the present invention can acquire the user preferences more specifically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The system of the present invention can be realized by a general computer, without the need for a dedicated system. A program and data for controlling a computer to execute the above-described processes may be recorded on a medium (a floppy disk, CD-ROM, DVD or the like) and distributed, and the program may be installed into the computer and run on an OS (Operating System) to execute the above-described processes, thereby achieving the system of the present invention. The above program and data may be stored in a disk device or the like in the server device on the Internet, and embedded in a carrier wave. The program and data embedded in the carrier wave may be downloaded into the computer so as to realize the system of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments and changes may be made thereonto without departing from the broad spirit and scope of the invention. The above-described embodiments are intended to illustrate the present invention, not to limit the scope of the present invention. The scope of the present invention is shown by the attached claims rather than the embodiments. Various modifications made within the meaning of an equivalent of the claims of the invention and within the claims are to be regarded to be in the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
