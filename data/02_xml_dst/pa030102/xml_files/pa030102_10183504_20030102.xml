<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a wireless communication device for transmitting and receiving information by using a wireless frequency band of 10 &lsqb;MHz&rsqb; to 5 &lsqb;GHz&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A baby monitor for hearing a baby&apos;s voice from a separated room (within the range from 5, 6 meters to 150 meters) as a device in a &ldquo;toy commodity market&rdquo; for children used in e.g., the interior of the United States of America is known as a conventional wireless communication device. In this baby monitor, a two-crystal system of two channels is adopted in a receiver and crystal control FM (frequency modulation) of two channels is adopted in a transmitter so that information transmission and reception corresponding to the two channels can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A monitor/hand-free mutual communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,091,329 as a system having the two crystals on the receiving and transmitting sides of the wireless communication device. In the wireless communication device of this U.S. Pat. No. 6,091,329, an RF circuit from an antenna high frequency (RF) circuit to a demodulating circuit (FM ratio detector) is constructed by arranging six transistors and two demodulation wave detection diodes. In this circuit construction, crystal resonators are required in a local oscillating circuit by the number of channels as using frequencies. Namely, this wireless communication device has two crystal resonators on each of the transmitting and receiving sides to cope with the two channels, and selects each channel by a switch. The local oscillating circuit generally has a variable capacitor to finely adjust an oscillating frequency of about several &lsqb;Hz&rsqb; in each crystal resonator. With respect to such technical specification of the wireless communication device such as the baby monitor, for example, the wireless communication device is produced as a device conforming to the standard of America Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as an administrative committee in an information-communication field in the United States of America. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, in the circuit construction of the conventional wireless communication device, the RF circuit from the antenna high frequency circuit to the demodulating circuit (FM ratio detector) is constructed by six transistors and two demodulation wave detection diodes, using no crystal resonator. Further, the band of an intermediate frequency amplifying circuit is widened to compensate an unstable characteristics in the local oscillator. Therefore, a problem existed in that receiving sensitivity is very bad. On the other hand, when a crystal resonator and a variable capacitor for finely adjusting the oscillating frequency of the oscillator is arranged, the range of the finely adjustable frequency is a narrow range of about several &lsqb;Hz&rsqb;. Therefore, a problem existed in that the oscillating frequency becomes unstable when the oscillating frequency exceeds this range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, in the conventional wireless communication device, expensive crystal resonators (crystal oscillators), variable capacitors for finely adjusting the oscillating frequency, etc. are required by the number of channels for communicating information in the local oscillating circuit. When this channel number is two or more, a problem exists in that device cost is raised and device size is increased contrary to the need of compactness, etc. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the circuit construction of a receiving section of a wireless communication device in accordance with one embodiment of this invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a view showing one concrete example of circuits shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> described later. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the same reference numerals, signs and characters as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> designate members similar to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> receiving signal (e.g., a modulating signal including voice information) received by an antenna <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is inputted to a low pass filter (LPF) <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> having an inductor and a capacitor (L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) through a loading coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> so that an unnecessary high frequency component is removed from the receiving signal. Here, an unillustrated junction point (JP) exists between the loading coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the low pass filter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and is constructed such that the loading coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the low pass filter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are connected by solder, etc. Since the receiving section has this JP, the receiving section can be easily constructed such that no unnecessary receiving signal is received from the antenna <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> when a test, an inspection, etc. of the receiving section are made. Therefore, the JP is convenient in the test, the inspection, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An output signal from the low pass filter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is inputted to a high frequency amplifying circuit (RF AMP:Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. After high frequency amplification processing, the output signal is inputted to a band pass filter (BPF) <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> having an inductor and a capacitor (T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). Here, a direct current voltage (DC) 3.5 &lsqb;V&rsqb; is applied to the high frequency amplifying circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as a power voltage. The DC 3.5 &lsqb;V&rsqb; is generated by a constant voltage circuit (AVR Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and a Zener diode (D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> connected to this constant voltage circuit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> by using a voltage value from a battery <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>006</bold></highlight>P 9&lsqb;V&rsqb;) or an external direct current power (EXT DC) voltage (&plus;6&lsqb;V&rsqb;). DC 3.5 &lsqb;V&rsqb; is similarly supplied to an IC (IC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>3361</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> described later as a power voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The band pass filter <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> processes an unnecessary component outside a frequency band with respect to a signal inputted from the high frequency amplifying circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and outputs the processed signal to the IC (IC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>3361</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In the IC <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the receiving signal from the band pass filter <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the signal of a frequency from a local oscillating section having a crystal resonator (X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and an oscillator (OSC) circuit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> constructed within the IC <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are mixed by a mixer circuit (MIX) <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> constructed within the IC <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the receiving signal is set to a signal in an intermediate frequency band (e.g., a central frequency of 455 &lsqb;kHz&rsqb;). A channel change-over switch <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is arranged to switch the connection of an inductor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the other end of the crystal resonator <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the ground, or the connection of the other end of the crystal resonator <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to the ground without connecting the inductor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to cope with the receiving signal of e.g., two channels (CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and CH<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When the inductor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is connected to the crystal resonator <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> by the channel change-over switch <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> (on a CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side), the oscillating frequency of the local oscillating section can be set to a frequency of the CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, the fine adjustment of an arbitrary channel can be made by adjusting a core of the inductor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. When the channel change-over switch <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is switched onto this CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side, the oscillating frequency of the local oscillating section can be set to a low frequency in comparison with the case in which the connection to the ground is made without connecting the inductor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. In other words, when no inductor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is connected to the crystal resonator <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> by the channel change-over switch <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> (on a CH<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side), the oscillating frequency can be set to a high frequency in comparison with the CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side. For example, the difference between the oscillating frequencies of the CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the CH<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be set to several ten &lsqb;kHz&rsqb; by the switching of the channel change-over switch <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. This local oscillating section will be described later in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the receiving signal set to the intermediate frequency band by mixing this receiving signal with the frequency from the local oscillating section by the mixer circuit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is inputted to an intermediate frequency limiter amplifying circuit (IF LIM AMP) <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and the intermediate frequency is amplified in this intermediate frequency limiter amplifying circuit <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Processing such as noise removal processing is performed with respect to a signal except for a predetermined frequency range with the intermediate frequency e.g., 455 &lsqb;kHz&rsqb; as a central frequency by a ceramic filter (FL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> connected to the intermediate frequency limiter amplifying circuit <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An output of the intermediate frequency limiter amplifying circuit <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is inputted to a quadrature demodulating circuit (DET) <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and the received modulating signal is demodulated (e.g., FM demodulation is performed when the receiving signal is an FM modulating signal) by this quadrature demodulating circuit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. An output of the quadrature demodulating circuit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is inputted to a noise amplifying circuit <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> within the IC <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and is also inputted to a low frequency amplifying circuit (AF AMP:Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> outside the IC <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through a volume circuit (VR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Advantage of the Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As explained above, the following effects are obtained in accordance with this invention: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> (1) In the wireless communication device of this invention, the local oscillating section has a single crystal resonator, an inductor and a switch for switching whether the inductor is connected in series to the crystal resonator or not. A receiving channel is switched by whether the inductor is connected or not. Accordingly, it is possible to provide a receiving section able to receive plural channels by one crystal resonator. Further, since the local oscillating section is constructed by one crystal resonator, the wireless communication device having a compact receiving section at low cost can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (2) The local oscillating section has a transistor having a base connected to one end of the crystal resonator, a capacitor connected between the base and an emitter of the transistor, an emitter resistor for connecting the emitter to the ground, and a parallel resonating circuit connected in parallel with the emitter resistor and synchronized with the frequency of about an integer times a fundamental frequency of the crystal resonator. The switch switches whether the other end of the crystal resonator is directly connected to the ground, or the other end of the crystal resonator is connected to the ground through the inductor, and capacitance of the capacitor is switched in association with this switching. Therefore, the oscillating frequency of the local oscillating section instabilized by temperature, etc. can be stabilized by the capacitance of the capacitor in association with each channel, can be stabilized by the oscillating frequency of the local oscillating section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> (3) The switch further switches a resistance value of the emitter resistor in association with the switching of the receiving channel. Therefore, an adjustment for uniforming oscillating strength of the oscillating frequency is made and the local oscillating section can be further stably operated. Accordingly, it is possible to provide a wireless communication device having the receiving section of a high general purpose property and conforming to the standard of America Federal Communications Commission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> (4) In the wireless communication device of this invention, a modulating section has a single crystal resonator, a modulating circuit for deviating an oscillating frequency provided by the crystal resonator by an inputted information signal, an inductor connected in series to the crystal resonator, and a switch for switching inductance of the inductor, and a transmitting channel is switched by switching this inductance. Accordingly, it is possible to provide a transmitting section for transmitting information by arbitrarily selecting the plural channels. Further, since only one crystal resonator is arranged, it is possible to provide a wireless communication device having a compact transmitting section at low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> (5) A resistor is connected in parallel with the inductor, and its resistance value is switched in association with the switching of the transmitting channel. Therefore, amplitude (electric potential) at the oscillating frequency instabilized by temperature, etc. is stabilized by arranging the inductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> (6) The modulating section switches a level of the inputted information signal in association with the switching of the transmitting channel. Therefore, a further stable oscillating means can be constructed so that a wireless communication device having a transmitting section having a high general purpose property and conforming to the standard of America Federal Communications Commission can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Further, this invention can be constructed as a transmitting-receiving system for transmitting and receiving wireless information, and can provide a compact transmitting-receiving system manufactured at low cost and conforming to the standard and able to use the plural channels. </paragraph>
