<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a casing cover for use in separating a motor assembly and a pump assembly from each other in a pump device such as a circulating pump for handling fresh water, and a pump device having such a casing cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Pump devices such as a circulating pump for handling fresh water are required to prevent the liquid that is being handled under an increased pressure in a pump casing from leaking out of a high-pressure opening in the pump casing into a motor assembly. To meet such a requirement, it has widely been customary to separate a motor assembly and a pump assembly from each other with a casing cover with a mechanical seal mounted therein for sealing a main shaft and also to seal the pump casing in a water-tight fashion with an O-ring, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings shows, in enlarged fragmentary cross section, a fixed region of a casing cover in a conventional general pump device, the casing cover being formed by pressing a stainless steel plate, for example. The casing cover, generally denoted by <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, has a flat panel portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a flange portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which are integrally formed by pressing a flat plate. The cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has an inner circumferential surface serving as a motor-side faucet-joint surface (motor-side positioning portion) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>held against a motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an outer circumferential surface serving as a pump-side faucet-joint surface (pump-side positioning portion) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>held against a pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The motor-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>i.e. the motor-side register fit surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>is fitted over the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the pump-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>i.e. the pump-side register fit surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>is fitted in the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, providing a faucet-joint structure, i.e. a socket-and-spigot joint (positioning) structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Since the inner and outer circumferential surfaces of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are fitted over and in the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, when the flat plate is pressed to form the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, one of the inner and outer circumferential surfaces of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, e.g., the inner circumferential surface, is used as a dimensional reference to achieve desired dimensional accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, when the flat plate is pressed to form the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, one of the inner and outer circumferential surfaces of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, e.g., the inner circumferential surface, is used as a dimensional reference, since the flat plate generally suffers thickness variations, it is difficult to achieve desired dimensional accuracy for the other of the inner and outer circumferential surfaces of the cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, e.g., the outer circumferential surface. Furthermore, when the pump device is serviced for maintenance, e.g., when the mechanical seal is replaced, because the casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> tends to stick to the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> due to rust or the like, it is difficult to remove the casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while both the inner and outer circumferential surfaces of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are being of normal dimensions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a casing cover which is capable of fitting with members of both a motor assembly and a pump assembly highly accurately in providing a faucet-joint (positioning) structure, and of disassembling and removing a member thereof held in interfitting faucet-joint (positioning) engagement with the members of the motor assembly and the pump assembly while keeping normal dimensions, and a pump device having such a casing cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is provided a casing cover for use in separating a motor assembly and a pump assembly from each other in a pump device, comprising: a cylindrical wall portion having a step, a motor-side positioning portion positioned on one side of the step for being fitted to a member of the motor assembly, and a pump-side positioning portion positioned on the other side of the step for being fitted to a member of the motor assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Since the motor-side positioning portion and the pump-side positioning portion are individually positioned one on each side of the step of the cylindrical wall portion, the casing cover can be formed by pressing a flat plate using both the motor-side positioning portion and the pump-side positioning portion as dimensional references, both the motor-side positioning portion and the pump-side positioning portion can be formed to shape with high dimensional accuracy. The casing cover with such high dimensional accuracy can be assembled easily and quickly in the pump device, and can be disassembled and removed while the motor-side positioning portion and the pump-side positioning portion are being dimensionally maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The motor-side positioning portion may comprise a motor-side faucet-joint surface, and the pump-side positioning portion may comprise a pump-side faucet-joint surface, thereby providing a faucet-joint structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The motor-side faucet-joint surface may be disposed on one of an inner and outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical wall portion, and the pump-side faucet-joint surface may be disposed on the other of the inner and outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical wall portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is also provided a pump device comprising: a motor assembly; a pump assembly; and a casing cover separating the motor assembly and the pump assembly from each other; the casing cover comprising a cylindrical wall portion having a step, a motor-side positioning portion positioned on one side of said step for being fitted to a member of the motor assembly, and a pump-side positioning portion positioned on the other side of said step for being fitted to a member of the motor assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment of the present invention by way of example.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, a pump device according to an embodiment of the present invention has a motor assembly M and a pump assembly P. The motor assembly M has a high-pressure opening in which there is disposed a casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that separates the motor assembly M and the pump assembly P from each other. The casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has its circumferential edge gripped and secured in position between a motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is mounted on an end of the motor assembly M closer to the pump assembly P and a pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the pump assembly P. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The motor assembly M has a main shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extending toward the pump assembly P. The main shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is sealed by a mechanical seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> mounted on an inner circumferential surface of the casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and extends into the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. An impeller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is fixed to the end of the main shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is positioned in the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a suction port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> defined in one end thereof and a discharge port <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> defined in the other end thereof. A liner ring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is fixed, as by pressing, to an end face of the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which surrounds an outer circumferential surface of a suction end of the impeller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. With the liner ring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> being thus positioned, there is defined a restriction between the outer circumferential surface of the suction end of the impeller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and an inner circumferential surface of the liner ring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The restriction has a given gap and separates a higher-pressure region and a lower-pressure region within the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When the motor assembly M is energized, the impeller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> disposed in the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rotates in unison with the main shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, drawing a liquid which is being handled from the suction port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The liquid drawn into the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then pressurized by the impeller <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and then discharged out of the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the discharge port <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a press-formed product that is formed by pressing a stainless steel plate, for example, and has a flat panel portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a flange portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a mechanical seal holder portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which holds the mechanical seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> therein. The cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has an annular step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>positioned somewhere in the axial longitudinal direction of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a larger-diameter region on one side of the annular step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>i.e., closer to the motor assembly M, and a smaller-diameter region on the other side of the annular step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>i.e., closer to the pump assembly P. The cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also has a motor-side faucet-joint surface (motor-side positioning portion) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>i.e. the motor-side register fit surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>on its inner circumferential surface which is fitted over the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a pump-side faucet-joint surface (pump-side positioning portion) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>i.e. the pump-side register fit surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>on its outer circumferential surface which is fitted in the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thus providing a faucet-joint structure, i.e. a socket-and-spigot joint (positioning) structure. The motor-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the pump-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are disposed respectively in the larger-diameter region and the smaller-diameter region, i.e., respectively on the opposite sides of the annular step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is disposed securely in position between the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, with the motor-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>being held in interfitting faucet-joint engagement with the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the pump-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being held in interfitting faucet-joint engagement with the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Therefore, accurate positioning of the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is obtained through the motor-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the pump-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Since the motor-side faucet-joint surface (motor-side positioning portion) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the pump-side faucet-joint surface (pump-side positioning portion) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are individually positioned one on each side of the annular step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be formed by pressing the flat plate using both the motor-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the pump-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as dimensional references. Specifically, the smaller-diameter region of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on one side of the annular step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed using the pump-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or the outer circumferential surface as a dimensional reference, and the larger-diameter region of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the other side of the annular step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed using the motor-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or the inner circumferential surface as a dimensional reference. Accordingly, both the motor-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the pump-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be pressed to shape with high dimensional accuracy. The casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with such high dimensional accuracy can be assembled easily and quickly in the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When the pump device is serviced for maintenance, e.g., when the mechanical seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is replaced, even if the casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sticks to the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> due to rust or the like, the casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be removed while the pump-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on one side of the annular step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is being dimensionally maintained, and the motor-side faucet-joint surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or the inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the other side of the annular step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is being dimensionally maintained. Therefore, the casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be reassembled easily and quickly in the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, as described above, the casing cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of fitting with the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> highly accurately in providing a faucet-joint (positioning) structure, and of disassembling and removing the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> held in interfitting faucet-joint engagement with the motor bracket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the pump casing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> while keeping normal dimensions and also reassembling the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> easily and quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Although a certain preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described in detail, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
