<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an OS (Operating System), and more particularly to a method that can be used with different OS&apos;s to automatically guide a user to link with a network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With the increase in computer popularity and functionality, people often need to use computers to solve problems either at work or at home. In general, two major methods of obtaining information are (1) from books, newspapers, journals, or CD-ROM&apos;s, and (2) from the network. However, both of these methods have some drawbacks. First, the information obtained using the first method will become outdated as time progresses. The rapid exchange of information greatly shortens the life cycle of information. But such information as that recorded in media like books or journals cannot be easily updated. The information obtained using the second method, however, continuously changes along with the developing world around us, also resulting in some troubles for users. One can see the problems from the following points: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1. Existing personal computer OS&apos;s (Operating System), such as MS Windows or Linux, are complicated despite their powerful functions and designs. Moreover, user interface designs are not intuitive and simple enough. This situation scares people without any computer background because of the obstacles they meet while using these systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Users who search for data over a network may waste a lot of time waiting for data transmission due to the slow speed of their network system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 3. Some users may not know where to start their searches because they are not familiar with the network structure. Facing this situation, the user often chooses the OS that s/he is familiar with or installs different OS&apos;s on the computer and switches between them when necessary. Such a system with two co-existing OS&apos;s is called a dual-OS. Nevertheless, not all currently available browsers can help users to link with a network. The user has to enter website addresses by him or her self. The drawback is that when a user has never used a browser or does not know the website address, using browsers becomes a rather difficult task. It is thus highly desirable to provide a simple and convenient OS to solve this problem. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention proposes a method for automatically guiding a user to link with a network. In particular, in contrast to currently available complicated OS&apos;s, a convenient and intuitive UOI (User Operating Interface) is provided herein so that the user can complete a desired effect with a single hot key on a keyboard. Through a network connection, the user can achieve the goal of real-time data browsing, transmission and updating through the one-touch OS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment is given below to demonstrate the feasibility of the disclosed method. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the user starts the one-touch OS (step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). The one-touch OS is stored in an internal storage medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a computer controlled hardware platform. The one-touch OS then produces a browsing interface (step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>), where the browsing interface is provided by a browsing mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the one-touch OS. Therefore, the user can perform actions in a browsing interface work menu through the UOI. The browsing interface then displays a selective menu (step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). The selection item is further divided into the browse directory method (step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) and the browse webpage method (step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>). If step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is selected, then step A follows; if step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is selected, step B follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> refers to an OS that enables a user to complete a function provided in the work group displayed in a UOI <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in one action. The work group is comprised of at least one function item. The one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can operate with different OS&apos;s or alone. The user can choose to switch between the different OS&apos;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>-<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, after entering step A, a list is presented according to the directory type (step <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>). This list shows all file directories in the system. The browsing mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then receives a command and displays the corresponding item (step <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>). The command given by the user is to select an item from the list. Finally, the browsing procedure is completed (step <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>). If the procedure enters step B, the browsing mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides selective input methods for further processing (step <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>). The input methods include an auto input and a manual input. When auto input is selected, the browsing mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> displays a webpage list (step <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>). A command is received and the corresponding webpage is displayed (step <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>). The command is given by the user by clicking a default website address in the one-touch OS. The user can thus open the webpage and browse its contents (step <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>). If manual input is selected, the browsing mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives a plurality of letters (step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) and step C follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>-<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, after entering step C, the browsing mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> determines whether the plurality of letters forms a correct website address (step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>). If it is not a correct website address, the user is asked to enter a new website address (step <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>). If the website address is correct, the browsing mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> calls a dialing module to dial up to the network (step <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>) and automatically establish a connection with the network. Data from a server are accessed (step <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>) and downloaded to the user (step <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>). The browsing mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then produces a browse operating interface (step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>) and returns to step D. Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>-<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the user can open the webpage and browse its contents (step <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can run on any computer controlled hardware platform, such as a PC (Personal Computer), an NB (Notebook), or a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). Any person skilled in the art can make various modifications in order to implement the disclosed method of automatically guiding a user to link with a network in any electronic device that can establish communications with a network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As described above, a user can complete a desired task by performing only a single action. The UOI provides at least one hint menu so that the user can follow the menu to input and execute the task in a single action. In the current embodiment, the single action function offered by the one-touch OS <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> allows the user to press one key on the keyboard according to a selection menu to enter his request. Any key on the keyboard can be set to complete this kind of action. The keys include the number keys 0&tilde;9, the letter keys A&tilde;Z, the function keys F1&tilde;F12 and special keys ESC, TAB, PgUp, END, etc. Aside from the keyboard, single action request input can be accomplished using a mouse or other controllers, such as a digital touch-control panel or a voice recognition system. That is, any basic computer input device can be used to provide one-touch control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When the user wants to browse a particular webpage, the disclosed method can establish a connection with a network according to the data recorded in a database. When the user wants to leave the network service program, the disclosed method can automatically disconnect from the network as well. In other words, the user does not need to perform extra network setting and connection actions. Therefore, the user can use the network services provided by the computer in a more intuitive way. Users who are not familiar with computers will also become more interested in web browsing using computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
