<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a pattern forming method and a semiconductor device manufactured by using the pattern forming method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, the technology of manufacturing a semiconductor device has progressed to arrive at the stage that a semiconductor device having a minimum processing size of 0.18 &mgr;m can be manufactured nowadays on a mass production basis. This prominent miniaturization has been achieved by drastic progress in fine pattern forming technologies such as mask processing technology, photolithography technology and etching technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the era when the pattern size was sufficiently large, a planar shape of a desired LSI pattern was depicted as it was on a wafer as a design pattern so as to form a mask pattern having a high fidelity to the design pattern, and the mask pattern was transferred onto the wafer by a projecting optical system, followed by etching the underlying layer, thereby forming a desired LSI pattern substantially equal to the design pattern on the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, with progress in the miniaturization of the pattern, it has been rendered difficult to form a pattern with high fidelity in each process, giving rise to the problem that the final finish pattern fails to conform with the design pattern. Particularly, in the lithography and etching processes, which are most important for achieving fine processing, a pattern layout arranged in the periphery of a desired pattern, i.e., the peripheral pattern environment, greatly affects the dimensional accuracy of the desired pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Under the circumstances, proposed in, for example, Jpn. Pat. KOKAI Publication No. 9-319067 are an OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) technology, a PPC (Process Proximity Correction) technology, etc., in which a dummy pattern is imparted in advance to a design pattern for forming the size after the processing in a desired pattern so as to suppress the influence described above. The OPC technology noted above denotes the technology for correcting the change in size generated in the lithography process by a pattern. On the other hand, the PPC technology noted above denotes the technology for correcting not only the change in size generated in the lithography process but also the change in size generated by the mask and the etching process by a pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the case of employing OPC technology, it is certainly possible to suppress the process conversion difference, i.e., the difference between the resist size and the design size, derived from the pattern environment in the lithography process to a low level. However, even in the case of employing PPC technology, it was impossible in some cases to suppress completely the process conversion difference, i.e., the difference between the size after the etching and the resist size, derived from the pattern environment in the etching process. The process conversion difference in the etching process was generated mainly by two factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> First of all, the process conversion difference was generated by the etched area in a large region hundreds of times as large as the region of the entire chip or the minimum pattern size that was to be processed. The technology of arranging a dummy pattern differing from a main pattern for controlling the area to be etched is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 2-236549, Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 3-180041, and Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 4-130709. In each of these prior arts, a dummy pattern is formed around a pattern that is to be processed in order to make the area to be etched within the chip as uniform as possible. In Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 3-180041 referred to above, a dummy pattern is arranged on an element separation region alone. On the other hand, in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 4-130709 referred to above, a dummy pattern is arranged around an isolated pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The second factor is the etching process conversion difference generated by only the distance between the pattern to be processed and the adjacent pattern. To be more specific, when a pattern is arranged in an isolated manner, the process size of the pattern after etching is rendered larger than the resist size after the lithography process. In order to suppress the conversion difference, it is necessary to make the size of the resist formed by the lithography process smaller than the desired size in view of the conversion difference generated in the etching process. However, the process margin that can be ensured by the lithography process is very small, with the result that it is very difficult to form a resist pattern smaller than the desired size and to ensure a required process margin. In other words, even in the case of employing PPC technology, it is very difficult to correct the increase in size in the isolated pattern derived from the etching process. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Before describing each embodiment of the present invention, the dependence of the process conversion difference on the peripheral pattern environment will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> exemplifies a mask pattern used for obtaining a process conversion difference by the etching of a gate pattern. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> main pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is selected from among the mask patterns <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the mask pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> arranged in the vicinity of the selected main pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is used as an adjacent pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. It should be noted that the main pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the adjacent pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged apart from each other by a distance X, and the distance X is changed variously depending on the desired size. The process conversion difference by the etching of the gate pattern will now be studied by using these mask patterns <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> schematically shows the flow of the pattern formation of a gate. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> resist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed by lithography by using the mask pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed by etching using the resist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In general, the pattern correction is performed by the lithography process using OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) technology. Also, in the etching process, pattern correction is performed by using PPC (Process Proximity Correction) technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a graph showing the etching conversion difference accompanying the change in the distance X between the adjacent mask patterns. The etching conversion difference noted above represents the process conversion difference by the etching, covering the case where the size of the resist pattern is subtracted from the size of the gate pattern. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the etching conversion difference increases with the increase in the distance X between the adjacent mask patterns <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, i.e., the distance X shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> between the main pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the adjacent pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In other words, the size of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is rendered greater than the size of the resist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, if the adjacent pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is not present around the main pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so as to increase the degree of isolation of the main pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. It follows that the etching conversion difference changes depending on the distance X between the adjacent mask patterns <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Each embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, with the above taken into consideration. Throughout the drawings, common portions are represented by common reference numerals. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIRST EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, a dummy pattern is arranged in the design stage. The pattern forming method according to the first embodiment of the present invention is adapted for the formation of a custom-designed device pattern such as a DRAM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the pattern forming method according to the first embodiment of the present invention. The pattern forming method according to the first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> First of all, the allowable value of the etching conversion difference is determined in respect of the allowable limit of the difference between the size of the gate pattern and the size of the resist pattern in the case where the size of the gate pattern is rendered larger than the size of the resist pattern (step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Then, a maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns in the allowable value of the etching conversion difference is obtained by using the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (step ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). It should be noted that, in the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the etching conversion difference changes in accordance with the change in the kind (e.g., the material) and the thickness of the film to be etched. Therefore, the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>also changes depending on the change in the kind and thickness of the film to be etched. For example, the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>in the case where the film to be etched is a polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) film is smaller than the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>in the case where the film to be etched is an insulating film. Also, the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>decreases with the increase in the thickness of the film to be etched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> After determination of the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>, distances X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>and X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns are determined for each layout by using two typical layouts shown in, for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> (step ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). To be more specific, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows the first layout. The first layout is the layout, covering the case where the distance between the adjacent gate patterns <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is relatively small and a dummy pattern is not present between the adjacent patterns <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this case, the adjacent gate patterns <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are arranged on element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>apart from each other by the distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>that is not larger than the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>. The distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent gate patterns is called later herein the G-G distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows the second layout. The second layout is the layout covering the case where the distance between the adjacent gate patterns is relatively large, and a dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is interposed between the adjacent gate patterns <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this case, the gate patterns <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are arranged on the element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>apart from each other by the distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D</subscript></highlight>, which is not larger than the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>, and the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is arranged on an element isolation region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Since the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed on the element isolation region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, it is possible to suppress the influence on the device characteristics even in the case of forming the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>between the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is called herein the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Concerning steps ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> described above, where, for example, the allowable value of the etching conversion difference is 10 nm, the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns is about 1.5 &mgr;m as apparent from the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Therefore, the G-G distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>or the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>is set at a value not larger than 1.5 &mgr;m. In this case, the width W<highlight><subscript>G </subscript></highlight>of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is about 0.15 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in order to miniaturize the element, it is desirable for the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns to be not larger than 5 &mgr;m. Also, in order to lower the etching conversion difference, it is desirable for the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns to be not larger than 10 times as the width W<highlight><subscript>G </subscript></highlight>of the gate pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As described above, where the distance between the adjacent patterns <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is relative long as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the design layout is prepared with the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> arranged in the design stage (step ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Then, the design data for the light exposure of a mask used for the pattern formation is converted on the basis of the design layout prepared in step ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> noted above (step ST<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, an inspection to check that the G-G distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>or the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>is not larger than the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns, an inspection to see whether the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be arranged, and an inspection to see whether the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is arranged on only the element isolation region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are performed by using a design rule checker (DRC) in the designing step, after completion of the designing step or in the design data conversion step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the next step, a metal film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with an insulating film (not shown) interposed therebetween, followed by coating the metal film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. Then, the mask pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is prepared above the resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by using the converted design data noted above (step ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). Further, the resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is patterned by photolithography by using the mask pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to form a resist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> (step ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the next step, the metal film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is selectively removed by etching using the resist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so as to form a gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>. In this case, a dummy pattern is also formed. However, the dummy pattern thus formed is removed after formation of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the pattern formation according to the first embodiment of the present invention described above is directed to the patterning of a gate. However, the first embodiment is not limited to the patterning of a gate. For example, the first embodiment of the present invention can also be applied to the patterning of, for example, a wiring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Also, electron beam lithography can also employed in place of photolithography for forming the resist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In this case, the resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is patterned without using a mask and by using the converted design data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the present invention described above, the design layout is prepared by determining the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns such that the etching conversion difference is rendered not larger than the allowable value so as to determine the G-G distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>or the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D</subscript></highlight>. What should be noted is that a pattern put in an isolated state by a design rule is eliminated by imparting a restriction to the design rule so as to prevent the situation that the etching conversion difference is made larger than the allowable value. It follows that it is possible to correct a change in the size of the isolated pattern derived from the etching process so as to make it possible to achieve a pattern formation with a higher dimensional accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Further, an inspection to check that the G-G distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>or the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>is not larger than the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns, an inspection to see whether the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be arranged, and an inspection to see whether the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is arranged on only the element isolation region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are applied to the data for the light exposure or the design data by using a design rule checker. As a result, it is possible to prepare a layout small in etching conversion difference on the element isolation region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that does not affect the device characteristics. It follows that it is possible to prevent the etching conversion difference from being made larger than the allowable value, e.g., 10 nm), so as to achieve pattern formation with a higher dimensional accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the example described above in conjunction with the first embodiment of the present invention covers the case where the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is arranged ideally. In actual pattern formation, however, many design restrictions are imposed. Therefore, it is desirable that the number of portions to which the particular design rule is applied to be as small as possible. To decrease the number of portions to which the design rule is applied as much as possible, the method described below is considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment of the present invention, the arrangement of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is intended to decrease the etching conversion difference so as to ensure a lithography margin required for finishing in a desired size after etching. It should be noted that, where the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is larger than the minimum processing size, the lithography margin is improved. Therefore, it is possible to make the design rule of the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>more moderate than the design rule referred to in conjunction with the first embodiment of the present invention in respect of a gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thicker than the minimum processing size. It should be noted that the degree of freedom of the design can be increased by determining the design rule of the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>in accordance with the width W<highlight><subscript>G </subscript></highlight>of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Further, in the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thicker than about twice the minimum processing size, it is possible to ensure a sufficient lithography margin compared with the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having the minimum processing size so as to make it unnecessary to apply the design rule. In other words, it suffices to arrange the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in accordance with the design rule described above in only the case where the width W<highlight><subscript>G </subscript></highlight>of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is smaller than twice the minimum processing size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, if the potential of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> arranged in the vicinity of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not fixed in this case, the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> forms a floating gate so as to tend to have a detrimental effect on the device characteristics. In order to avoid this detrimental effect, it is possible to arrange a contact <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and to connect the contact <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to a metal layer arranged above the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference>. As a result, it is possible to fix the gate potential of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> alone formed on the element region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is the gate required particularly for size control. It follows that it suffices to arrange the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> shown in the first embodiment of the present invention in only the region between the adjacent gate patterns <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> arranged on the element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> What should also be noted is that severe size control as required for the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not required for the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it suffices for the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to have a thickness large enough to prevent the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from falling down on the wafer. In other words, it suffices for the width W<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to be not smaller than the minimum width W<highlight><subscript>G </subscript></highlight>of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Also, it is possible for the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to have an optional pattern shape as far as the conditions described above are satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As described above, the methods described above make it possible to moderate to some extent the design restrictions described previously in conjunction with the first embodiment of the present invention so as to lessen the burden on by the designer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SECOND EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is highly laborious for the designer to arrange not only the main pattern required for the device but also the dummy pattern as in the first embodiment of the present invention described above. Therefore, it is conceivable to arrange the main pattern alone in the design stage and to arrange the dummy pattern in the stage of conversion of the data of the mask for the light exposure after completion of the design stage. In this case, however, it is impossible to set the design rule using the dummy pattern because the dummy pattern is not arranged in the finishing time of the design, unlike the first embodiment. To be more specific, it is impossible to define the design rule of the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>described previously in conjunction with the first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Under the circumstances, the design rule is set in the second embodiment of the present invention such that each of the G-G distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>and the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>is not rendered larger than the desired maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>even in this case. In other words, in the second embodiment of the present invention, the main pattern alone is arranged in the design stage, and the dummy pattern for lowering the etching conversion difference is arranged in the data conversion stage after completion of the design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the pattern forming method according to the second embodiment of the present invention. The pattern forming method according to the second embodiment will now be described according to the flowchart with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A, 8B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C. In describing the second embodiment, points similar to those of the first embodiment will be described briefly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> First of all, the allowable value of the etching conversion difference is determined as in the first embodiment (step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). Then, the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns is obtained for the allowable value of the etching conversion difference noted above (step ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), followed by determining a distance A between the adjacent element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(step ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Further, a distance B between the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the edge portion of the element region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is determined in accordance with the distance A between the adjacent element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>such that the distance B not above is not larger than a defined value. The defined value of the distance B is equal to the sum of the size of the contact <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the deviation amount of the alignment between the contact <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the deviation amount of the alignment between the contact <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diffusion layer within the element region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Where the distance A between the adjacent element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not smaller than the defined value, it is possible to arrange the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and, thus, it is possible to increase the distance B between the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the edge portion of the element region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. On the other hand, where the distance A between the adjacent element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not larger than the defined value, it is impossible to arrange the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and, thus, it is impossible to increase the distance B between the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the edge portion of the element region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Incidentally the defined value of the distance A is equal to the sum of the width W<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the deviation amount of alignment between the diffusion layer within the element region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As described above, a design layout can be prepared without actually arranging the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (step ST<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the next step, it is judged whether or not the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> should be arranged on the basis of the aspect as to whether the distance A between the adjacent element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not smaller than the defined value (step ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Where it has been found that the distance A between the adjacent element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not smaller than the defined value, i.e., where the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be arranged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, the width W<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is determined (step ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). To be more specific, a distance C between the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the element region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is set at a value not larger than the defined value, and the width W<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is obtained by subtracting a distance, which is double the distance C, from the distance A between the adjacent element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Incidentally, it is necessary to set the distance C such that the sum of the distance B and the distance C is not larger than the distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D</subscript></highlight>. Also, the defined value of the distance C is set equal to the deviation amount for the alignment between the diffusion layer within the element region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. After determination of the width W<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the data conversion of the mask is carried out in view of the design layout noted above and the width W<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (step ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, where the distance A between the adjacent element regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not larger than the defined value, i.e., where it is impossible to arrange the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, the data conversion of the mask is carried out on the basis of the design layout as described above (step ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the G-G distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>and the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D</subscript></highlight>, which are smaller than the desired maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>, are taken into consideration in performing the data conversion of the mask regardless of the presence or absence of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, an inspection to check that the G-G distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>or the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>is not larger than the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns and an inspection to see whether the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be arranged on the element isolation region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>alone are performed by using a design rule checker (DRC) in the designing step, after completion of the designing step or in the design data conversion step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> After conversion of the design data of the mask performed as described above, the pattern formation is carried out as in the first embodiment described previously (steps ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, it is possible to employ electron beam lithography in place of photolithography for forming the resist pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as in the first embodiment described previously. In this case, the resist layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is patterned by using the converted design data without using a mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment of the present invention described above, the design layout is prepared by determining the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns such that the etching conversion difference is rendered not larger than the allowable value, and the generation rule of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is defined after completion of the design. As a result, it is possible to suppress the G-G distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>or the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>to a level not larger than, for example, 1.5 &mgr;m, as in the first embodiment described previously, so as to make it possible to prevent the etching conversion difference from being made larger than the allowable value. As a result, it is possible to correct the change in the size of the isolated pattern derived from the etching process. It follows that it is possible to perform pattern formation with high dimensional accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Further, an inspection to check that the G-G distance X<highlight><subscript>G-G </subscript></highlight>or the G-D distance X<highlight><subscript>G-D </subscript></highlight>is not larger than the maximum distance X<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>between the adjacent patterns, e.g., not larger than 1.5 &mgr;m, and an inspection to see whether the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is arranged on only the element isolation region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are applied to the data for the light exposure or the design data by using a design rule checker. As a result, it is possible to prepare a layout small in etching conversion difference on the element isolation region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that does not affect the device characteristics. It follows that it is possible to prevent the etching conversion difference from being made larger than the allowable value, e.g., 10 nm), so as to achieve pattern formation with higher dimensional accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, it is possible for the second embodiment to have the construction described below, like the first embodiment described previously. For example, it is possible to arrange the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in accordance with the design rule described above in only the case where the width W<highlight><subscript>G </subscript></highlight>of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not larger than twice the minimum processing size. Also, it is possible to arrange the contact <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and to connect the contact <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the metal layer arranged above the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</cross-reference>. Further, it is possible to make the width W<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> larger than the minimum width W<highlight><subscript>G </subscript></highlight>of the gate pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Also, it is possible for the dummy pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to have any optional pattern shape as far as the conditions described above are satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the present invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein.
