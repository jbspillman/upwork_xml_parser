<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a control device for an automatic transmission for a vehicle, in particular, to the control device for the automatic transmission having a shift lock system which can securely avoid plural improper selective operations of a select lever by a single lock member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A conventional control device for an automatic transmission has a shift lock system which permits selective operations of a select lever from a parking position to other range positions only when a brake pedal is actuated for example, at starting time of an automobile. The shift lock system preferably avoids a selective operation from a neutral position to a reverse position while driving of the automobile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The shift lock system in the transmission control device usually has each lock member used in each case to restrict the selective operations by putting each lock member into operation at each predetermined operating condition in order to restrict the selective operations in the above two cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, operating two kinds of lock members at predetermined operation conditions requires many components to be used and leads to a complex shift lock system. Furthermore, assembly of the shift lock system needs considerable hours and costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> JP-A-8334167 discloses the control device for the automatic transmission having the shift lock system in which a single lock member avoids both selective operations from a parking position to other range positions and a selective operation from a neutral position to a reverse position at predetermined operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The control device, as schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, includes a select lever <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> rotatably supported on a housing <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and a gate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as an opening having a step-like configuration, the latter of which contains range positions for an automatic mode including a series of a parking position, a parking release position, a reverse position, a reverse preparing position and a neutral position. This gate type transmission control system performing the selective operations of the select lever <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> by engaging the select lever <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> with any of the range positions of the gate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, is provided with an engaging projection <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> on one side of the select lever <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and a single lock member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> rotatably supported on the housing <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through a rotary shaft <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. The lock member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> rotates around the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> with the aid of an electric solenoid <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to obtain either a working position (shown in solid lines) for avoiding the selective operation from the parking position to the parking release position and the selective operation from the neutral position to the reverse preparing position by contacting a head end surface of the engaging projection <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> or a nonworking position (shown in imaginary lines) for avoiding contact therewith at predetermined operational conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the above mentioned transmission control device disclosed in JP-A-8334167, both the selective operations of the select lever <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> from the parking position to other range positions and the selective operation from the neutral position to the reverse position are effectively restricted by rotating the lock member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to have the working position. The above selective operations are permitted by rotating the lock member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to have the nonworking position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The lock member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, however, has a substantial length and a large space for the shift lock system, because the single lock member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> supported on the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> has to be operated for avoiding both the selective operations from the parking position to the parking release position and from the neutral position to the reverse preparing position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the improper selective operations of the select lever <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> from the parking position to the parking release position and from the neutral position to the reverse preparing position, some stress from the lock member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to the engaging projection <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> acts on the contacting region of the lock member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in a direction substantially perpendicular to the extended direction of the lock member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Significant large stress hence acts on both the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> for supporting the lock members <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the supporting region thereof in the housing <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. This large stress leads to frictional wear of the supporting region and consequently a short time durability of the transmission control device. Therefore, a corrective measure, for example, supporting the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> on both sides of the housing <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, may be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Supporting the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> on both sides of the housing <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> increases the amount of space occupied by the shift lock system and the size of the transmission control device itself, thus, the weight of the transmission control device and the cost of manufacture as well. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a control device for an automatic transmission having a shift lock system which securely prohibits plural improper selective operations of a select lever by a lock member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is other object of the present invention to provide the control device for the automatic transmission with a durable shift lock system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is further object of the present invention to provide the control device for the automatic transmission having the shift lock system of very small size, and which is very light in weight and a low cost to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide the control device for the automatic transmission having the shift lock system which consumes only a little amount of electric power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The above objects are achieved by the automatic transmission control device for the vehicle comprising: a housing for including the transmission control device; a first rotary shaft supported on the housing and extended in a substantially widthwise direction of a vehicle body; a lock plate with a guide opening containing range positions for an automatic transition mode including a series of a parking position, a reverse position, a neutral position and a driving position; a select lever supported on the first rotary shaft and being rotatable for selecting one of the range positions; a guide pin supported on the select lever, an end of the guide pin for defining a selective operation of the select lever accepted in the guide opening so as to engage with any of the range positions; and a specific shift lock system for prohibiting the selective operation of the select lever. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The shift lock system in the transmission control device comprises a lock pin extending substantially in parallel with the first rotary shaft, the lock pin being movable in a lengthwise direction of the vehicle body with response to a rotation of the select lever; a second rotary shaft supported on the housing and extended substantially in parallel with the first rotary shaft; and a lock member having a lock part supported on the second rotary shaft so as to rotate around the second rotary shaft to have one of a lock position and an unlock position, the lock position for prohibiting the selective operation of the select lever by bringing the lock part into a contact with a periphery of the lock pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The above object are also achieved by the automatic transmission control device for the vehicle comprising: a housing for including the control device; a first rotary shaft supported on the housing and extended in a substantially widthwise direction of an vehicle body; a third rotary shaft extended substantially perpendicularly to a longitudinal direction of the first rotary shaft; a select lever being rotatable around both the first rotary shaft and the third rotary shaft for selecting one of range positions for an automatic transmission mode; a gate provided in the housing containing the range positions including a series of a parking position, a reverse position, a neutral position and a driving position for defining the selective operation of the select lever; and the above specific shift lock system for prohibiting the selective operation of the select lever. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The shift lock system according to the present invention is arranged such that the lock part of the lock member enters into a movement track of the lock pin and locks the lock pin by contacting the periphery when an improper selective operation of the select lever is attempted to be carry out, and such that the lock part moves away from the movement track of the lock pin and releases the lock pin by avoiding the contact when an selective operation is acceptable. According to the present invention, the improper selective operations are securely prohibited by the single lock member. Furthermore, rotating of the lock member on the second rotary shaft provides a small lock member, a compact shit lock system and a transmission control system of very small size which is very light in weight and inexpensive to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the improper selective operations of the select lever, some stress from the periphery of the lock pin to the engaging region of the lock part acts on both the rotary shaft part and a supporting region thereof in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the second rotary shaft. As a result, unbalanced stress on the second rotary shaft and the supporting region are significantly reduced. Therefore, the requirement to the stiffness and wear resistance of these parts decreases, and simple structures of the parts can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is possible to prohibit plural selective operations, such as the selective operation from the parking position to the reverse position, from the neutral position to the reverse position, and from the reverse position to the other positions, by changing a shape of the lock part of the lock member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible to prohibit an improper selective operation in an advantageous condition by placing the lock pin on a lock pin bracket which moves around the first rotary shaft together with the select lever. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the driving means can be easily structured by an electric solenoid for rotating the lock member from the lock position to the unlock position. The solenoid is preferably arranged to operate only when a brake pedal is actuated. In this manner, it is possible to decrease the amount of electric power consumed by the solenoid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Further aspects of the present invention will be clearly understood from the claims, the drawings and the written descriptions.</paragraph>

The detent system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for maintaining the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> stepwise is also provided in this embodiment. Further detail is not described because further details are not important to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> At a side <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the lower housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, there is provided a shift lock system <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> for prohibiting the selective operation of the selector lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> A shift lock system <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> comprises the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> placed on a lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, an electric solenoid <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a link member <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, and a lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as the main components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is supported at a lower part thereof on the first rotary shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and has a substantially L-shape consisted of a lateral part and an upper part. The lateral part is connected to one end of the base part <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the joining member <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and extended upwardly along the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The upper part is formed by bending at the top end of the lateral part and extends substantially in parallel with the first rotary shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a slit for accepting the select lever<highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and for permitting the movement of the select lever <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is provided in the upper part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a sub bracket <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> is provided for enforcing the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. The sub bracket <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> is supported at a bottom end thereof on the first rotary shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and is connected at a top end thereof to the lateral part of the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> An annular cushion <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> is provided at the periphery of the slit for decreasing looseness of the lever body <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and the noise caused by the contact with the lever body <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and the slit <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can rotate in the widthwise direction of the vehicle by the slit <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> without the interference of the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. When the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> moves forwardly, the lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> pushes the front part of the slit <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> forwardly and rotates the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> forwardly. When the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> moves backwardly, the lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> pushes the rear part of the slit <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> backwardly and rotates the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> backwardly. The rotation of the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is prohibited by bringing the select lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into contact with the front or rear part through the cushion <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>. In other wards, the select lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is arranged to move around the first rotary shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> together with the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is placed in the vicinity of the upper end of the lateral part of the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> extending substantially in parallel with the first rotary shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and projecting in the opposite direction with respect to the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> moves around the first rotary shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to have one of the range positions in conjunction with the movement of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the corresponding range position. On the other hand, the movement of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> around the first rotary shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is prohibited by prohibiting the movement of the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> through the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. As a result, the selective operation of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is prohibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Further description as to the electric solenoid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the link member <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the control unit for the shift lock system<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is omitted, because these parts are almost the same as those used in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The operation of the above described control device will be explained particularly with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Suppose that the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has the P position, the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is fixed to the P position by the gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the detent system, and the cable mounting arm <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> connected to the first rotary shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> also maintains the P position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the shift lock system <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> maintains the P/N lock position, in which the lock part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is located between the position to be occupied by the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in the P position and the position to be occupied by the pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in the N position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> When the ignition switch <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is inoperative, or when only the ignition switch <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is actuated and the brake pedal <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is not actuated, the electric solenoid <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is not operated. As the result, the lock member <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> maintains the P/N position. In this case, the selective operation of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the other range positions is prohibited because the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can not move backwardly by the contact of the periphery of the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> with the first engaging surface <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the lock part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, though the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can move in the left. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> When both the ignition switch <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and the brake pedal <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are actuated and the vehicle is driven at a slower speed than the predetermined speed, the actuating rod <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is retracted by a predetermined length by the operation of the electric solenoid <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> moves around the rotary shaft part <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> supported on the side <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> together with the link member <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> integrally connected thereto. As the result, the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has the unlock position, in which the contact of the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the lock part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is avoided as shown by the imaginary lines <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Therefore, the selective lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can move backwardly and the selective operations of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the other range positions are permitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> During driving forwardly of the vehicle, when the brake pedal <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is inoperative, the lock member maintains the P/N lock position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> by the inoperative electric solenoid <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. In this case, the improper selective operation of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the N position or to the R position is prohibited, because the second engaging surface <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the lock part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> engages with the periphery of the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> When the brake pedal <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is actuated, the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> moves to have the P/N lock position shown by the imaginary lines <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> by the operation of the electric solenoid <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The selective operation of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is permitted because the contact of the periphery of the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> with the second engaging surface <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the vehicle is driven forwardly at the predetermined speed or more, the electric solenoid <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is not turned on, even if the brake pedal <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is actuated. As the result, the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> maintains the P/N lock position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In this case, the selective operation of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the N position to the R position or the P position is prohibited because the second engaging part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the lock part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> engages with the periphery of the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the improper selective operation from the N position to the R position during forward driving of the vehicle is securely prohibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> For the reverse operation of the vehicle, the selective operation of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the P position or the N position to R position is carried out when the brake pedal <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is actuated. When the operation of the brake pedal <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> ceases, the electric solenoid <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is turned off, and the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> moves to have the P/N lock position shown by the solid lines. Accompanied with the movement of the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the PIN lock position, the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is fixed in the R lock position, in which the third engaging surface <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the lock part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> engages with the periphery of the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in the R position. Therefore, the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> maintains the R position. At this time, the selective operation of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the R position to the P position or the N position is prohibited because the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is fixed by the third engaging surface <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the lock part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. When the vehicle is driven at a slower speed than the predetermined speed and the brake pedal <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is actuated, the electric solenoid <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is turned on. At this time, the selective operation to the P position or the N position is permitted because the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> moves to the unlock position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> When the vehicle is driven in the reverse direction at the predetermined speed or more, however, the electric solenoid <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is not operated, even if the brake pedal <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is actuated. As the result, the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> maintains the R lock position shown in the solid lines of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In this position, the selective operation of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to any of the other range positions is prohibited because the third engaging part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the lock part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> engages with the periphery of the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the improper selective operation from the R position to any of the other range positions during driving in the reverse direction of the vehicle is securely prohibited </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In this gate type transmission control system, like the first embodiment, the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is supported on the lower housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can move to have one of the lock position and the unlock position, and the improper selective operation of the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is prohibited by bringing the lock part <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> into contact with the periphery of the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> placed on the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> which moves around together with the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the stress from the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> to the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at the improper selective operation affects on the rotary shaft part (the second rotary shaft) <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the supporting part thereof (for example, the engaging opening <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the rotary shaft part <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. As the result, the unbalanced stress does not act on the parts. Therefore, the requirement to the stiffness of the parts decreases, and to a simplification of the supporting parts is provided. Furthermore, the wear resistance of the rotary shaft part <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the supporting part thereof increases, and the durable shift lock system is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> can easily rotate together with the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by placing the lock pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> on the lock pin bracket <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> which moves around the first rotary shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> together with the select lever <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the prohibition of the improper selective operation is performed in optimum conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The embodiment may include the lock members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> described for the second or the third embodiment in order to obtain the shift lock system having such functions as those in the second or the third embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. For an example, contrary to the above embodiments, the second rotary shaft <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> may be integral with the lock member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the link shaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be integral with the link member <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modification as would be understood to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
