<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to keyboards and more particularly to keyboards which are illuminated by light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Keyboards, such as those that are used in conjunction with computers, have been known in the past to be illuminated for facilitating their use in low light conditions. Such prior art illuminated keyboards, however, have suffered from several different disadvantages. One such disadvantage is the excessive consumption of electrical power. Another disadvantage involves the lack of control over the illumination of the keyboard. Furthermore, prior art illuminated keyboards have often been constructed of relatively expensive components. The desirability of an illuminated keyboard that overcomes these and other disadvantages can therefore be seen. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides an illuminated keyboard that overcomes these and other disadvantages. A keyboard according to one aspect of the present invention includes at least one translucent, depressible key. A first light is included and is sized and positioned to illuminate substantially the entirety of the at least one key when the first light is illuminated. A second light is also provided and is sized and positioned to illuminate less of the at least one key than the first light when the second light is illuminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, an illuminated keyboard is provided which includes a plurality of translucent, depressible keys. A plurality of large, lights are also provided. Each of the large lights are sufficiently sized to illuminate substantially an entire one of the plurality of keys. A plurality of small lights are also provided. Each of the small lights are sized to illuminate only a portion of one of the plurality of keys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to still other aspects of the present invention the lights may be electroluminescent lights, or other types of lights, such as light-emitting diodes (LED&apos;s), white LED&apos;s, fiber optic lights, or other types of lights. A controller may be provided for selectively illuminating the different lights independently from each other. The keyboard may include one or more triacs which are controlled by the controller and allow current to flow to the lights in a controllable manner. The lights of the present invention may also be positioned on top of a circuit board that outputs an electrical signal when one or more of the keys are pressed. The controller may further be adapted to selectively alter the frequency of electrical power to the lights, and/or to selectively alter the brightness by which the lights are illuminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a keyboard that uses less electrical power than various prior art illuminated keyboards. The keyboard can be controlled by a computer or other electronic device in a variety of different manners. The brightness, color, and/or individual lights that are illuminated can be dictated by the computer or other control device. These and other benefits of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art in light of the following specification when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals correspond to like elements in the several drawings. An illuminable keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to one aspect of the present invention is depicted in block diagram form in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Illuminable keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a plurality of depressible keys <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, keys <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are arranged on frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner that is commonly used in conjunction with a computer. Specifically, keys <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> include individual keys for all the letters of the alphabet, the numerals <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, various character keys, and a plurality of function keys. It will of course be understood by those skilled in the art that illuminable keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can take on a variety of different forms from that depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For example, illuminable keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include only a number pad, or some other subset of the total keys <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Keyboards with additional keys are also contemplated within the scope of the present invention. Further, illuminable keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> finds application in keyboards other than those used for controlling a computer, such as touch pad screens on telephones, calculators, and any other type of device having keys which are desirably illuminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Each of keys <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are preferably made from a translucent material to thereby allow light underneath the key to pass through the individual key. As will be described in more detail below, at least one light is positioned underneath each key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The light may be made of electroluminescent material, or constructed in another manner. For purposes of illustration only, the invention will hereinafter be described using electroluminescent lights, although it will be understood that the invention finds equal application to other types of lights. The illumination of these lights is controlled by a controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> depicted in block diagram form in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> includes a communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, an electroluminescent light driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a power supply <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a plurality of triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and suitable wiring or other conductors for allowing each of these components to operate and interact with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a computer interface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which may be a standard computer interface, such as the IBM AT or PS2 keyboard interface. Any other types of interfaces that allow communication between keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a computer can be used within the scope of the present invention. For example, processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is also attached to a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port for allowing a device attached via a USB connection to communicate with communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and thereby control the illumination of the keys <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is responsible for controlling the communications between keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an attached computer or other device. In the illustrated embodiment, communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes sixteen column inputs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and eight row inputs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These inputs indicate to communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> when a particular key on keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pressed. Each key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled, when pressed, to a unique combination of columns and rows. When a particular key is pressed, an electrical circuit is completed through a particular column and particular row. Communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is able to determine which individual key or keys have been pressed by analyzing column and row inputs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The manner in which communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> determines which key or keys have been pressed can be accomplished in a known manner. Communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> further includes, in the illustrated embodiment, three light outputs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for selectively illuminating the standard lights that appear on the keyboard when the number lock, caps lock, or scroll lock keys are pressed. The lighting of these keys is also accomplished in a known manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is also in communication with lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> controls the illumination of the individual keys, or portions of keys, that are to be illuminated by the underlying electroluminescent lights. Based on commands received from a computer, communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> tells lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which particular key or portion of a key should be illuminated. Communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> further indicates to lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> the level of brightness by which the individual key or portion of a key should be illuminated. Further, communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may also indicate to lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> the particular frequency of the AC signal by which the individual electroluminescent light should be powered. By supplying power to the individual electroluminescent lights at varying frequencies, the color of the illumination of the electroluminescent light can be varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is coupled to a plurality of triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by a plurality of column lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and row lines <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Each of the individual column lines feed into one of the eight triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> while each of the column lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> feed into one of the sixteen individual row triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In particular, column and row lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> each feed into the gate input of the respective triac. When the gate input is activated, the particular triac <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allows AC current to flow between its two main terminals. One of the main terminals of each of the triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to the electroluminescent light driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by way of a power line <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The other main terminal of each of the triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to a plurality of individual electroluminescent lights within keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Specifically, each main terminal of the row triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to sixteen different electroluminescent lights. Conversely, each of the column triacs is connected to up to eight separate electroluminescent lights. By activating the gate of one of the row triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the gate of one of the column triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, an individual electroluminescent light on keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be illuminated. If only one triac <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is activated, and not a pair of triacs, no electroluminescent lights will be illuminated as a complete circuit is not formed between light driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and any particular electroluminescent light. Thus, by choosing which particular row triacs to activate and which particular column triac to activate (i.e., a unique row-column address), the illumination of any individual key can be controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may also be programmed to control the frequency of the power that is supplied to each electroluminescent light through lamp driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The selected frequency is based on a command received from communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. By varying the frequency of the power supplied to the electroluminescent lights, it is possible to alter the color of the light emitted from some electroluminescent lights. An attached computer may therefore send a command to communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> indicating which key or keys should be illuminated and in which color. Communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> converts this command to an appropriate lower level communication to lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to thereby select the appropriate frequency of the power to be supplied to a particular light. In one embodiment, lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> only illuminates one individual key at a time. The duration of the lighting of each key is a small fraction of a second. After an individual light has been lit for this fraction of a second, the next light on keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is to be illuminated is lit up for a fraction of a second. And after that one is turned off, the next one is lit up for a fraction of a second. By this method of scanning through the keys and illuminating the appropriate areas for a non-overlapping fraction of a second, it is possible to power each individual key with power of a unique frequency. Thus, the color of each key can be controlled independently of the color of the other keys. In this manner it is also possible to control the brightness of each individual illuminated key independently from other keys by adjusting the power supplied by driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the appropriate times. Preferably, the scanning illumination of individual keys is sufficiently fast to avoid any visually-apparent flickering of the illuminated lights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Electroluminescent light driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives inputs from lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and power supply <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Power supply <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provides a DC voltage, such as 5 volts, to electroluminescent light driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Light driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> converts this DC voltage into an AC voltage, which is necessary to illuminate the electroluminescent lights on keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, light driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> converts the 5 volt input from power supply <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into a 140 volt AC output at a frequency of approximately 400 hertz. If desired, light driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can vary the frequency of the output power based upon instructions from lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> While other types of components can be used within the scope of the present invention, communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is, in the illustrated embodiment, a processor manufactured by Microchip Technology, Inc. of Chandler, Ariz. having part number PIC16C765. Also in the illustrated embodiment, lamp processor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is a processor manufactured by Microchip Technology, Inc. bearing the part number PIC16C74. Electroluminescent light driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in the illustrated embodiment, is any one of a family of lamp drivers manufactured by Sipex Corporation of Billerica, Mass. having part number SP44xx, where the latter two x&apos;s indicate variable part numbers. Power supply <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be any conventional power supply which receives power from a power input. The power input may be separate from the computer input into communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, or the two may be combined together into a single cord. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A sectional view of an individual key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, along with a portion of keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is depicted in exploded view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is preferably translucent, may be manufactured in any standard form. Key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is mounted to a flexible spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by way of a sleeve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in a known manner. Flexible spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is made from a rubbery type of material that resiliently biases key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a non-depressed position. An electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is positioned under flexible spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is positioned on top of a circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are encased within a lamination <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A base plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is positioned underneath the lamination layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and provides rigidity and structural support to keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, lamination <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and base plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are surrounded by an upper half <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a lower half <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which are secured together during the final assembly of keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. While electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as having a length generally equal to that of an individual key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, it will be understood that electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, in the preferred embodiment, is part of a single layer of material having an area approximately equal to the total area of all the keys which are to be illuminated. Onto this single layer are deposited multiple, discrete electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, only one of which is pictured in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Such depositing of the lights and the electrical conductors can be accomplished in a known manner. While other types of lights can be used, the electroluminescent lights of the present invention are preferably manufactured by MetroMark, Inc. of Minnetonka, Minn., and are deposited onto a substrate or layer in the desired shapes. The individual electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are positioned beneath each of the keys <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> generally has an area equal to the area of the total number of keys <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> serves to determine when an individual key or keys are pressed and sends signals indicating the pressing of one or more keys to communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> therefore extends underneath all of the keys <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Lamination <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> surrounds the entire circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as well as the entire layer on which electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are incorporated. Lamination <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> forms a watertight seal around electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to thereby allow keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be immersed in water without losing functionality. Only a single wire needs to extend from the inside of lamination <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the outside and such a single wire can be adhered to the lamination in a known manner to create the waterproofing of the keyboard. The layer of the electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes electrical contacts mounted on its underside underneath each key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (not shown). When an individual key is pressed, flexible spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> collapses and pushes against the underlying electroluminescent light. The contact on the underside of electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is then pushed into contact with circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, thereby providing the indication that the individual key has been pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a plan view of a plurality of electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In this particular illustration, the lamps are arranged in a pattern that might underlie a typical number pad on a computer keyboard. The electroluminescent lights depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> include large electroluminescent lamps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and small electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The large electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are generally dimensioned with an area substantially equal to the area of the key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which resides above the light. The small electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, on the other hand, have an area substantially smaller than the area of the large electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that surrounds them. The purpose of small electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is to illuminate only a portion of the individual key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. While the precise portion can be any desired portion within the scope of the invention, one use of small electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is to illuminate the individual indicia printed on the key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thus, if a particular key includes the number &ldquo;1&rdquo; printed on the key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, small electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be dimensioned generally of the same size as the number <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> printed on key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In such an embodiment, the large lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illuminate the entire key while the small lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illuminate only the particular indicia that is affixed to the top surface of the key. Each large and small electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes a pair of power leads <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (only one illustrated) which supply power for illuminating a respective electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Power leads <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are coupled to one of the terminals of each of triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when a particular combination of a row and column triac <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is activated, an individual electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is illuminated. The particular light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that is illuminated may either be a large light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or a small light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The keyboard illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes more than 100 keys. With eight rows of triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and sixteen columns of triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, there are 128 possible individual electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that can be illuminated. These individual lights could be arranged such that a single light is positioned behind each individual key. Alternatively, there may be two or more lights, preferably of different sizes, positioned behind one or more of the keys. Because there are only controls for 128 individual lights depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is not possible to provide each individual key in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with both a large and small electroluminescent light <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. If it were desirable to have both a large and small electroluminescent <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with each individual key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, additional rows or columns of triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> could be added to the keyboard illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a sectional view of a second embodiment of a portion of a keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The components of keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; that are the same or similar to keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are labeled with the same numbers followed by a prime symbol. Illuminable keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; includes a frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; having an upper half <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; and a lower half <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime;. A key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; is attached to a sleeve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; which is welded on a flexible spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime;. A circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime; is positioned under flexible spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and surrounded by a lamination <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>&prime;. A base plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&prime; is positioned underneath the laminated circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime;. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, at least a portion of the body of key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; is manufactured from electroluminescent material. While the portion may include just a top portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, it is also contemplated that the electroluminescent material may be part of a side <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;. Whatever the extent of the electroluminescent material, it may be desirable to include an exterior protective layer on top of the electroluminescent material to protect the electroluminescent material against wear and degradation. Such a protective layer is preferably translucent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the electroluminescent material is isolated into two discreet sections to thereby define two separate electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime;. One of the electroluminescent lights receives power by a first set of power lines <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> while the other electroluminescent light receives power via a second set of power lines <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. First and second sets of power lines <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are incorporated into sleeve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; and are electrically coupled to upper half <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; of frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime;. The power lines are then attached to triacs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, or other suitable switching mechanisms, for selectively illuminating the individual electroluminescent lights <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime;. While key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;, sleeve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime;, and upper half <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; of frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; are depicted as separated from each other in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, this separation is the result of the exploded nature of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and is only present for purposes of illustration. In the actual physical embodiment key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; is both physically and electrically coupled to sleeve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; which, in turn, is both physically and electrically coupled to the upper half of frame <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime;. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an electrical contact (not shown) is positioned underneath flexible spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; and comes into contact with circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime; when key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; is pressed. This electrical contact enables circuit board <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime; to send a signal to communications processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; indicating that the particular key has been pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An example of a cable system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> used in accordance with the keyboards of the present invention is depicted in a diagram format in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. When keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is to be used with a computer having a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, a cable <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> having two USB ports can be plugged directly into keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at one end and a computer at its other end. Because USB cables supply sufficient power to illuminate keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, no further cabling is required in such a situation. However, if keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is to be used with a computer having either an AT or PS/2 connection for the keyboard, such connections may not allow sufficient power to be delivered to keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to illuminate the keyboard. In such a case, a power cable <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is provided. Power cable <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> includes an AC/DC power adapter <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> that converts the <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>V AC power coming from a standard wall power outlet into a 12 volt DC signal which is used by keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Power cable <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> further includes a power connector <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> which is adapted to fit between a computer power supply <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and a cord <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which connects power supply <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to a wall or other power outlet. Connector <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> thus includes a plug for plugging it into one end of power supply <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and a port for receiving one end of cord <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. At an end opposite connector <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, power cable <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> includes a USB/AT connector <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, power cable can include a USB/PS/2 connector for PS/2 applications. Connector <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> includes a USB plug on one side for inserting directly into keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and either an AT or PS/2 port on its other side for receiving either an AT or PS/2 cable from the computer itself. Power cable <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> thus allows keyboard <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be used with computers having AT or PS/2 keyboard connections. </paragraph>
