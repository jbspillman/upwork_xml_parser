<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A conventional water filter generally includes a core which is made of active carbon, foam material, ultra-violet lamp or ceramic, and a casing which encloses the core. An end cap is connected to the casing so as to retain the core in the casing. Water may enter through the wall of the casing and the core to be filtered and the filtered water comes out from an outlet defined in the end cap. Another type of the water filter has two end caps and the casing is made of plastic or metal. An inlet and an outlet are respectively defined in the two end caps so that water enters in the casing via the inlet and the filtered water comes out from the outlet. However, none of the conventional water filters has proper device to allow the user to make sure that the water filter that he or she purchased is a genuine one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention intends to provide a water filter that has a removable member which is rotated before the filter is used and several connection plates are connected between the removable member and the filter so that the users can tell the status of the filter by checking the connection plates. </paragraph>
