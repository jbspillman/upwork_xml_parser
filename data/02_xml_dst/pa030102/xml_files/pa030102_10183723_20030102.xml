<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 2. Field of Use </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The field of use for the hypodermic implant device described in this specification is for injecting implants into living or non-living organisms or things, such as inanimate articles and materials. Most often the implant device will be used for injecting an implant into subcutaneous tissues and blood vessels. The implant may be used for tracking and treatment of humans, animals, and plants. For purposes and illustration of an embodiment of the invention claimed in this specification, an application for the treatment of humans and animals will be described in the &ldquo;Summary of an Embodiment of the Invention,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Brief Description Of The Drawings&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;Detailed Description And Operation Of The Invention&rdquo; sections of this specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 3. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Hypodermic implant devices are on the market today. They are used in clinical, surgical, and outdoor settings. However, the currently marketed hypodermic implant devices suffer from several shortcomings. Their extended needle poses a hazard of accidental needle sticks to the caregiver, the patient, and researchers. These devices do not have a nearly fail-safe method of self-destruction after use, thereby allowing possible reuse and the concomitant transmission of disease. Disposal of available implant device also poses risk of accidental needle sticks due to the extension of the islet or needle portion of the used implant device. The exposed islet also necessitates the use of special disposal containers for sharp contaminated articles. Furthermore, currently available hypodermic implant devices rarely feature a safety mechanism for locking the implant device to prevent accidentally expelling the implant. The invention described in this specification solves these needs. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> With the proliferation of many blood borne contagious diseases, such as AIDS and Ebola, the frequent use of hypodermic implant devices poses a serious risk of infection. Many times, it is not possible to determine for an extended period of time whether a caregiver or researcher has been infected as a result of a needle sticks. The result can be actual infection with a sometimes-lethal blood borne pathogen or a prolonged period of anguish and worry only to discover that the user is not infected. Use of hypodermic implant devices pose significant risks in the everyday clinical practice of medicine, whether the patient be a human or some other specie of animal, and in the outdoor implantation of animals for research, tracking, or identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It-has long been recognized that the needle stick risk factor needs to be controlled. Training and care while using hypodermic implant needles is emphasized. But, this, in of itself, is not enough, considering the high probability of a needle stick and the disastrous level of damage to health that it can inflict upon both the patient and caregiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is common practice in the health care or research industry to use a hypodermic implant device only once and then to dispose of it in a safe manner. However, currently marketed implant devices are not designed to self-destruct after a single use, thereby posing a risk of multiple uses. The hypodermic implant device of the present invention is designed so that it can be used once, only. Retraction of the piston of the device of the present invention results in retraction of the needle through and out of the luer fitting on the distal end of the barrel. The nozzle end of the needle then drops into a needle receptacle at the distal end of the barrel of the implant device making it virtually impossible to extend the needle outside the barrel. With the needle tilted into the distal end of the receptacle, the needle is simultaneously disabled from further use and safely disposed of; thereby avoiding transmission of infections by accidental needle sticks. Furthermore, in the clinic, hospital, veterinarian office, and farm or other field settings, the disposal of the implant device is much safer and may require a less costly disposal method than the currently used method of sharps disposal. The present invention features a normally retracted needle. This alone reduces risk of accidental needle sticks, since the needle is not exposed until it is actually ready to be injected into the target&apos;s tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention also features a locking mechanism that prevents the needle from accidental extension beyond the barrel of the implant device. Extension of the needle requires the user to deliberately depress a tab-like lock, which is integrally molded into the piston. Depression of the lock into a lock space in the piston allows the lock to clear the inside diameter of the barrel, the piston to travel in axial alignment with and into the barrel, and extension of the needle beyond the distal end of the barrel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This &ldquo;Summary of an Embodiment Of The Invention&rdquo; section describes the invention configured for implantation into humans and animals for purposes of illustration. It is to be understood that this invention may be used for myriad other applications.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference> show the basic structure, assembly, and mode of operation of hypodermic implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates the initial state of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when delivered, for example, in a sterile package to the user of implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Hypodermic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is comprised of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are in axial alignment with one another along central axis <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is split into two segments: upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be a stainless steel 300 Series, but any needle having a nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and an inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be suitable, depending upon the application. Piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is locked in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by locks <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Locks <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, are integrally molded into and is a part of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Locks <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are connected to upper and lower piston segments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by tabs <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are plastic molded elements, using conventional plastic molding techniques. The types of plastics suitable for the implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are, for example, polycarbonate and polypropylene. These plastics are commercially available and currently used in the manufacture of hypodermic implant devices. These types of materials are sufficiently impact resistance to withstand the normally encountered forces and usage without sustaining damage. Substitute materials are also readily available for manufacture of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for use in especially demanding environments, such as the research laboratory, outdoors, or in conjunction with injecting lubricants, adhesives, and other solids. When lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is in its normal molded position, it is raised above the outside diameter of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the inside diameter of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this position, the distal end of lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> engages with the proximal end of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, at the junction with barrel grip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, to prevent piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from sliding into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by an axial force on piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the direction of the distal end of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The term distal is used to refer to needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> end of hypodermic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The term proximal is used to refer to the other end of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Tab <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is of a thickness that allows lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be relatively easily depressed by the user&apos;s finger when using implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, yet thick enough that it will not be accidentally depressed during normal shipping, handling, and manipulation of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In other words, it is of a thickness that requires a conscious effort to depress. Upon depression, lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> moves into lock depression space <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Space <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is of sufficient depth that when lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fully depressed it seats in space <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the upper surface of lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at or below the outside diameter of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to slide into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> upon application of a distally directed force on the piston. Since lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is molded in the normally up position, i. e., at least the distal end of lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is extended beyond the outside diameter of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it has memory that returns it to the normally up position when any downward force on lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is relieved. The downward force is relieved when the user&apos;s finger pressure ceases or when piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pulled in a proximal direction relative to barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the point where the distal end of lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> extends beyond the inner wall of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby once again locking piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so it cannot be extended into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> without further downward pressure on lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The surface of lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> adjacent the outer wall of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is curved on the same radius as the outer wall of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is the same radius as the inner wall of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This allows for smooth travel of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> locking feature prevents accidental extension of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. If needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is accidentally extended, it may be exposed to harmful pathogens or other substances and be damaged by blunting, bending, or scraping forces occurring in the working environment. More importantly, the exposure of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, except when it must be extended for injection of an implant, increases the possibility of an accidental needle stick. Upon the occurrence of a needle stick, it is often not possible to determine whether an infectious substance was on needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The resulting uncertainty, and in the case of AIDS months or years of waiting, whether the person experiencing the needle stick has become infected, is often the cause of untold anguish and disruption of the care giver&apos;s career. And, of course, the consequences of actual infection are often fatal and seriously life compromising during the period of sickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Upper and lower piston grip segments <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provide an ergonomic thumb seat <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for the user&apos;s thumb to rest during movement of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The dotted line drawn on piston grip <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is the depression, which forms the thumb seat <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Circumferentially placed around the outside periphery of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are four longitudinal ribs <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Ribs <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> provide structural strength to piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Ribs <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> allow piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be molded using less material than would be used if piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> diameter were substantially equal to the inside diameter of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> completely around the piston&apos;s entire circumference and along the piston&apos;s entire length. Additionally, the added friction between the surface of the outside diameter of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the inside diameter of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, would require greater force to be applied to piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to move piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> distally into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. With only ribs <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> providing contact with the inside surface of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, less force is required for movement of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Barrel grip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provides the user with a means to grip barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when depressing upper or lower piston segments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The user&apos;s fingers grip the distal side of barrel grip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the thumb depresses the respective upper or lower piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Piston rings <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provide for circumferential support for piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> within barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The periphery of upper faceplate segment <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and lower faceplate segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also function to provide circumferential support. The additional support and the added friction assists with the smooth and tight fitting movement of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> within barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Since each piston ring <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is relatively narrow, the added friction is not great enough to require excessive force by the user to extend piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A gasket between needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the interface between piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not needed for the hypodermic implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, since there are no fluids in the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as in a hypodermic injection device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> supports the proximal end of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> within barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Bonding material <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> bonds needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> into support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is positioned relative to upper face plate segment <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by pre-load spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, one end of which is seated in support plate spring seat <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the other end seated in upper face plate segment spring seat <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed in the distal interior end of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The distal end of needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> terminates in luer sleeve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the proximal end terminates in the combination of support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and upper and lower faceplate segments <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Luer needle guide <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> supports the distal end of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>.

Support plate plug <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> mates with support plate plug cavity <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> when upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is in its most distal position. Support plate plug cavity <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> comprises support plate guide way <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and support plate needle pilot <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> both of which axially connect to form support plate plug cavity <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

End cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may either be friction fitted or bonded into end cap cavity <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. End cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be made of the same material as which the hypodermic implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are made or other suitable material that will allow end cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to nonreleasably fit into end cap cavity <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. End cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> fixedly retains seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be made of the same or similar material as a septum used on a vial of an injectable drug. The septum of a drug vial allows the needle of a hypodermic injection device to be inserted through it for the purpose of withdrawing the medical fluid in the vial up into the injection device. Upon removal of all or a portion of the fluid from the vial, the septum seals itself, thereby maintaining the fluid safe from the environment and exposure to contamination. In implant injection device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is a barrier that maintains needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> free from contaminants while they are in needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. But, it is a barrier that is easily penetrated by needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the user extends upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in a distal direction to fully extend needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is usually a silicone rubber material. </paragraph>

End cap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provisioned with end cap needle pilot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for guiding needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> into end cap needle guide <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The combination of support plate plug cavity <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, support plate plug cavity <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, needle pilot <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, leur needle guide <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> after perforation by extension of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, end cap needle pilot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and needle guide-way <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is referred to in this specification as needle guide-way <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates hypodermic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the fully extended position. Needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is positioned in the fully extended position by pushing upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the distal direction by using thumb pressure on upper piston grip segment <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> while grasping one or both barrel grips <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are matingly and slidably engaged along their longitudinal interface by channel slide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and channel key <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, respectively. Channel slide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, may have a hemispherical cross-section or some other suitable shape that is capable of minimal binding with mating channel key <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Channel key <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, must have substantially the same shape as channel slide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, but in reverse so that it matingly engages with channel slide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The fit between channel slide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and channel key <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may vary from relatively loose to tight, depending upon the material from which each is fabricated. Generally, channel slide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and channel key <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> clearance may close if the material for both channel slide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and channel key <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are fabricated of a plastic such as polycarbonate and polypropylene, as previously disclosed in this written description. Lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is shown inside barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a fully depressed position seated in lock depression space <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to slide within barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or distal end of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is out of its protective needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> portion of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> combination. Needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> penetrated seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on its excursion through luer needle guide <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and then continued on through end cap needle guide <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Support plate plug <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is extended into and mated with support plate plug cavity <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, thereby assisting the centering of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in luer needle guide <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and end cap needle guide <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> freely rides in barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> since it has a diameter substantially equal to the inside diameter of barrel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, providing a slidable but tight fit between support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is forced distally by upper faceplate segment <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> when piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is moved distally. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show the relationship of push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and needle bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extends into bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> up to the proximal end of implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> need not extend to implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, but by doing so it provides an efficient method of loading implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into needle bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> during manufacture of hypodermic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. During manufacture, implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be inserted into needle bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the proximal end and then support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> combination inserted into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the proximal end. Next, upper and lower piston segments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are inserted into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and pressed towards the distal end of hypodermic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> until they are stopped from further movement by their respective locks <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Since push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is in axial alignment with needle bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is automatically inserted into needle bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> combination is moved in a direction from the proximal end of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the distal end by movement of upper and lower piston segments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in that direction. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is shown inserted into needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and adjacent implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also illustrates that push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> partially resides in channel slide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> along a portion of its longitudinal length extending from lower face plate segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to upper face plate segment <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This is necessary because, as shown, both upper and lower piston segments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are cross-sectionally equal; yet push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (which is mounted on lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) must be axially aligned with needle bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is affixed to lower face plate segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by push rod taper <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which allows for easy break-away or bending as will be described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The length of lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shorter than that of upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. And, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the resulting offset <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> between lower and upper piston segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is positioned at the distal end of the two piston segments and not at their proximal end, so that lower face plate segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is more proximal than that of upper face plate segment <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The offset <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is maintained at the distal end of the piston segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by interlocking stop <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and stop tab <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in pistol grip <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which is most easily observed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Stop <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and stop tab <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in effect preset the location of offset <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> at the distal end of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by halting the travel of lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> since the distance that stop tab <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can travel before its movement is halted by stop <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is equal to the length of travel channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>), which in turn is equal to the distance that lower and upper piston segments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are offset <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the first of three sequences of operation. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has been extended outside of needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, its protective sheaf. Pushing upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the distal direction as far as it will move extends needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Prior to injection of implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> had to be depressed as described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Movement of upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is stopped when support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is adjacent the distal end of needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In that position, push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has been extracted from needle bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. However, push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> remains in support plate guide way <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) for easy re-entry into needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through needle inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> due to the angled walls of guide way <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> towards needle inlet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> remains in needle bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at this stage of operation. Prior to pushing upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> distally, lock <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> must be depressed to allow segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to travel into barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. During distal movement of upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, its channel slide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> traveled along channel key <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> allowing for smooth, low friction movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates hypodermic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> after injection of implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has been moved distally so that stop tab <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is up against stop <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> retarding further movement. Further movement is also retarded by movement of lower faceplate segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> against the distal end of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this position, offset <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> between upper and lower faceplate segments <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> no longer exists as the offset now exists at the proximal end of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Distal movement of lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> caused movement of push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into needle bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Since offset <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is now absent at the distal end of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is able to travel further into needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> than it could in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by the length of offset <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The added length of penetration of push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> causes implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be ejected out of needle nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and into the patient, other subject, or object. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also illustrates that upper and lower face plate segments <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are now in an abutting relationship, whereas in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> there was space between them. That space was maintained by the force of preload spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, pre-load spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> will cause upper faceplate segment <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to separate from support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> once the user of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> releases force on piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Release of the force, however, will not cause uniform separation between support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the combination of upper face plate segment <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and lower face plate segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> because hook <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on lower face plate segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has engaged undercut <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on the distal face of support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. As will most often be the case, the user will inject implant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and then immediately proceed to retract piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in its final state of use and ready for disposal. In this position, needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is fully retracted from support plate plug cavity <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> into the safety of needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by the user&apos;s retraction of upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which causes lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to also retract due to the interaction of stop <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and stop tab <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, when the distally driven force on piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is relieved, pre-load spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> will cause the upper portion of support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to tilt within needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> due to engagement, during the injection phase illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, of undercut <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by hook <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Since there is nothing supporting the distal end of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at this point, it falls down into needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> where it can no longer be extended outside barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is no longer usable and is ready for disposal with needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> already in a sharps container-needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&mdash;protecting living beings or property from damage caused by sharp needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> During the injection phase, resilient hook <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is forced to ride up on ramp <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) of support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to the point where it reaches undercut <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, at which point resilient hook <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> snaps into undercut <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and engages the lower portion of support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Upon full retraction of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> into needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the force of pre-load spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> forces supports plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to tilt at tilt angle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Tilt angle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in one embodiment approximates 10 degrees. Tilting of support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is also assisted by the differential friction between the upper portion of circumferential rim <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of support plate <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and barrel wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. There is no friction between the lower portion of circumferential rim <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of support plate <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and barrel wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the region of undercut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> because undercut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is located on a chord <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of support plate <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and chord <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> does not contact barrel wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Chord <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A, 8B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C. The location of chord <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</cross-reference>, is located towards the bottom of each of the figures. Therefore, that area exerts the least frictional force and tipping occurs elsewhere with hook <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and undercut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> acting as the fulcrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Little resistance to this tilting force is encountered from push rod <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which remains in needle bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, since it is connected to lower face plate segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by relatively thin push rod taper <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The result of the tilting action is that nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> end of needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> tilts against a wall of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and is restrained by distal end of barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from entering support plate plug cavity <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and being further extended outside of needle receptacle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for further use. Even an active attempt to shake needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> into alignment with support plate plug cavity <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will not be met with success due to force of pre-load spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> maintaining needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Retraction of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is accomplished by exerting a force directed in the proximal direction on either upper and lower piston segments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or only upper piston segment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In either case as the piston segments are pulled proximally, stop <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> will engage stop tab <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and cause lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to ride along. Upon retraction of piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, support plate <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is pulled along with piston <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the proximal direction by hook <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on faceplate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Undercut <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is along chord <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of support plate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as is ramp <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Hook <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is clearly seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> as engaged with undercut <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and as having an arcuate wall to conform to the diameter of barrel wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> with which it matingly engages and travels against during movement of lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Pre-load lever <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is made of the same resilient plastic material, as previously described, as are the other elements of hypodermic implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Pre-load lever <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is integrally molded into upper faceplate segment <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and is seated into pre-load lever seat <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> when compressed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Pre-load spring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and pre-load lever and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> represent two illustrated embodiments of a biasing means for tilting support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, but any means that accomplishes the function of tilting support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is contemplated by this invention. Such a means could include no biasing method other than the frictional force between the upper portion of support plate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and barrel wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> coupled with engagement of hook <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9, 10A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C illustrate the particular details of the barrel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and lower piston segment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> more clearly than possible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates the general assembly of implant device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
