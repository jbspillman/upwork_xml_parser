<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">When a vehicle advances in parallel with a parking frame to reach an initial stop position, measurement of a distance to a parked vehicle is continuously performed by means of an ultrasonic sensor and a moving distance of the vehicle is simultaneously calculated using a signal from a wheel speed sensor. When actuating an in-line mode switch under a state where the vehicle stops in the initial stop position, a turning angle is calculated so as to enable appropriate in-line parking to the parking frame from an actual initial stop position, based on a deviation of the vehicle from a reference position for the initial stop measured by the ultrasonic sensor. Information on a driving operation that is necessary for back parking is provided to a driver via a speaker based on this turning angle and output from a yaw rate sensor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a parking assisting device, and more particularly to a device for guiding a driver a driving operation upon parking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, there is an assisting device for showing a rear view of a vehicle on a television screen in a state where the vehicle stops in an initial stop position at a time of parking and superimposing to display on the television screen guiding information on a driving operation that is necessary for the parking. With such a device, parking can be easily conducted by merely performing the driving operation following the guiding information displayed on the television screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, aburden is imposed on a driver if the driver performs the parking operation while looking at the television screen. Therefore, it is proposed to provide the guiding information through sound or the like. In this way, there is no need for the driver to pay attention to the television screen, and the burden imposed on the driver is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, when the guiding information containing information ranging from an initial stop position to parking completion is provided to the driver through sound or the like, in a case where the initial stop position is deviated from a reference position set in advance, the deviation can not be eliminated, with the result that there is a fear that accuracy in the parking is degraded. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention is made in view of solving the above-mentioned problem, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a parking assisting device capable of accurately guiding a driving operation even when a vehicle is not precisely stopped in a previously set reference position for an initial stop and performing parking assistance with high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A parking assisting device according to the present invention includes: a first distance sensor for measuring a distance to an obstacle on a side of a vehicle; a second distance sensor for measuring a moving distance of the vehicle; yaw angle detecting means for detecting a yaw angle of the vehicle; guiding means for outputting guiding information on a driving operation to a driver; and a controller for grasping an initial stop position based on the distance to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle measured by the first distance sensor and the moving distance of the vehicle measured by the second distance sensor at a time of an advancing operation of the vehicle until reaching the initial stop position and for providing to the driver via the guiding means appropriate timing for a temporal stop for back parking based on the initial stop position and the yaw angle detected by the yaw angle detecting means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Note that, it is possible to construct the controller so as to measure a deviation between an actual initial stop position and a reference position for the initial stop based on the distance to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle measured by the first distance sensor and the moving distance of the vehicle measured by the second distance sensor and simultaneously to calculate the appropriate timing for the temporal stop for the back parking based on the measured deviation and the yaw angle detected by the yaw angle detecting means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In this case, the controller may guide via the guiding means the driver to an effect of stopping the vehicle when the controller judges that the vehicle has reached the initial stop position based on the distance to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle measured by the first distance sensor and the moving distance of the vehicle measured by the second distance sensor at the time of the advancing operation of the vehicle until reaching the initial stop position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The controller can provide via the guiding means to the driver the guiding information of: advancing the vehicle with a steering angle at the maximum from the initial stop position and stopping the vehicle in a back start position; moving the vehicle backward with the steering angle at the maximum in an opposite direction from the back start position and stopping the vehicle in a steering wheel cutting position; and moving the vehicle backward with the steering angle at the maximum in the opposite direction again from the steering wheel cutting position so as to cause the vehicle to reach a target parking space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, it is also possible to construct the controller so as to calculate the appropriate timing for the temporal stop through calculating an inclination of the vehicle with respect to the target parking space based on the distance to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle measured by the first distance sensor and the moving distance of the vehicle measured by the second distance sensor at the time of the advancing operation of the vehicle until reaching the initial stop position and adding this inclination to the deviation between the actual initial stop position and the reference position for the initial stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further, it is also possible to construct the controller so as to calculate a suitable initial stop position based on the distance to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle measured by the first distance sensor and simultaneously guide via the guiding means the driver to an effect of stopping the vehicle when the controller judges that the vehicle has reached the initial stop position based on the moving distance of the vehicle measured by the second distance sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The controller can provide via the guiding means to the driver guiding information of: moving the vehicle backward with the steering angle at the maximum from the initial stop position and stopping the vehicle at the steering wheel cutting position; and moving the vehicle backward with the steering angle at the maximum in the opposite direction from the steering wheel cutting position so as to cause the vehicle to reach the target parking space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further, the controller may calculate the inclination of the vehicle with respect to the target parking space based on the distance to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle measured by the first distance sensor and the moving distance of the vehicle measured by the second distance sensor at the time of the advancing operation of the vehicle until reaching the initial stop position, and calculate the suitable initial stop position according to this inclination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The controller can also store as a history the distance to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle measured by the first distance sensor and the moving distance of the vehicle measured by the second distance sensor and simultaneously calculate the suitable initial stop position based on this history. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Note that, the controller can also measure a length of the target parking space based on the distance to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle measured by the first distance sensor and the moving distance of the vehicle measured by the second distance sensor at the time of the advancing operation of the vehicle until reaching the initial stop position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further, the controller may give a warning to the driver in a case where interference of the vehicle with the obstacle is predicted when the vehicle moves under a state of being held at a uniform steering angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is possible to use an ultrasonic sensor or a sensor using an electromagnetic wave as the first distance sensor, and a wheel speed sensor as the second distance sensor, respectively.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, description will be made of embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a construction of a parking assisting device in accordance with Embodiment 1 of the present invention. Connected to a controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are: a yaw rate sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for detecting an angular speed in a direction of a yaw angle of a vehicle; a switch module <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> constituted by an in-parallel mode switch <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for informing the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that a vehicle is parked in parallel; and an in-line mode switch <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for informing the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that the vehicle is parked in line. Further, a speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for guiding driver information on a driving operation is connected with the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In addition, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected with an ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> serving as a first distance sensor for measuring a distance to an obstacle on a side of the vehicle and a wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> serving as a second distance sensor for measuring a moving distance of the vehicle. The wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> detects rpm of wheels of the vehicle, and can calculate the moving distance of the vehicle based on a signal from the wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by means of the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The switch module <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are arranged in a driver seat, and the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is installed on a front end side portion of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with a CPU, a ROM storing a control program and a working RAM (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the ROM, there is stored data on a minimum turning radius Rc for a case where the vehicle turns with a steering wheel of the vehicle steered at maximum. At the same time, the control program for performing parking assistance upon the in-parallel parking and the in-line parking of the vehicle is stored in the ROM. The CPU operates based on the control program stored in the ROM. The controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> calculates a yaw angle of the vehicle from the angular speed of the vehicle inputted from the yaw rate sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, calculates a turning angle of the vehicle and outputs information on an operation method and operation timing in each step during the parking operation to the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Here, what kind of track the parking assisting device of this embodiment causes the vehicle to draw to assist in-line parking will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It is assumed that a vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is parked in a parking frame T such that a rear left end of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> coincides with a corner S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the back of the parking frame T. A rear axle center MO of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a vehicle position M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in this state is assumed to be an origin, and a Y axis is taken in a direction in parallel with a road, which is a backward direction of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and an X axis is taken perpendicularly to the Y axis. In addition, coordinates at the corner in the back of the parking frame T are assumed to be S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/2, a<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Here, a<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denote a rear overhang and a vehicle width of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is assumed that the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a vehicle position J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> advances while turning at the radius Rc with a steering angle of the steering wheel at the maximum rightward; when the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reaches a vehicle position K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves backward while turning at the radius Rc with the steering angle at the maximum leftward; and, when the vehicle reaches a vehicle position L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves backward while turning at the radius Rc with the steering angle at the maximum rightward to appropriately be parked in the vehicle position M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> within the parking frame T. </paragraph>

In this case, a turning center is assumed to be C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a turning angle is assumed to be &bgr;. In addition, the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the vehicle position K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> moves backward to the vehicle position L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> while turning at the radius Rc with the steering angle at the maximum leftward. In this case, a turning center is assumed to be C<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a turning angle is assumed to be &dgr;. Moreover, the steering wheel is cut in the opposite direction in the vehicle position L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> moves backward to the vehicle position M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> while turning at the minimum turning radius Rc with the steering angle at the maximum rightward.

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Next, an operation of the parking assisting device in accordance with Embodiment 1 at the time of the in-line parking will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> advances straight forward in parallel with the road, namely, in parallel with the target parking frame T, to the vehicle position J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is the position where the Y coordinate of the position DR of the driver coincides with the Y coordinate of the rear end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are spaced apart from each other by the vehicle distance d, for example, by 50 cm. In this case, while the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> advances, measurement of a distance from the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle, the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, for example, is continuously performed by means of the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that is installed on the front end side portion of the vehicle. The vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> gradually approaches the vehicle position J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and reaches the position where the Y coordinate of the position DR of the driver coincides with the Y coordinate of the rear end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Here, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a measured distance x to the obstacle corresponding to the position of the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, being accompanied with the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is advancing. There is not existed a vehicle in the target parking frame T, and thus the measured distance x becomes an extremely large value when the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes the side of the parking frame T. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when a Y coordinate of the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> reaches a coordinate y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which coincides with the Y coordinate of the rear end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the measured distance x abruptly decreases to be a distance from the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The measured distance x in this case can be expressed by a sum of the distance of 50 cm from the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is a reference position ST for the initial stop, and a deviation dx<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in an x direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can recognize that the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has arrived at the coordinate y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> based on this abrupt change in the measured distance x. Then, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> stores a length LD from a front end of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the position DR of the driver in advance and monitors a moving distance of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which was calculated by a signal from the wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has advanced by the distance LD from the point where the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> reaches the coordinate y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, specific stop sound is emitted for the driver via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The driver stops the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> upon hearing this stop sound. As a result, the Y coordinate of the position DR of the driver coincides with the Y coordinate of the rear end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, whereby the position is made to be the initial stop position. The measured distance x obtained by the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in this case can be expressed by a sum of the distance of 50 cm from the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> serving as the reference position ST for the initial stop and a deviation dx<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the x direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is difficult to precisely position the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the reference position ST for the initial stop, and thus the above-mentioned deviations dx<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and dx<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the x direction are likely to generate. Note that, the deviation dx<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the deviation dx<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are equal to each other when the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> travels in parallel with the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, in a case where the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> travels slantly with a certain inclination, the values of the deviations become different from each other. The distance between the coordinates y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the distance LD that is stored in advance in the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is possible to obtain even the inclination of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in this initial stop position with respect to the reference position ST for the initial stop from the deviations dx<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and dx<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the distance LD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the driver activates the in-line mode switch <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the state where the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stops in the initial stop position, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> obtains coordinates (JOx&plus;dx, JOy&plus;dy) of a rear axle center JO&prime; as an actual initial stop position from the thus measured deviations dx<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and dx<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the normal coordinates JOx and Joy of the rear axle center JO, to thereby calculate the above-mentioned turning angles &agr;, &bgr; and &dgr; so as to appropriately park the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in line in the parking frame T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sets the initial stop position as a position where the yaw angle of the vehicle is zero degree and simultaneously activates a program for in-line parking based on the operation of the in-line mode switch <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The driver steers the steering wheel of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the maximum rightward to bring it to a fully cut state and advances the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in that state. The controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> calculates the yaw angle of the vehicle from the angular speed of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> inputted from the yaw rate sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and compares this yaw angle with the value of the calculated turning angle &bgr;. As the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> approaches the vehicle position K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is a back start position, from the initial stop position, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> informs the driver of approach information notifying that the vehicle has approached the vehicle position K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and arrival information notifying that the vehicle has reached the vehicle position K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> based on the difference between the yaw angle and the calculated turning angle &bgr; via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For example, intermittent sound such as &ldquo;blip, blip&rdquo; is emitted from the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as the approach information, and the cycle of this intermittent sound and blinking becomes shorter when the difference between the yaw angle and the turning angle &bgr; is decreased. When the difference between the yaw angle and the turning angle &bgr; is eliminated, continuous sound such as &ldquo;bleep&rdquo; is emitted from the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as the arrival information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The driver stops the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the vehicle position K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the arrival information. Next, the driver steers the steering wheel to the maximum leftward to bring it to a fully cut state and moves the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> backward in that state. The controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> compares the yaw angle of the vehicle and the value of the calculated turning angle &agr; (&equals;&bgr;&plus;&dgr;). As the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> approaches the vehicle position L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is a steering wheel cutting position, from the vehicle position K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is, as the yaw angle of the vehicle approaches the value of the calculated turning angle &agr;, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> informs the driver of approach information notifying that the vehicle has approached the vehicle position L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and arrival information notifying that the vehicle has reached the vehicle position L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> based on the difference between the yaw angle and the calculated turning angle &agr; via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The driver stops the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the vehicle position L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the arrival information. Next, the driver cuts the steering wheel in the opposite direction in the vehicle position L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, steers it to the maximum rightward to bring it to a fully cut state and moves the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> backward in that state. As the yaw angle of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> approaches zero degree, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> informs the driver of approach information notifying that the vehicle has approached the vehicle position M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> within the parking frame T and arrival information notifying that the vehicle has reached the vehicle position M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the driver stops the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the vehicle position M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, whereby the parking is completed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A parking assisting device according to Embodiment 2 has the same construction as the parking assisting device of Embodiment 1 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the parking assisting device according to this embodiment is effective in a case where not only is the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> already parked in front of the target parking frame T but also a vehicle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is parked behind the target parking frame T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> First, while the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> advances straight forward in parallel with the road from a side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that is parked behind the target parking frame T, measurement of a distance to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle is continuously performed by means of the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This distance measurement by means of the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is continuously performed until the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reaches the initial stop position, that is, until the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reaches the position where the Y coordinate ace of the position DR of the driver coincides with the Y coordinate of the rear end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In this case, in accordance with the advancement of vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a distance x measured with the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. A distance to the vehicle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that is parked behind the parking frame T is measured first. However, a vehicle does not exist after a time when a Y coordinate of the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> reaches a coordinate y<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> which coincides with a Y coordinate of a front end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and thus the measured distance x becomes an extremely large value. Further, when the Y coordinate of the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> reaches the coordinate y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which coincides with the Y coordinate of the rear end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is parked in front of the parking frame T, the measured distance x abruptly decreases to be a distance from the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can recognize that the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has arrived at the coordinates y<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> based on this abrupt change in the measured distance x, and a distance PSL by which the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has moved during the above-mentioned operation can be calculated using a signal from the wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This distance PSL expresses a length of a parking space formed by the parked vehicles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> After the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> reaches the coordinate y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as in Embodiment 1, when the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has advanced by the distance LD and the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> reaches the coordinate y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, specific stop sound is emitted for the driver via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The driver stops the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> upon hearing this stop sound.

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Then, when the driver actuates the in-line mode switch <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in a state where the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stops in the initial stop position, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> calculates the turning angles &agr;, &bgr; and &dgr; so that the driver can appropriately park the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in line from the actual initial stop position to the parking frame T based on the measured deviations dx<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and dx<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the length PSL of the parking space. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the forward distance D can be obtained from the vehicle distance B between the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made of an operation upon in-line parking of the parking assisting device according to Embodiment 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> First, the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> advances forward in parallel with a road, and the in-line mode switch <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is actuated while the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes the side of the parking space. With this, measurement of a distance to the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is continuously performed by means of the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> installed on the front end side portion of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the same manner as that in Embodiment 1, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> recognizes that the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> reaches the rear end position of the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and simultaneously measures the vehicle distance B between the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. According to the above-mentioned procedure, the forward distance D from the rear end of the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the front end of the suitable initial stop position P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the turning angle &ggr; required thereafter can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> monitors a moving distance of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> calculated using a signal from the wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has advanced by the forward distance D from a point where the ultrasonic sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> reaches the rear end position of the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, specific stop sound is emitted for the driver via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The driver stops the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> upon hearing this stop sound. As a result, the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stops in the suitable initial stop position P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> resets a yaw angle of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> obtained by the yaw rate sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the driver steers the steering wheel of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the maximum leftward to bring it to a fully cut state and moves the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> backward in that state. The controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> compares the yaw angle of the vehicle to the value of the determined turning angle &ggr;, outputs approach information via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the yaw angle approaches the turning angle &ggr;, and further outputs arrival information via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the yaw angle becomes equal to the turning angle &ggr;, judging that the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has reached the steering wheel cutting position Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The driver stops the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the steering wheel cutting position Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the arrival information. Here, the driver cuts the steering wheel in the opposite direction and steers it to the maximum rightward to bring it to a fully cut state, and moves the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> backward in that state. As the yaw angle of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> approaches zero degree, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> informs the driver of the approach information notifying that the vehicle has approached a vehicle position R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> within the target parking space and the arrival information notifying that the vehicle has reached the vehicle position R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the driver can stop the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the vehicle position R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, whereby parking is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Note that, the relationship of the distance D from the rear end of the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the front end of the suitable initial stop position P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the vehicle distance B of the turning angle &ggr; required thereafter is determined based on characteristics of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in, for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Also in Embodiment 3, in the same manner as in Embodiment 2, it is possible to guide capability and incapability of the parking through measuring the length of the target parking space when the vehicle advances straight forward toward the initial stop position, and to warn interference with the obstacle such as the vehicle that is parked behind. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> According to Embodiment 6 described above, in the same manner as in Embodiments 1 to 5, it is possible to provide the driver appropriate timing for the temporal stop under the fully cut state of the steering wheel via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and complete in-line parking in the parking frame T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Note that, also with the optical sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as in Embodiment 2, it is possible to measure the length of the parking space to utilize it for calculation of the turning angles &agr;, &bgr; and &dgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The optical sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be constituted by a combination of light emitting means such as an LED or a laser diode and light receiving means such as a phototransistor or a CCD device.

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Note that, in Embodiments 1 to 6 described above, it is possible to constitute the device so as to give a warning to the driver via the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in a case where it is impossible to calculate the turning angle that is applicable to the parking operation due to a large deviation and in a case where interference of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the obstacle such as the parked vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> upon in-line parking is predicted when turning the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the turning angle obtained based on the steering angle that is held at the maximum. In this manner, it is possible to prevent the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from interfering with the obstacle, according to the turning angle that is calculated by considering a positional deviation of the initial stop position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Further, in Embodiments 1 to 6, the yaw rate sensor is used as yaw angle detecting means. However, the means for detecting the yaw angle may also include a method using a position gyroscope or a method for detecting the yaw angle from a difference in rotation obtained by rotation sensors that are mounted to left and right wheels, respectively. Further, a method using a terrestrial magnetism sensor or a GPS system may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Note that, in Embodiments 1 to 6 described above, the approach information and the arrival information may change volume and timbre of the sound emitted from the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, or may cause sound having different contents to be emitted, for every vehicle position that is the target of the approach and the arrival of the vehicle. In addition, the guiding means is not limited to the speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and may be a buzzer, an LED or a lamp, and characters or marks may also be displayed on a display. Further, vibration may also be used, which is transmitted to the driver via the steering wheel or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, the first distance sensor measures the distance to the obstacle on the side of the vehicle and simultaneously the second distance sensor measures the moving distance of the vehicle at the time of the advancing operation of the vehicle until reaching the initial stop position, and the controller grasps the initial stop position based on those measured distances and provides to the driver via the guiding means the appropriate timing for the temporal stop for the back parking based on the initial stop position and the yaw angle detected by the yaw angle detecting means. As a result, it is possible to accurately guide the driver the driving operation upon parking without imposing a large burden on the driver even if the vehicle is not accurately stopped in the reference position for the initial stop set in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Further, when the appropriate initial stop position is guided, the number of operations upon back parking is reduced, whereby the burden imposed on the driver can be further decreased. </paragraph>
