<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In a molding process, a hybrid integrated circuit substrate is fixed the position of the substrate in a thickness direction. A leadframe is connected, with an upward inclination, to a hybrid integrated circuit substrate and transported into a mold cavity. By horizontally fixing the leadframe by mold dies, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate inclined upward is urged downward by a pushpin. This can fix the position of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate within the mold cavity and integrally transfer-molded. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hybrid integrated circuit device and manufacturing method thereof, and more particularly to a hybrid integrated circuit device having a resin seal body formed on a hybrid integrated circuit substrate by transfer molding and to a manufacturing method thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, there are, principally, two methods of sealing employed for hybrid integrated circuit devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The first method employs member having such a form as placing a lid, generally called a case member, on a hybrid integrated circuit substrate mounted with circuit elements of semiconductor chips or the like. This structure includes a hollow structure or that having a resin separately filled therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The second method is injection molding as a process to mold semiconductor ICs. This is described, e.g. in Japanese Patent Publication No. H11-330317. The injection molding generally uses thermoplastic resin. For example, the resin heated at 300&deg; C. is injected under a high injection pressure and poured into a mold at one time, whereby the resin is molded. Since a resin polymerization time is not required after pouring a resin into a mold, there is a merit to shorten the operation time as compared with transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Explanation will be made on a method of manufacturing a conventional hybrid integrated circuit device using injection molding, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> First, an aluminum (hereinafter, referred to as A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is employed as a metal substrate as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, in order for explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is anodized in its surface. Furthermore, a resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having an excellent insulation property is formed on the entire surface of the anodized A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, the oxide may be omitted where voltage resistance is not taken into consideration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B and 13C</cross-reference>, a resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by a support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a thermoplastic resin. Namely, a substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mounted on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is covered with thermoplastic resin by injection molding. The support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the thermoplastic resin have an abutment region. The abutment region of support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fused by the poured hot thermoplastic resin, thereby realizing a full-mold structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Herein, the thermoplastic resin adopted is a resin called PPS (polyphenyl sulfide). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The injection temperature of thermoplastic resin is as high as 300&deg; C. Consequently, there is a problem that solder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> be fused by the hot resin thereby causing poor soldering. For this reason, an overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed by potting a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) in a manner previously covering solder joints, metal fine wires <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, active elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and passive elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Due to this, the fine wires (approximately 30-80&mgr;m) particularly are prevented from being fallen down and broken under an injection resin pressure during forming with a thermoplastic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed through two stages shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B and 13C</cross-reference>. In the first stage, a gap is provided at between a backside of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a mold die. The support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is placed on the backside of the substrate, in consideration of securing a thickness at a backside of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> upon poring a resin under a high pressure into the gap. In the second stage, the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mounted on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>a is covered with a thermoplastic resin by injection molding. In the abutment region between the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the thermoplastic resin, the abutment region of the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fused by the poured hot thermoplastic resin thereby realizing a full-mold structure. Herein, the thermoplastic resin on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>preferably has an equivalent thermal expansion to that of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Next, explanation will be made on a conventional method of manufacturing a hybrid integrated circuit device using injection molding, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flowchart, including a metal substrate preparing process, an insulating layer forming process, a Cu foil pressure-laying process, a partial Ni plating process, a Cu foil etching process, a die bonding process, a wire bonding process, a potting process, a lead connection process, a support member attaching process, an injection mold process and a lead cutting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>C show the sectional views of the processes. Note that the processes, that are apparent without showing, are omittedly shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At first, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference> show a metal substrate preparing process, an insulating layer forming process, a Cu foil pressure-laying process, a partial Ni plating process and a Cu foil etching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the metal substrate preparing process, prepared is a substrate in consideration of its property of heat dissipation, substrate strength, substrate shield and the like. This example uses an Al substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a thickness, e.g. of approximately 1.5 mm, excellent in heat dissipation property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Next, a resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> excellent in insulation property is further formed over the entire surface of the aluminum substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. On the insulating resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a Cu conductor foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pressure-laid to constitute a hybrid integrated circuit. On the Cu foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an Ni plating <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided over the entire surface in consideration of adhesion to a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> electrically connecting between the Cu foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a lead-out electrode and an active element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a known screen-printing is used to form Ni plating <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a conductive path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</cross-reference> shows a die bonding process and a wire bonding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> On the conductive path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the preceding process, an active element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a passive element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are mounted through a conductive paste such as a solder paste <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby realizing a predetermined circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference> show a potting process, a lead connection process and a support member attaching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, in the potting process, prior to a later injection mold process, potting is previously made with a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) onto the solder junctions, metal fine wires <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, active elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and passive elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, thereby forming an overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Next, prepared is an outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for outputting and inputting signals from and to the hybrid integrated circuit. Thereafter, the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected to the external connection terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed in a peripheral area of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through a solder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>B, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected with the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the like is mounted on a support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. By mounting the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, it is possible to secure a thickness of a resin seal body at a backside of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during injection molding as explained in the next process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</cross-reference> shows an injection mold process and a lead cutting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figure, after potting is done with a thermosetting resin on the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form a overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by injection molding. At this time, in the abutment region between the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the thermoplastic resin, the abutment region of the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fused by the injected hot thermoplastic resin and turned into a full-mold structured resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Finally, the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is cut to a use purpose thereby adjusting the length of the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> By the above process, a hybrid integrated circuit device is completed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the semiconductor industry, it is a general practice to carry out a transfer mold process. In a hybrid integrated circuit device by the conventional transfer molding, a semiconductor chip is fixed on a leadframe, e.g. of Cu. The semiconductor chip and the lead are electrically connected through a gold wire (hereinafter, referred to as Au). This is because the impossibility of employing an Al fine wire in respect of its less elasticity and ready bendability and time-consumed bonding requiring ultrasonic waves. Consequently, there has not conventionally existed a hybrid integrated circuit device that is formed by one metal plate to have a circuit formed thereon and further the metal substrate wire-bonded by A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fine wires is directly transfer-molded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In a hybrid integrated circuit device of an injection mold type, there has been a need to prevent the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from being bent or broken under an injection pressure during molding, and the solder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from flowing at a temperature upon injection molding. For this reason, in the conventional structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> due to potting has been adopted in order to cope with the foregoing problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> However, because injection molding is carried out after potting a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) to form an overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, there is a problem of consuming a material cost for thermosetting resin together with operation cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in the hybrid integrated circuit device by the conventional transfer molding, a semiconductor chip or the like is fixed on an island. Accordingly, although the heat generated from the semiconductor chip or the like dissipates at the fixing region, there is a problem that there is a limitation in heat dissipating area resulting in poor heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because the wire bonding within the resin seal body uses Au wires resistive to resin injection pressure as noted above, it is not a current practice to carry out transfer molding with using Al fine wires. The A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fine wire is readily bent due to the causes of a weak neck resulting from ultrasonic bonding and further too low elastic modulus to withstand under injection pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the case of integrally sealing hybrid integrated circuit substrates by transfer molding, there is a need to fix the hybrid integrated circuit substrate in horizontal and thickness directions within a mold die. There is a problem that such fixing member has not been developed as to withstand under an injection pressure during molding. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A problem to be solved by the present invention is to fix a hybrid integrated circuit substrate in a predetermined position within the mold die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the foregoing problem, a hybrid integrated circuit device of the present invention comprises: a hybrid integrated circuit substrate formed of a metal substrate; a lead firmly fixed on the hybrid integrated circuit substrate; and a resin seal body transfer-molding the substrate and the lead; whereby the substrate is provided with a region on which a pushpin for fixing the substrate is to urge during transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the region where the pushpin is to urge is arranged in a peripheral region of the substrate. The pushpin can urge a region not provided with a conductor pattern or circuit element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the substrate and the thermosetting resin are exposed in a bottom of a hole formed by the pushpin. Due to this, by confirming a ratio of the substrate and insulating resin exposed in the hole bottom, it is possible to confirm a position of the substrate in the insulating resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A method of manufacturing a semiconductor integrated device of the invention comprises: a step of preparing a hybrid integrated circuit substrate insulation-treated at least in a surface thereof; a step of forming a conductor pattern on the substrate; a step of firmly fixing a semiconductor chip or passive element on the conductor pattern, a step of electrically connecting a lead to the substrate; and a step of molding a thermosetting resin over at least the surface of the substrate by transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the invention is characterized in that, by applying a downward urge force to the hybrid integrated circuit substrate by at least one pushpin, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate is prevented from moving under a pressure of resin injection within the mold cavity. This can fix the position of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate, thus solving the conventionally encountered problem. Furthermore, by fixing the position of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate can be covered, at its back surface, with a constant thickness by using a resin high in heat dissipation property, thereby improving the heat dissipation property on the hybrid integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the invention is characterized in that it is possible to confirm an area ratio of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate and thermosetting resin exposed in a hole bottom. This allows to confirm a position of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate within the hybrid integrated circuit device.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Explanation will be now made on a hybrid integrated circuit device according to a first embodiment of the invention with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, a structure of the hybrid integrated circuit device will be first explained. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> employs a substrate excellent in heat dissipation property in consideration of the heat generation of from the semiconductor chips fixed on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This embodiment explains a case using an aluminum substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Note that, although the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the embodiment uses an aluminum (hereinafter, referred to as Al) substrate, this is not necessarily limited to. For example, the embodiment is to be realized in case the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> uses a printed substrate, a ceramic substrate, a metal substrate or the like. The metal substrate may use a Cu substrate, an Fe substrate, an Fe-Ni substrate, an AlN (aluminum nitride) substrate or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is anodized in its surface, to further form an insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> excellent in insulation, e.g. epoxy resin, over the entire surface thereof. Note that this metal oxide may be omitted without problem where voltage resistance is not considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> On the resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by a Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). An epoxy resin, for example, is overcoated to protect the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, in a position except for electrical connection points. On the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, small-signal transistor or IC, and a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such as a chip resistor or chip capacitor, are mounted through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, a predetermined circuit is realized. Herein, by providing electrical connection using an Ag paste or the like, soldering may be partly omitted. In the case of mounting face up an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as a semiconductor chip, connection is through a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. For a power semiconductor chip, the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> uses an A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> wire having approximately 150-500 &mgr;m&phgr;, for example. This is generally called a thick wire. For a semi-power or small-signal semiconductor chip, used is an A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> wire having approximately 30-80 &mgr;m&phgr;, for example. This is generally called a fine wire. An external connection terminal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, in a peripheral area of the A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, is connected with an outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of Cu or Fe-Ni through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a resin seal body is directly formed over active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the like on the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Namely, in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the thermosetting resin for use in transfer molding has a low viscosity and a cure temperature lower than a melting point of the solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> used in the connection member, e.g. 183&deg; C. This can eliminate the overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> formed by potting a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) required on the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As a result, in case thermosetting resin is poured directly over the metal fine wire having a diameter, e.g. of approximately 40 &mgr;m, electrically connecting the small-signal IC or the like to the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>during transfer molding, there is no possibility of falling down, disconnection or bending. A feature of the present invention is that the A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fine wire is prevented from being bent during the molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> extend externally of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are adjusted in length in compliance with the purpose of use. Holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed as traces of pushpins in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, at two points close to a side opposite to a side the outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> extend. The holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are caused by pushpins <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) fixing the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> during transfer molding, which are left even after forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed in a peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, i.e. in a region not formed with a circuit or the like on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, because the holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed in the peripheral region of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> over the resin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, it is structurally free from problem in respect of quality and moisture resistance. Herein, the peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is a margin provided to secure a distance from a circuit area upon individually pressing the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, a conductive paths <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>a is densely formed on the A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. On the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, mounted are an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, small-signal transistor or IC, and a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such as a chip resistance or capacitance through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or the like. Meanwhile, outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are connected through external connection terminals <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, thereby realizing a predetermined circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figure, a complicated circuit is formed within a narrow space on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. According to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, after forming an insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> over the entire surface of the A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a complicated circuit is formed and thereafter outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are bonded to the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, followed by integrally, directly forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the conventional, where forming a hybrid integrated circuit device by transfer molding, a leadframe of Cu, for example, is worked by etching, punching or pressing to form wiring, lands and the like. It has been impossible to form such a complicated circuit as a conductor pattern of a hybrid integrated circuit. Meanwhile, with a leadframe for transfer molding, when forming a wiring as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, there is a need of fixing with suspension leads at various points in order to prevent against lead warpage. In this manner, a hybrid integrated circuit using a usual leadframe can mount several active parts at the utmost. Thus, there is a restriction in forming a hybrid integrated circuit having such a conductor pattern as that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Namely, by providing a structure of hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, a substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a complicated circuit can be formed by transfer molding. Furthermore, because the invention uses a substrate having a high thermal conductivity to carry out transfer molding, the heat generated can be dissipated at the entire of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as compared to the hybrid integrated circuit device using the conventional leadframe, the metal substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> directly molded acts as a large-sized heat-sink thus providing excellent heat dissipation and realizing circuit characteristic improvement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the thermosetting resin and hybrid integrated circuit substrate is exposed at the bottoms of the two holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> formed in a molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Setting is provided in a mold process such that, in the case that the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is fixed in a correct position, the thermosetting resin and the substrate are exposed, e.g., half-and-half in the bottom of the hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>so, where the substrate is not exposed at all in the respective bottoms of the two holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, this means that the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has moved in a thickness direction during the mold process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, by confirming the bottoms of the holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> after the molding process, it is possible to confirm a position of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate within the thermosetting resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Next, explanation will be made on a method of manufacturing a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a process flowchart, including a metal substrate preparing process, an insulating layer forming process, a Cu foil pressure-laying process, an Ni partial plating process, a Cu foil etching process, a die bonding process, a wire bonding process, a lead connection process, a transfer mold process, and a lead cutting process. As apparent from the flow, it is a conventional practice to form a resin seal body by injection molding. The invention, however, has realized a process to form a resin seal body by transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B show the processes of manufacturing hybrid integrated circuit device. Note that the processes, that are apparent without showing, are omitted in the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The first process of the invention includes preparing a metal substrate, forming an insulating layer, pressure-laying a Cu foil and carrying out Ni plating, as show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the metal substrate preparing process, a substrate is prepared taking into consideration the properties of heat dissipation, substrate strength, substrate shield and so on. In this case, emphasis is placed particularly on heat dissipation property because heat concentration is caused by density increase where densely mounting integrating power transistors, largescaled LSIs, digital signal processing circuits, etc. on one small-sized hybrid IC. The present embodiment explains the case using an A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a thickness of, e.g. approximately 1.5 mm, that is excellent in heat dissipation property. A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>though this embodiment explains the case using an A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> substrate as the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, there is no especial limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> For example, the present example can be realized by using, as the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a print substrate, a ceramic substrate, a metal substrate or the like. It is possible to consider, as a metal substrate, a Cu substrate, an FeNi substrate or a chemical substance of a metal excellent in conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Next, the aluminum substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is anodized to cause an oxide in its surface. Furthermore, a resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> excellent in insulation property, e.g. epoxy resin, is formed on the entire surface thereof. Note that the metal oxide may be omitted without problem where voltage resistance is not taken into consideration. Then, a Cu conductor foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is pressure-laid on the insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, to constitute a hybrid integrated circuit. On the Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, Ni plating is provided over the entire surface in consideration of an adhesion to a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for electrical connection between the Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for turning into an lead-out electrode and the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The second process of the invention includes forming Ni plating and etching the Cu foil as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> On the Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, resist is left only in an area requiring Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by known screen-printing or the like to form a selective mask. Then, Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by etching, e.g. in an area for turning into an lead-out electrode, on the Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the resist is removed away. Again, resist is left only in an area requiring a Cu-foil conductor pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by known screen-printing or the like to form a selective mask. Then, a conductor pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed from Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on the insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by etching. Thereafter, an overcoat is formed of an epoxy resin on the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by screen-printing, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The third process of the invention includes carrying out die bonding and wire bonding, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> On the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the preceding process, an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, a small-signal transistor or IC, and a passive element such as a chip resistor or a chip capacitor, are mounted through a conductive paste, such as a solder paste <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thereby realizing a predetermined circuit. Herein, by providing electrical connection with an Ag paste or the like, solder may not be partly employed. Meanwhile, when mounting an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as a power transistor or a semi-power transistor, a heat-sink is provided between the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in consideration of heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Next, in the case of mounting face up an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as a semiconductor chip, electrical connection is made through a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> by bonding. As noted above, the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for electrical connection between the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is wire-bonded through the Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in consideration of an adhesion to the Cu-foiled conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Herein, the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> employs especially an A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Because an A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is difficult in forming a true-sphere ball, a stitch bonding scheme is employed. However, the stitch bonding scheme is featured that a stitch point is readily broken by a resin stress and low in elastic modulus as compared to an Au wire thus readily fallen down under resin pressure. Accordingly, where using an A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, caution must be paid especially during forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The fourth process of the invention includes carrying out lead connection, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, prepared is an outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for outputting and inputting signals from and to the foregoing hybrid integrated circuit. The outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is of a conductor material of Cu, Fe&mdash;Ni or the like in order for use as an output-and-input terminal. Furthermore, a width and thickness of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is determined taking account of a current capacity and the like. The embodiment of the invention, although detailed in the next transfer mold process, requires a strength and springiness in the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and prepares an outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> having a thickness of approximately, e.g. 0.4-0.5 mm. Thereafter, the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected to the external connection terminal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> formed in the peripheral region of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this case, the connecting member is not necessarily limited to solder but connection may be by spot welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Herein, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, according to the invention, the outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are connected to the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at a somewhat angle relative to a mount surface thereof. The angle defined between the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is to be considered approximately 10&deg;, for example. The cure temperature of a thermosetting resin to be used in the next transfer mold process is set lower than the melting point of a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for connecting between the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the external connection electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The fifth process of the invention, the process is to integrally mold the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with a thermosetting resin by transfer molding, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In order to seal the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by transfer molding, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> must be fixed in position within a mold cavity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. However, in the case of integrally transfer-molding the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, there is a difficulty in directly fixing the hybrid integrated circuit substrates <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> be moved under a resin-pouring pressure within the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in this process, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at a peripheral region is pushed by at least one pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> provided in an upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Resin is filled after the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is fixed in position within the mold cavity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> soldered with a leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is transferred into the mold cavity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is fixed by the upper and lower mold dies <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at a peripheral point is urged by the pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, thereby fixing the position of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at within the mold cavity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> has a plurality of leads connected by a first connecting portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>d and second connecting portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Furthermore, this is solder-joined to the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> not in parallel but with an upward inclination. Accordingly, as shown In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, when the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is horizontally placed, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> assumes an upwardly inclined position within the mold cavity <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is a projection provided at least one in the upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. This acts to urge the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at its peripheral point when the upper and lower mold dies <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are fitted together. Meanwhile, the pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> has a length to horizontally position the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> within the mold cavity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> when it pushes the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the mold pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> urges at the peripheral point of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> inclined due to fixing the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in the mold, whereby the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be fixed in vertical position by an downward urging force of the pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and an upward stress of the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, by abutting a particular point of the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> connected to the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> against a guide pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> provided on the mold, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be fixed in horizontal position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, although the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is fixed by using the pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> fixed on the upper mold die as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> on the above explanation, there is a method to use a movable pushpin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>. Where using a movable pushpin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, after completing resin pouring, the pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is pulled out and the resin thereafter is cured. Accordingly, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is free of exposure and hence the hybrid integrated circuit substrate is further improved in moisture resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, in the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, a thermosetting resin is injected into the mold cavity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> such that it first hits a side surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. Then, the injection thermosetting resin, at an arrow <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, is branched by the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to flow toward the upper and the lower of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as shown at arrows <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. At this time, a flow width <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for the upper of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided nearly the same as a flow width <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> for the lower of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Thus, the thermosetting resin smoothly flows toward the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the thermosetting resin is reduced in injection velocity and pressure by its once hitting at the side surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> from being bent or broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> From the above, the present process can integrally transfer-mold hybrid integrated circuit substrates <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with using a thermosetting resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in the case that the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is urged by a fixed pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in a peripheral part is exposed at the bottom of a pushpin hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> after completing a molding process, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. However, because the peripheral region of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is a margin required in blanking the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, no conductor patterns, etc. are provided therein. Accordingly, because an overcoat is provided on the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> not to expose the metal substrate to the outside, the hybrid integrated circuit device is free from the deterioration in moisture resistance due to the hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Moreover, because the margin region used in pin abutment, the substrate surface is utilized more effectively than the use of a circuit region in abutment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, by confirming an area ratio of the metal substrate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and resin <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>exposed in the bottom of the hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, it is possible to confirm a presence or absence of a movement of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the molding process. Design is made such that, when the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is molded in a desired position, the hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> bottom is occupied, for example, a half by the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Consequently, where a desired area of the metal substrate is not exposed in the hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> bottom, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is considered having moved horizontally in the molding process. Meanwhile, when there is no exposure of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the both bottoms of the two holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate is considered having moved in a thickness direction in the molding process. From the above, it is possible to determine whether the molding process has been correctly done or not, by confirming the hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> bottoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The sixth process of the invention includes cutting the leads, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The leaked resin out of the mold dies <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in the preceding transfer-mold process is dammed at the second connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed on the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, and cures as it is. As a result, the area of between the leads of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> closer than the second connection <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is filled with leaked resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. No resin is filled between the leads closer than the second connection to the tip of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> By blanking out the second connection <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>portion, individual leads of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are made independent. The outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is adjusted in length in compliance with a use purpose. For, example, the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is cut at a position of a dotted line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, the leaked resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> also is removed away. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> By the above process, a hybrid integrated circuit device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, in a transfer-molding process, the hybrid integrated circuit device is fixed in position within the mold by being urged at a peripheral point of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate by the pushpin. Due to this, the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated device of the invention can omit the use of a support member as required in the conventional manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device. Furthermore, the hybrid integrated circuit device completed is greatly improved in heat dissipation property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The hybrid integrated circuit device and manufacturing thereof of the invention was explained on the hybrid integrated circuit device of the full mold type. However, the invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiment. For example, it is possible to form a hybrid integrated circuit device having a shape entirely exposed at a backside of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate. In this case, an effect of heat dissipation is further obtained besides the above-noted effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, although this embodiment was explained on the case with the one-sided leads that external leads extend at one side surface of the substrate, the invention is not limited to that structure. In the case with double-sided leads or four-way leads, besides the above-noted effect, transfer-mold process can be realized in a state the substrate is stabilized. Besides, various modifications are possible within a range not departing from the gist of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As explained above, the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention and manufacturing thereof has the following excellent effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> By urging a peripheral point of a hybrid integrated circuit substrate by the use of a pushpin provided on the mold die during a molding process, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate can be fixed in position within the cavity of the mold. Furthermore, hybrid integrated circuit substrates can be integrally transfer-molded, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate can be molded, at its surface, in a constant thickness with a thermosetting resin excellent in heat conductivity, making possible to fabricate a hybrid integrated circuit device excellent in heat dissipation property. Incidentally, the use of a pushpin exposes a part of a peripheral region of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate where no conductor patterns are provided. However, because the hybrid integrated circuit substrate has an insulating layer formed on the metal substrate, there is no moisture-resistance deterioration in the hybrid integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the invention, by confirming a bottom of a hole formed by the pushpin, it is possible to confirm a position of a hybrid integrated circuit substrate at the inside of the hybrid integrated circuit device. Specifically, by confirming the area ratio of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate and thermosetting resin being exposed to the hole bottom, it is possible to confirm a horizontal position of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate. Meanwhile, by confirming a presence or absence of an exposure of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate, it is possible to confirm a thickness position of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate. </paragraph>
