<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Disclosure </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The disclosure relates to a method for forming a bit line of a semiconductor device and, more particularly, to a method for forming a bit line of a semiconductor device, in which tungsten is deposited just after depositing a metallic barrier layer, a nitride layer is deposited after forming a bit line to prevent the bit line from oxidation due to the exposure of tungsten, and then a rapid thermal treatment is performed, whereby the contact resistance of the bit line is stabilized, and an additional process of depositing TiN due to the micro crack generated by the rapid thermal treatment is not needed, so the manufacturing process becomes simple and the productivity of manufacturing the semiconductor device is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The degree of integration and processing speed of semiconductor memory devices, especially dynamic random access memory (DRAM), have steadily increased. In order to make high speed devices, it is necessary to secure a stable contact resistance and to reduce the sheet resistance of a bit line and a word line. Therefore, there is a need to use a material of low resistance in forming a line. For example, in forming a word line of a DRAM, polysilicon has been used for 4 megabytes DRAM, and tungsten silicide was used for 16 megabytes DRAM. There have been continuous attempts to use titanium silicide having a resistance lower than such a material in manufacturing a DRAM of greater integrity than one gigabyte, and even a pure metal such as tungsten having an even lower resistance than silicide has been seriously considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As is well-known, the sub-layer formed with a bit line contact is composed of an impurity diffusion area (N&minus;type or P&plus;type impurity area) of a peripheral circuit area, a tungsten silicide layer of a gate electrode, or a polysilicon pad of an active area. A barrier material is required to lower the contact resistance between the different areas and prevent the current leakage, and a titanium/titanium nitride layer construction has generally been used as the barrier material. Also, tungsten is used as the bit line material. Here, titanium reacts with silicon exposed at the lower area during the subsequent thermal treatment to form titanium silicide (TiSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>), which improves the contact resistance, and the titanium nitride layer functions as a protecting layer for preventing the instability of interface by protecting the permeation of fluorine gas generated by the subsequent deposition process of tungsten, to the lower layer material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a conventional method for forming a bit line of a semiconductor is illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views for illustrating consecutive steps of a conventional method for forming a bit line of a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> first insulation layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a hole is formed to expose the substrate by removing a part of the first insulation layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A plug <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is then formed by filling up the hole with polysilicon, a second insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed on the first insulation layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> including the plug <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the upper side of the second insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is planarized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> trench is formed to form a bit line by etching the second insulation layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the plug <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> At this time, the width of line is about 0.20 &mgr;m to 0.25 &mgr;m of CD (critical dimension) in the case of using a DUV (Deep Ultraviolet) stepper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Here, to make the line narrower, a third insulation layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> forming a sidewall on the overall surface including the trench is thinly formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In that situation, the third insulation layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed by lower pressure deposition providing superior step coverage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C, a</cross-reference> photoresist <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is spread on the front surface of the third insulation layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and then the photoresist <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is patterned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>D, an etching process is performed by using the patterned photoresist <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as a mask, to form a contact hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>exposing the bit line contact <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The etching at this time is dry etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</cross-reference> shows a region designated &lsquo;A&rsquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference> in detail. After the bit line contact <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed, a cleaning process is performed to remove a natural oxide layer in the bit line contact <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Also, a barrier layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> composed of a titanium (Ti) layer and a titanium nitride (TiN) layer is formed on a front surface including the contact <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>in order to reduce the contact resistance of the bit line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> After that, a titanium silicide (TiSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed on the barrier layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by thermal treatment at high temperature, in order to minimize the contact resistance with respect to the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In such a situation, the titanium silicide layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed so as not to come into contact with an overhang area in the bit line contact <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F, a</cross-reference> tungsten layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed on the front surface including the titanium silicide layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G, a</cross-reference> bit line including of the barrier layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the titanium silicide layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and the tungsten layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed by a CMP (chemical-mechanical planarization) process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> However, in such a conventional method, to prevent the cohesion of TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>during the rapid thermal treatment at the temperature of 800&deg; C. to 850&deg; C., the titanium (Ti) layer and the titanium nitride (TiN) layer are deposited consecutively before the thermal treatment, and in such a situation, a micro crack is generated on the titanium nitride (TiN) layer by rapid thermal stress, and a defect may occur due to the fluorine gas used while tungsten (W) is being deposited. </paragraph>
