<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A torque receiving member is fixed to a rotary shaft of a compressor. A pulley, which is rotated by an external drive source, is rotatably supported by a housing of the compressor. The pulley is substantially coaxial with the torque receiving member. A rubber damper is located between the pulley and the torque receiving member. The rubber damper absorbs rotational vibration transmitted from the torque receiving member to the pulley. The pulley has a dynamic damper. The dynamic damper includes rollers, which swing like pendulums to reduce rotational vibration of the pulley. Stress produced due to displacement between the axis of the pulley and the torque receiving member is reduced by the rubber damper. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a rotary machine that includes a housing, a rotary shaft, which is rotatably supported by the housing, a first rotor, which is fixed to the rotary shaft, and a second rotor, which is rotatably supported by the housing. Specifically, the present invention pertains to a rotary machine that includes a first and second rotors, which are substantially coaxial and coupled to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For example, a typical vehicular compressor driven by an external drive source such as a vehicle engine has a first rotor, which is fixed to a rotary shaft for driving the compressor, and a second rotor, which is coupled to the first rotor and to the engine by a belt. Typically, the second rotor is rotatably supported by the housing of the compressor with a bearing. This structure reduces radial stress applied to the rotary shaft due to the tension of the belt. Accordingly, the stress received by the bearing supporting the rotary shaft is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-297844 discloses such a structure. The structure of the publication includes an inertial weight (second rotor) driven by an external drive source and a hub (first rotor) fixed to a crankshaft (rotary shaft). The inertial weight is coupled to the hub with an annular elastomer (damping member). The annular elastomer attenuates the rotational vibration transmitted from the crankshaft to the inertial weight. Further, the hub has a variable frequency vibration absorbing system. The system includes centrifugal weights, which swing like pendulums to reduce rotational vibration of the crankshaft. Accordingly, the resonance between the first rotor and the second rotor is suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> If the first rotor is fixed to a rotary shaft and the second rotor is rotatably supported by a housing, which supports the rotary shaft, the displacement between the axes of the first and second rotors needs to be absorbed (allowed). If there is no structure for absorbing the axial displacement, the durability of bearings supporting the rotary shaft and the durability of bearings supporting the second rotor are degraded. The structure of the publication No. 2000-297844 does not absorb such axial displacement. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a rotary machine that suppresses resonance between a first rotor and a second rotor and improves the durability of the rotary machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To achieve the foregoing and other objectives and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, a rotary machine driven by an external drive source is provided. The rotary machine includes a housing, a rotary shaft, a first rotor, a second rotor, a coupling member, and a dynamic damper. The rotary shaft is rotatably supported by the housing. The first rotor is fixed to the rotary shaft to rotate integrally with the rotary shaft. The second rotor is rotatably supported by the housing. The second rotor is substantially coaxial with the first rotor and is rotated by the external drive source. The coupling member couples the rotors to each other to transmit power from the second rotor to the first rotor. The coupling member includes a damping member. The dynamic damper is provided in at least one of the rotors. The dynamic damper has a weight that swings like a pendulum. The axis of the pendulum motion of the weight is separated by a predetermined distance from and is substantially parallel to the rotation axis of the corresponding rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.</paragraph>

The power transmission mechanism PT and the compressor form a rotary machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is coupled to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is located in the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> rotates integrally with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A cam plate, which is a swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, is housed in the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> slides along and inclines with respect to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is coupled to the lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by the hinge mechanism <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> permits the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to rotate integrally with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to incline with respect to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> while sliding along the rotation axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A snap ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fitted about the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> extends between the snap ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The snap ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> limit the minimum inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At the minimum inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the angle defined by the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is closest to ninety degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (only one is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are formed in the cylinder block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are located about the rotation axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A single-headed piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is reciprocally housed in each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The front and rear openings of each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are closed by the associated piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A compression chamber is defined in each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The volume of the compression chamber changes according to the reciprocation of the corresponding piston <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is coupled to the peripheral portion of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a pair of shoes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. When the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated by rotation of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the shoes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> converts the rotation into reciprocation of each piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The cylinder block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>), the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the hinge mechanism <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the pistons <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the shoes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> form a piston type variable displacement compression mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Sets of suction ports <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and suction valve flaps <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and sets of discharge ports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and discharge valve flaps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed in the valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Each set of the suction port <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the corresponding suction valve flap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and each set of the discharge port <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the corresponding discharge valve flap <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> correspond to one of the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (compression chambers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A suction chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are defined in the rear housing member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The front ends of the suction chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are closed by the valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As each piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> moves from the top dead center position to the bottom dead center position, refrigerant gas is drawn into the corresponding cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (compression chamber) through the corresponding suction port <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> while flexing the suction valve flap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to an open position. Low pressure refrigerant gas that is drawn into the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is compressed to a predetermined pressure as the piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is moved from the bottom dead center position to the top dead center position. Then, the gas is discharged to the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through the corresponding discharge port <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> while flexing the discharge valve flap <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to an open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The suction chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is connected to the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by an external refrigerant circuit (not shown). Refrigerant that is discharged from the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> flows into the external refrigerant circuit. The external refrigerant circuit performs heat exchange using the refrigerant. The refrigerant is drawn into the suction chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> from the external refrigerant circuit. Then, the refrigerant is drawn into each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be compressed again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A bleed passage <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed in the housing to connect the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with the suction chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed in the housing to connect the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A control valve <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is located in the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to regulate the opening degree of the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The opening of the control valve <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is adjusted to control the flow rate of highly pressurized gas supplied to the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The pressure in the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (crank chamber pressure Pc) is determined by the ratio of the gas supplied to the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the flow rate of refrigerant gas conducted out from the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the bleed-passage <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. As the crank chamber pressure Pc varies, the difference between the crank chamber pressure Pc and the pressure in the compression chambers varies, which changes the inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the stroke of each piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, or the compressor displacement during one rotation of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, is varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the cylindrical support <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> protrudes from the front wall of the front housing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and surrounds the front portion of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The axis of the circumference of the support cylinder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> substantially coincides with the axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A second rotor, which is the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, has a belt receiving portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A, about which the belt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is wound. The belt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> transmits power (torque) of the output shaft of the engine E to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> also has an inner cylinder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B.

That is, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported by the housing. Also, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> rotates relative to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is coaxial with those of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is located in the power transmission path between the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> functions as a coupling member for coupling the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to each other. The rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is elastically deformed to allow the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to move circumferentially and radially relative to the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Six weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (only one is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are formed in the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> between the belt receiving portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and the inner cylinder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B. The receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> function as receiving portions. The weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are angularly spaced at the constant intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> has a weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A.

Each weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A forms a part of an imaginary cylinder, the axis of which is parallel to the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The radius of the imaginary cylinder is represented by r<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, and the axis of the imaginary cylinder is spaced from the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by a distance R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A weight, which is a rigid roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, is accommodated in each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The diameter and the weight of each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are referred to as d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and m<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, respectively. Each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> rolls in the circumferential direction along the weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A of the corresponding weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. An annular lid <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is fixed to the front face of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by bolts. The lid <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> covers the weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to prevent the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from falling off the receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> When the compressor C is being driven by the engine E, or when the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is rotating, centrifugal force causes each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to contact the corresponding guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). If torque fluctuation is generated due to, for example, torsional vibrations of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> starts reciprocating along the guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A of the corresponding receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. In other words, each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> moves along the circumferential direction of the guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A. That is, each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, or the center of gravity of each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, swings like a pendulum about the axis of an imaginary cylinder that includes the corresponding guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A. That is, each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> acts as a centrifugal pendulum when the compressor C is being driven by the engine E. The size and mass of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the locations of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are determined such that the torque fluctuation is suppressed by pendulum motion of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (the weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>) and the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> form a dynamic damper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The settings of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which function as centrifugal pendulums, will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> suppress torque fluctuation when the frequency of the fluctuation is equal to the characteristic frequency of the roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (centrifugal pendulum). Therefore, the location, the size, and the mass of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are determined such that the characteristic frequency of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is set equal to the frequency of a peak component of the torque fluctuation. Accordingly, the amplitude of the peak component is suppressed, and the influence of the torque fluctuation is effectively reduced. A peak of the torque fluctuation represents a peak of the fluctuation range, or a rotation order component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The frequency of the torque fluctuation and the characteristic frequency of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are proportional to the angular velocity &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The frequency of the torque fluctuation when its range is the greatest is represented by the product of the rotation speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> per unit time (&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/2&pgr;) and the number N of the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. That is, the frequency is represented by the formula (&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/2&pgr;)&middot;N. Through experiments, it was confirmed that an nth greatest peak (n is a natural number) of the torque fluctuation has a value equal to a product n&middot;(&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/2&pgr;)&middot;N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The characteristic frequency of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is obtained by multiplying the rotation speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> per unit time (&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/2&pgr;) with the square root of the ratio R/r. The sign R represents the distance between the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (a rotor having weights that swing like pendulums) and the axis of the pendulum motion of each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (weight). The sign r represents the distance between the center of the pendulum motion of each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the center of gravity of the roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Therefore, by equalizing the square root of the ratio R/r with the product n&middot;N, the characteristic frequency of each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is equalized with the frequency of the nth greatest peak of the torque fluctuation. Accordingly, the torque fluctuation at the nth greatest peak is suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, to suppress the greatest peak of the torque fluctuations, the value of the signs R and r are determined such that the square root of the ratio R/r is equal to N, or the value of the product n&middot;N when n is one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The torque produced about the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is represented by a sign T. To effectively reduce peaks of the torque fluctuation by the pendulum motion of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the torques T need to counter the torque fluctuation and the amplitudes of the torques T need to be equal to the amplitude of the peaks of the fluctuation. When the frequency of the peak of the torque fluctuations is equal to the characteristic frequency of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the torque T is represented by the following equation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the equation 1, the sign m represents the total mass of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (m&equals;6m<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), and the sign &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>represent the average angular velocity of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> when the rollers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> swing in a minute angle &phgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the mass m is maximized to minimize the values R, r, and &phgr;, so that the size of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is minimized, and the torque T is maximized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The axis of each imaginary cylinder, which includes one of the guiding surfaces <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A, coincides with the axis, or the fulcrum, of the pendulum motion of the corresponding roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. That is, the distance R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>between the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the axis of each imaginary cylinder corresponds to the distance R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The distance between the axis of the pendulum motion of each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the center of gravity of the roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is equal to the value obtained by subtracting the half of the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from the radius r<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the corresponding imaginary cylinder. That is, the difference (r<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&minus;(d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/2)) corresponds to the distance r. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> To suppress the greatest peak of the torque fluctuation, the values of the distances R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, r<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, and the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>are determined such that the square root of R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/(r<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&minus;(d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/2), which corresponds to the square root of the ratio R/r, is equal to N, or the value of the product n&middot;N when n is one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The settings are determined by regarding each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> as a particle at the center of gravity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The operation of the compressor C will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the power of the engine E is supplied to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates integrally with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates, each piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> reciprocates in the associated cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by a stroke corresponding to the inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As a result, suction, compression and discharge of refrigerant gas are repeated in the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If the opening degree of the control valve <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is decreased, the flow rate of highly pressurized gas supplied to the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is decreased. Accordingly, the crank chamber pressure Pc is lowered and the inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is increased. As a result, the displacement of the compressor C is increased. If the opening degree of the control valve <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is increased, the flow rate of highly pressurized gas supplied to the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is increased. Accordingly, the crank chamber pressure Pc is raised and the inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is decreased. As a result, the displacement of the compressor C is decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> During rotation of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the compression reaction force of refrigerant and reaction force of reciprocation of the pistons <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are transmitted to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the hinge mechanism <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which torsionally (rotationally) vibrates the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The torsional vibrations generate torque fluctuation. The torque fluctuation causes the compressor C to resonate. The torque fluctuations also produce resonance between the compressor C and external devices (the engine E and auxiliary devices), which are connected to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by the belt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When the torque fluctuations are generated, the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> start swinging like pendulums. The pendulum motion of the <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> produces torques about the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The produced torques suppress the torque fluctuation. The characteristic frequency of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is equal to the frequency of the greatest peak of the torque fluctuations. Therefore, the peak of the torque fluctuations is suppressed, which effectively reduce the torque fluctuations of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Further, since the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is coupled to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) by the rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, torque fluctuation transmitted from the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is attenuated. As a result, the resonance produced by the torque fluctuations is effectively suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The rotation axes of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be displaced from each other. However, since the rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is located between the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>), stress applied to the radial bearings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A due to the displacement of the axes is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> functions effectively when the frequency of the torque fluctuation is relatively high. The rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> function effectively when the frequency of the torque fluctuation is relatively low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment has the following advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> (1) The rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are provided in the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> swings like a pendulum about its axis, which is spaced from the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by the predetermined distance R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and is parallel to the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The pendulum motion of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> suppresses the torsional vibration (the torque fluctuation), which suppresses resonance produced in the power transmission mechanism PT and the compressor C. Further, the pendulum motion suppresses resonance produced between the compressor C and the external devices that are coupled to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by the belt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is located in the power transmission path between the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is elastically deformed to allow the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to move circumferentially relative to the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which attenuates the torque fluctuation transmitted from the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. That is, in addition to the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> functions as a damper. Therefore, the resonance is effectively suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Since the structure for suppressing resonance is provided in the power transmission mechanism PT, the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> need not have any means for suppressing resonance. This reduces the weight and the size of the compressor C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> (2) Radial stress is applied to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> due to the tension of the belt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> coupling the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with the engine E. However, since the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is supported by the housing, radial stress applied to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> (3) The damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is located between the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, or in the power transmission path in between. The rotation axes of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) can be displaced from each other. However, since the rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is elastically deformed to allow the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to move radially relative to the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, deformation of the rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> reduces stress applied to the radial bearings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A due to the displacement of the axes. Therefore, the durability of the rotary machine, which includes the power transmission mechanism PT and the compressor C, is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> (4) The rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which are rigid cylinders, move along the arcuate weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A formed in the weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Since the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are not fixed to the fulcrum of the pendulum motion, the structure is simplified compared to a structure in which weights are fixed to the fulcrums. In a structure in which the weights are fixed to the fulcrums, the distance between each weight and the corresponding pendulum axis (fulcrum) varies due to space created between the fulcrum and the hole formed in the weight for receiving the fulcrum. The structure of the above embodiment has no such drawback. Therefore, the resonance is effectively suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the present invention will now be described. The second embodiment is the same as the first embodiment except for the structure of the power transmission mechanism PT. Mainly, the differences from the first embodiment will be discussed below, and same or like reference numerals are given to parts that are the same as or like corresponding parts of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment has a hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B. Compared to the first embodiment, the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B has a greater diameter and substantially covers the entire opening of each receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. In the second embodiment, the lid <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment is omitted. Instead, the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B prevents the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from falling off the receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, the rubber damper <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, which is located between the outer surface of the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B and the inner surface of the inner cylinder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B of the first embodiment, is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A damper receptacle <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed between each adjacent pair of the weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The front end of each damper receptacle <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is open. That is, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has the six damper receptacles <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A tubular elastic member (damping member), which is a rubber damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, is fitted in each damper receptacle <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> have circular cross-sections. The outer surface of each rubber damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> closely contacts the inner surface of the corresponding damper recess <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Each rubber damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a through hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A, the cross-section of which is circular. The hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B has power transmission pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> projecting rearward. Each pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> corresponds to one of the rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The rear end (right end as viewed in the drawings) of each pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is fitted in the through hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A of the corresponding damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Each pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is press fitted in a hole formed in the peripheral portion of the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B, and extends in the axial direction of the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The number of the pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is six in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Power transmitted from the engine E to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through the rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the power transmission pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the power transmission pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are located in the power transmission path between the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> attenuate the torque fluctuation transmitted from the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In addition to the advantages (1) to (4), the second embodiment has the following advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> (5) Each rubber damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is located between one of the adjacent pairs of the weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The spaces between the receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are effectively used for providing rubber dampers. The structure of the second embodiment reduces the axial size of the power transmission mechanism PT compared to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> (6) The hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B of the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> prevents the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from falling off the receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Therefore, there is no need for providing an additional member for preventing the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from falling, such as the lid <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment. This reduces the number of the parts and thus reduces the costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment of the present invention will now be described. The third embodiment is the same as the second embodiment except for the structures of the receptacles and the rollers and the location of the rubber dampers. Mainly, the differences from the second embodiment will be discussed below, and same or like reference numerals are given to parts that are the same as or like corresponding parts of the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the power transmission mechanism PT of the third embodiment has six receiving portions, which are weight receptacles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. An arcuate weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A is formed in each receptacle <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Each guiding surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A is a part of an imaginary cylinder the radius of which is larger than the radius r<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A in the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> An auxiliary guiding surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>B is formed in each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The auxiliary guiding surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>B is separated from the guiding surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A toward the axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by a predetermined distance and has an arcuate cross-section. As viewed from the front side of the compressor C, each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> appears as an arc having a constant width with its middle portion located closer to the periphery of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> than its ends. Also, as viewed from the front side of the compressor C, each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is symmetrical with respect to an imaginary line that contains the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the center of the corresponding imaginary cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A weight, which is a rigid roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, is accommodated in each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The diameter of each roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is slightly less than the distance between the guiding surfaces <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A and the auxiliary guiding surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>B. The axial dimension of the rollers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is slightly less than the depth of the receptacles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, or the dimension along the axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. That is, each roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can move along, or can swing like a pendulum in, the guiding surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A of the corresponding receptacle <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is located in the power transmission path between the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Also, each adjacent pair of the dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are located at the ends of the pendulum motion of one of the rollers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, or at the ends of the corresponding receptacle <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Part of each rubber damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is exposed in the corresponding receptacles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the receptacles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> form receiving portions. When the rollers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are moved by an excessive degree, the rollers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> contact the rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. That is, the rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> attenuate the torque fluctuation transmitted from the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and function as shock absorbing members for absorbing the shock due to collision of each roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with the corresponding receiving portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Each rubber damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is located between an adjacent pair of the receptacles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The outer surface of each damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is exposed in the corresponding receptacles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. That is, each damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can contact the rollers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the corresponding pair of the receptacles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (the weight receptacles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>), the rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and the rollers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> form a dynamic damper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In addition to the advantages (1) to (6), the third embodiment has the following advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> (7) The rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are located at the ends of the pendulum motion of each roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the receiving portions. Therefore, when each roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is moved by an excessive degree, the shock due to the collision of the roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the corresponding receiving portion is absorbed. This prevents the receiving portion and the roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> from being deformed or broken and suppresses noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> (8) The rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> attenuate the torque fluctuation transmitted from the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and function as shock absorbing members for absorbing the shock due to collision of each roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with the corresponding receiving portion. This structure facilitates creating of the spaces for the shock absorbing members and the damping members and reduces the number of the parts, which reduces the costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> (9) The shock absorbing member (each shock absorbing damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) is used for an adjacent pair of the receiving portions. This structure facilitates creating of the spaces for the shock absorbing member (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) and reduces the number of the parts, which reduces the costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Particularly, it should be understood that the invention may be embodied in the following forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A dynamic damper having weights that swing like pendulums may be provided in the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> instead of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, both of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may have the dynamic damper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, spherical weights may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the number of weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, in which the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are provided, may be changed. The number of the recesses need not correspond to the cylinder bores of the compressor C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the cross-sectional shape of each receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> along a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be circular. This facilitates machining of the receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the square root of the ratio R/r is equal to N, which is the value of n&middot;N when the n is one. However, the square root of the ratio R/r may be the value of n&middot;N when n is a natural number that is equal to or more than two (for example, two or three). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the ratio R/r, or the square root of the ratio R/r, of the weights (rollers) may be different. In this case, since there are two or more values that correspond to the ratios R/r, two or more peaks of the torque fluctuations are suppressed. In this case, the values of n are preferably selected from numbers in order from one. For example, when three numbers are selected, one, two and three are preferably used. Accordingly, the square roots of the ratios R/r correspond to the numbers represented by the products n&middot;N, in which n is one, two and three. Therefore, the two or more greatest peaks of the torque fluctuation are suppressed. That is, the resonance is effectively suppressed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a power transmission mechanism PT having a pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> according to another embodiment. The pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a dynamic damper having two values of the ratio R/r. Specifically, two receptacles <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and four receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are formed in the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The cross-section of the receptacles <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> along a plane perpendicular to the axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is different from that of the receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A of each receptacle <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> forms a part of an imaginary cylinder, the axis of which is parallel to the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The radius of the imaginary cylinder is represented by r<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and the axis of the imaginary cylinder is spaced from the rotation axis of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by a distance R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The values of R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and r<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the diameter d<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of a roller <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> accommodated in each receptacle <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are determined such that the value corresponding to the ratio R/r is different between the receptacle <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A is formed in each of the weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and each roller <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> swings like a pendulum along the corresponding guiding surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A. However, the pulley may have weights each of which is coupled to a fulcrum pin fixed to the pulley and swings like a pendulum. Alternatively, each weight may have a fulcrum pin, which is engaged with a hole formed in the pulley. In this case, each weight swings like a pendulum about the pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the settings are determined by regarding each weight as a particle at the center of gravity. However, the settings are preferably determined by taking the inertial mass of each weight into consideration. For example, in the case of the cylindrical rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the settings are preferably made based on the ratio 2R/3r instead on the ratio R/r to take the inertial mass into consideration. When the frequency of the peak of the torque fluctuation is equal to the characteristic frequency of the rollers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the torque T is represented by the following equation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> (Equation 2) </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T&equals;</italic></highlight>(3/2)&middot;<highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>&middot;(&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&middot;(<highlight><italic>R&plus;r</italic></highlight>)&middot;<highlight><italic>R&middot;&phgr;</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> If spherical weights are used, the settings are preferably made based on the ratio 5R/7r to take the inertial mass into consideration. When the frequency of a peak of the torque fluctuation is equal to the characteristic frequency of each spherical weight, the torque T is represented by the following equation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> (Equation 3) </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> If the weights are not formed cylindrical or spherical, the settings are preferably made by taking the inertial mass of the weights into consideration so that the resonance is effectively suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, each power transmission pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B with a tubular rubber damper. In other words, the power transmission pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may be coupled to both of the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B and the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with damping members such as rubber dampers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, each power transmission pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is fixed to the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B and coupled to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with the corresponding rubber damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. However, the pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may be fixed to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and coupled to the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B with rubber dampers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, the rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are tubular and have circular cross-section. However, the cross-section of the rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, a space may exist between the inner surface of each receptacle <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the corresponding rubber damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or between the inner surface of each rubber damper <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the outer surface of the corresponding power transmission pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. That is, narrow spaces may exist as long as the power transmitting performance and the durability of the power transmission mechanism PT are not adversely affected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the rubber dampers (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) are used. However, dampers made of elastomer may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, rubber dampers (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) are used as damping members. However, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by springs (damping members (elastic members)) such as metal springs. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> describes such an embodiment. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment are replaced with leaf springs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The leaf springs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> transmit power from the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the power transmission pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B is omitted for purposes of illustration. In the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> spring receptacle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is formed between each adjacent pair of the weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. A plurality of leaf springs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> are located in each spring receptacle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The rear portion of each power transmission pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is inserted in one of the spring receptacle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In each spring receptacle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, two of the rectangular springs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> are laminated and located at each side of the power transmission pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in the circumferential direction of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The ends of the springs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (the ends in the radial direction of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) are engaged with steps <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A formed in the inner wall of the spring receptacle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which prevents the power transmission pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> from moving toward the opposite side in the circumferential direction. The middle portions of the springs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> are elastically deformed by the power transmission pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, which absorbs the torque fluctuation transmitted from the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The friction between the laminated springs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> attenuates the torque fluctuation. The rotation axes of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be displaced from each other. However, deformation of the springs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the changes of the contact point between the springs <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> reduce stress applied to the radial bearings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A due to the displacement of the axes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, rubber dampers (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) are used as damping members. However, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by damping members having gel containers. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> describes such an embodiment. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the power transmission pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment, which are located between the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B, are replaced with power transmission projections <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and containers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The power transmission projections <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> project rearward from the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B. The pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is coupled to the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by the projections <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the containers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B is omitted for purposes of illustration. In the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> container receptacle <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is formed between each adjacent pair of the weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. A plurality of containers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are located in each container receptacle <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The cross-section of each power transmission projection <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> along a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is substantially rectangular. The rear portion of each projection <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is inserted in the corresponding container recess <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. In each container receptacle <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, a container <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is located at each side of the projection <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in the circumferential direction of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Each container <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> includes a bag-like member and gel, which is included in the bag-like member. In this structure, gel sealed in the gel containers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> attenuates the torque fluctuation transmitted from the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through the projections <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The rotation axes of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be displaced from each other due to errors. However, deformation of the gel containers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> reduces stress applied to the radial bearings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A due to the displacement of the axes. Instead of the gel containers, containers having fluid such as liquid or gas may be used as damping members. If fluid is used, the same advantages as the case where gel is used are achieved. However, gel attenuates vibration by a greater degree compared to fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The number of cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the compressor C may be changed. A typical compressor for a vehicular air conditioner has three to seven cylinder bores. If the number of the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is three, the fluctuation of torque transmitted between the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> due to rotational vibration produced in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is greater compared to a case where the number of the cylinders <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is four or greater. That is, in a rotary machine that has three cylinder bores, the dynamic dampers and the damping members of the illustrated embodiment effectively suppress resonance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, each shock absorbing members (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) need not be used for an adjacent pair of the guides. Each shock absorbing members may correspond to one of the guides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, the rubber dampers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> attenuate the torque fluctuation transmitted from the torque receiving member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and also function as shock absorbing members for absorbing the shock due to collision of each roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with the corresponding receiving portion. However, the damping members may be provided separately from the shock absorbing members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the shock absorbing members for damping shock due to collision between the guides and the weights may be provided at a position other than the ends of pendulum motion of each weight. For example, the shock absorbing members may be provided on any surface forming each receptacle (<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>). In the first embodiment, the shock absorbing members may be provided on a side of the lid <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> that faces the receptacles. In the second and third embodiments, the shock absorbing members may be located on a side of the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B that faces the receptacles. In these cases, rubber sheets or elastic coating may be used as the shock absorbing members. The shock absorbing members dampen the shock due to collision between the weights and the guides. The weights collide with the guiding surface (<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A) of the receptacles when, for example, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> suddenly starts rotating at a high speed. When the rotation speed of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is decreased while the weight contacts and is swinging like a pendulum along the guiding surface, the weight is separated from the guiding surface. At this time, the weight collides with the radially inner surface of the receptacle (for example, the auxiliary guiding surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>B). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the power transmission mechanism PT is used for the compressor C, which has the single headed pistons <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. However, the mechanism PT may be used for a compressor that has double-headed pistons. In this type of compressor, cylinder bores are formed on either side of a crank chamber and each piston compresses gas in one of the pairs of the cylinder bores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the cam plate (the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) rotates integrally with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. However, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be used in a compressor, in which a cam plate rotates relative to a drive shaft. For example, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be used in a wobble type compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be used in a fixed displacement type compressor, in which the stroke of the pistons are not variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the present invention is applied to a reciprocal piston type compressor. However, the present invention may be applied to rotary compressors such as a scroll type compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the second rotor is the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. However, a sprocket or a gear may be used as the first rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the present invention is applied to the compressor C. However, the present invention may be applied to any apparatus that has a rotary shaft coupled to the power transmission mechanism PT, and torsional vibration is produced in the rotary shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The axis of the pendulum motion of each weight need not be parallel to the rotation axis of the rotor in which the weights are located. Specifically, the axis of the pendulum motion may be inclined relative to the rotation axis of the rotor in a range in which the maximum torque fluctuation is suppressed by a desirable degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the present examples and embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalence of the appended claims. </paragraph>
