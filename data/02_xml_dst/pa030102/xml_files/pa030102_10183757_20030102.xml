<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In a molding process, a hybrid integrated circuit substrate is positionally fixed in a horizontal direction. By abutting the points, where particularly leads having a spacing kept constant continue with a first connection portion, against guide pins provided on a mold die, a hybrid integrated circuit substrate can be positionally fixed. Because the spacing between the particular leads is not relied upon the number of terminals of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate, the mold can be commonly used where the number of terminals is different. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of, and more particularly to a manufacturing method of hybrid integrated circuit device having a resin seal body formed on a hybrid integrated circuit substrate by transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, there are, principally, two methods of sealing employed for hybrid integrated circuit devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The first method employs member having such a form as placing a lid, generally called a case member, on a hybrid integrated circuit substrate mounted with circuit elements of semiconductor chips or the like. This structure includes a hollow structure or that having a resin separately filled therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The second method is injection molding as a process to mold semiconductor ICs. This is described, e.g. in Japanese Patent Publication No. H11-330317. The injection molding generally uses thermoplastic resin. For example, the resin heated at 300&deg; C. is injected under a high injection pressure and poured into a mold at one time, whereby the resin is molded. Since a resin polymerization time is not required after pouring a resin into a mold, there is a merit to shorten the operation time as compared with transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Explanation will be made on a method of manufacturing a conventional hybrid integrated circuit device using injection molding, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> First, an aluminum (hereinafter, referred to as Al) substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is employed as a metal substrate as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in order for explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The Al substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is anodized in its surface. Furthermore, a resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having an excellent insulation property is formed on the entire surface of the anodized Al substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, the oxide may be omitted where voltage resistance is not taken into consideration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B and 13C</cross-reference>, a resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by a support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a thermoplastic resin. Namely, a substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mounted on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is covered with thermoplastic resin by injection molding. The support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the thermoplastic resin have an abutment region. The abutment region of support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fused by the poured hot thermoplastic resin, thereby realizing a full-mold structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Herein, the thermoplastic resin adopted is a resin called PPS (polyphenyl sulfide). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The injection temperature of thermoplastic resin is as high as 300&deg; C. Consequently, there is a problem that solder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> be fused by the hot resin thereby causing poor soldering. For this reason, an overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed by potting a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) in a manner previously covering solder joints, metal fine wires <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, active elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and passive elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Due to this, the fine wires (approximately 30-80 &mgr;m) particularly are prevented from being fallen down and broken under an injection resin pressure during forming with a thermoplastic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed through two stages shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B and 13C</cross-reference>. In the first stage, a gap is provided at between a backside of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a mold die. The support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is placed on the backside of the substrate, in consideration of securing a thickness at a backside of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> upon poring a resin under a high pressure into the gap. In the second stage, the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mounted on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is covered with a thermoplastic resin by injection molding. In the abutment region between the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the thermoplastic resin, the abutment region of the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fused by the poured hot thermoplastic resin thereby realizing a full-mold structure. Herein, the thermoplastic resin on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>preferably has an equivalent thermal expansion to that of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Next, explanation will be made on a conventional method of manufacturing a hybrid integrated circuit device using injection molding, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a flowchart, including a metal substrate preparing process, an insulating layer forming process, a Cu foil pressure-laying process, a partial Ni plating process, a Cu foil etching process, a die bonding process, a wire bonding process, a potting process, a lead connection process, a support member attaching process, an injection mold process and a lead cutting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C show the sectional views of the processes. Note that the processes, that are apparent without showing, are omittedly shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At first, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference> show a metal substrate preparing process, an insulating layer forming process, a Cu foil pressure-laying process, a partial Ni plating process and a Cu foil etching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the metal substrate preparing process, prepared is a substrate in consideration of its property of heat dissipation, substrate strength, substrate shield and the like. This example uses an Al substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a thickness, e.g. of approximately 1.5 mm, excellent in heat dissipation property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Next, a resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> excellent in insulation property is further formed over the entire surface of the aluminum substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. On the insulating resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a Cu conductor foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pressure-laid to constitute a hybrid integrated circuit. On the Cu foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an Ni plating <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided over the entire surface in consideration of adhesion to a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> electrically connecting between the Cu foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a lead-out electrode and an active element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a known screen-printing is used to form Ni plating <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a conductive path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</cross-reference> shows a die bonding process and a wire bonding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> On the conductive path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the preceding process, an active element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a passive element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are mounted through a conductive paste such as a solder paste <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby realizing a predetermined circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference> show a potting process, a lead connection process and a support member attaching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, in the potting process, prior to a later injection mold process, potting is previously made with a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) onto the solder junctions, metal fine wires <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, active elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and passive elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, thereby forming an overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Next, prepared is an outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for outputting and inputting signals from and to the hybrid integrated circuit. Thereafter, the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected to the external connection terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed in a peripheral area of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through a solder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected with the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the like is mounted on a support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. By mounting the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, it is possible to secure a thickness of a resin seal body at a backside of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during injection molding as explained in the next process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</cross-reference> shows an injection mold process and a lead cutting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figure, after potting is done with a thermosetting resin on the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form a overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by injection molding. At this time, in the abutment region between the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the thermoplastic resin, the abutment region of the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fused by the injected hot thermoplastic resin and turned into a full-mold structured resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Finally, the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is cut to a use purpose thereby adjusting the length of the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> By the above process, a hybrid integrated circuit device is completed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the semiconductor industry, it is a general practice to carry out a transfer mold process. In a hybrid integrated circuit device by the conventional transfer molding, a semiconductor chip is fixed on a leadframe, e.g. of Cu. The semiconductor chip and the lead are electrically connected through a gold wire (hereinafter, referred to as Au). This is because the impossibility of employing an Al fine wire in respect of ready bendability and time-consumed bonding requiring ultrasonic waves. Consequently, there has not conventionally existed a hybrid integrated circuit device that is formed by one metal plate to have a circuit formed thereon and further the metal substrate wire-bonded by Al fine wires is directly transfer-molded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In a hybrid integrated circuit device of an injection mold type, there has been a need to prevent the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from being bent or broken under an injection pressure during molding, and the solder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from flowing at a temperature upon injection molding. For this reason, in the conventional structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> due to potting has been adopted in order to cope with the foregoing problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> However, because injection molding is carried out after potting a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) to form an overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, there is a problem of consuming a material cost for thermosetting resin together with operation cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in the hybrid integrated circuit device by the conventional transfer molding using a leadframe, a semiconductor chip or the like is fixed on an island. Accordingly, although the heat generated from the semiconductor chip or the like dissipates at the fixing region, there is a problem that there is a limitation in heat dissipating area resulting in poor heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because the wire bonding within the resin seal body uses Au wires resistive to resin injection pressure as noted above, it is not a current practice to carry out transfer molding with using Al fine wires. The Al fine wire is readily bent due to the causes of a weak neck resulting from ultrasonic bonding and further too low elastic modulus to withstand under injection pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the case of integrally molding hybrid integrated circuit substrates by transfer molding, it is necessary to fix a position of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate in horizontal and thickness directions within the mold cavity. However, there is a problem that, in case a fixing pin is abutted against a back surface of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate to thereby carry out positioning, the substrate after packaging is exposed at its back surface thus incurring the deterioration in dielectric strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a problem to be solved by the present invention is to fix a hybrid integrated circuit substrate in a predetermined position within a mold in a transfer mold process. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the foregoing problem, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor circuit device comprising: a step of preparing a hybrid integrated circuit substrate insulation-treated al least in a surface thereof; a step of forming a conductor pattern on the substrate; a step of mounting a semiconductor or passive element on the conductor pattern; a step of electrically connecting a lead to the substrate; and a step of molding a thermosetting resin to at least a surface of the substrate by transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the invention is characterized in that, in a step of molding, a spacing between particular leads of the leadframe soldered on the hybrid integrated substrate is given constant so that the particular leads can be abutted at portions continuing to the connection portion provided at lead end against guide pins provided on the mold die. This makes it possible to positionally fix the leadframe and further the hybrid integrated circuit substrate, thus solving the conventionally encountered problem. Furthermore, by positionally fixing the hybrid integrated circuit substrate, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate can be covered, at its back surface, with using a resin having high heat dissipation property, thus improving the heat dissipation property for the hybrid integrated circuit device.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Explanation will be now made on a hybrid integrated circuit device according to a first embodiment of the invention with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, a structure of the hybrid integrated circuit device will be first explained. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> employs a substrate excellent in heat dissipation property in consideration of the heat generation of from the semiconductor chips fixed on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This embodiment explains a case using an aluminum substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Note that, although the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the embodiment uses an aluminum (hereinafter, referred to as Al) substrate, this is not necessarily limited to. For example, the embodiment is to be realized in case the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> uses a printed substrate, a ceramic substrate, a metal substrate or the like. The metal substrate may use a Cu substrate, an Fe substrate, an Fe&mdash;Ni substrate, an AlN (aluminum nitride) substrate or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The Al substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is anodized in its surface, to further form an insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> excellent in insulation, e.g. epoxy resin, over the entire surface thereof. Note that this metal oxide may be omitted without problem where voltage resistance is not considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> On the resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by a Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). An epoxy resin, for example, is overcoated to protect the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the Al substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, in a position except for electrical connection points. On the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, small-signal transistor or IC, and a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such as a chip resistor or chip capacitor, are mounted through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, a predetermined circuit is realized. Herein, by providing electrical connection using an Ag paste or the like, soldering may be partly omitted. In the case of mounting face up an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as a semiconductor chip, connection is through a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. For a power semiconductor chip, the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> uses an Al wire having approximately 150-500 &mgr;m&PHgr;, for example. This is generally called a thick wire. For a semi-power or small-signal semiconductor chip, used is an Al wire having approximately 30-80 &mgr;m&PHgr;, for example. This is generally called a fine wire. An external connection terminal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, in a peripheral area of the Al substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, is connected with an outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of Cu or Fe&mdash;Ni through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a resin seal body is directly formed over active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and Al wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the like on the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Namely, in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the thermosetting resin for use in transfer molding has a low viscosity and a cure temperature lower than a melting point of the solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> used in the connection member, e.g. 183&deg; C. This can eliminate the overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> formed by potting a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) required on the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As a result, in case thermosetting resin is poured directly over the metal fine wire having a diameter, e.g. of approximately 40 &mgr;m, electrically connecting the small-signal IC or the like to the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>during transfer molding, there is no possibility of falling down, disconnection or bending. A feature of the present invention is that the Al fine wire is prevented from being bent during the molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> extend externally of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are adjusted in length in compliance with the purpose of use. Holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed as traces of pushpins in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, at two points close to a side opposite to a side the outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> extend. The holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are caused by pushpins <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) fixing the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> during transfer molding, which are left even after forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed in a peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, i.e. in a region not formed with a circuit or the like on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, because the holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed in the peripheral region of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> over the resin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, it is structurally free from problem in respect of quality and moisture resistance. Herein, the peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is a margin provided to secure a distance from a circuit area upon individually pressing the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, a conductive paths <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is densely formed on the Al substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. On the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, mounted are an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, small-signal transistor or IC, and a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such as a chip resistance or capacitance through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or the like. Meanwhile, outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are connected through external connection terminals <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, thereby realizing a predetermined circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figure, a complicated circuit is formed within a narrow space on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. According to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, after forming an insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> over the entire surface of the Al substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a complicated circuit is formed and thereafter outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are bonded to the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, followed by integrally, directly forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the conventional, where forming a hybrid integrated circuit device by transfer molding, a leadframe of Cu, for example, is worked by etching, punching or pressing to form wiring, lands and the like. It has been impossible to form such a complicated circuit as a conductor pattern of a hybrid integrated circuit. Meanwhile, with a leadframe for transfer molding, when forming a wiring as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, there is a need of fixing with suspension leads at various points in order to prevent against lead warpage. In this manner, a hybrid integrated circuit using a usual leadframe can mount several active parts at the utmost. Thus, there is a restriction in forming a hybrid integrated circuit having such a conductor pattern as that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Namely, by providing a structure of hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, a substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a complicated circuit can be formed by transfer molding. Furthermore, because the invention uses a substrate having a high thermal conductivity to carry out transfer molding, the heat generated can be dissipated at the entire of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as compared to the hybrid integrated circuit device using the conventional leadframe, the metal substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> directly molded acts as a large-sized heat-sink thus providing excellent heat dissipation and realizing circuit characteristic improvement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Next, explanation will be made on a method of manufacturing a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B. Note that, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B, the processes, that are apparent without showing, are omitted in the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a process flowchart, including a metal substrate preparing process, an insulating layer forming process, a Cu foil pressure-laying process, an Ni partial plating process, a Cu foil etching process, a die bonding process, a wire bonding process, a lead connection process, a transfer mold process, and a lead cutting process. As apparent from the flow, it is a conventional practice to form a resin seal body by injection molding. The invention, however, has realized a process to form a resin seal body by transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The first process of the invention includes preparing a metal substrate, forming an insulating layer, pressure-laying a Cu foil and carrying out Ni plating, as show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the metal substrate preparing process, a substrate is prepared taking into consideration the properties of heat dissipation, substrate strength, substrate shield and so on. In this case, emphasis is placed particularly on heat dissipation property because heat concentration is caused by density increase where densely mounting integrating power transistors, large-scaled LSIs, digital signal processing circuits, etc. on one small-sized hybrid IC. The present embodiment explains the case using an Al substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a thickness of, e.g. approximately 1.5 mm, that is excellent in heat dissipation property. Although this embodiment explains the case using an Al substrate as the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, there is no especial limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> For example, the present example can be realized by using, as the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a print substrate, a ceramic substrate, a metal substrate or the like. It is possible to consider, as a metal substrate, a Cu substrate, an Fe&mdash;Ni substrate or a chemical substance of a metal excellent in conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Next, the aluminum substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is anodized to cause an oxide in its surface. Furthermore, a resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> excellent in insulation property, e.g. epoxy resin, is formed on the entire surface thereof. Note that the metal oxide may be omitted without problem where voltage resistance is not taken into consideration. Then, a Cu conductor foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is pressure-laid on the insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, to constitute a hybrid integrated circuit. On the Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, Ni plating is provided over the entire surface in consideration of an adhesion to a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for electrical connection between the Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for turning into an lead-out electrode and the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The second process of the invention includes forming partially Ni plating by etching and etching the Cu foil as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> On the Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, resist is left only in an area requiring Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by known screen-printing or the like to form a selective mask. Then, Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by etching, e.g. in an area for turning into an lead-out electrode, on the Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the resist is removed away. Again, resist is left only in an area requiring a Cu-foil conductor pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by known screen-printing or the like to form a selective mask. Then, a conductor pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed from Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on the insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by etching. Thereafter, a resin coat formed of an epoxy resin is applied on the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by screen-printing, for example. The resin coat is not applied on a region for electric connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The third process of the invention includes carrying out die bonding and wire bonding, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> On the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the preceding process, an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, a small-signal transistor or IC, and a passive element such as a chip resistor or a chip capacitor, are mounted through a conductive paste, such as a solder paste <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thereby realizing a predetermined circuit. Herein, by providing electrical connection with an Ag paste or the like, solder may not be partly employed. Meanwhile, when mounting an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as a power transistor or a semi-power transistor, a heat-sink is provided between the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in consideration of heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Next, in the case of mounting face up an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as a semiconductor chip, electrical connection is made through a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> by bonding. As noted above, the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for electrical connection between the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is wire-bonded through the Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, in consideration of an adhesion to the Cu-foiled conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Herein, the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> employs especially an Al fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Because an Al wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is difficult in forming a true-sphere ball, a stitch bonding scheme is employed. However, the stitch bonding is featured that a stitch point is readily broken by a resin stress and low in elastic modulus as compared to an Au wire thus readily fallen down under resin pressure. Accordingly, where using an Al wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, caution must be paid especially during forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The fourth process of the invention includes carrying out connection with leads as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, prepared is an outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for outputting and inputting signals from and to the foregoing hybrid integrated circuit. The outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is formed of a conductive material of Cu, Fe&mdash;Ni or the like for use as an output/input terminal. Furthermore, the width and thickness of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is determined by taking into consideration a current capacity and the like. In the embodiment of the invention, the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> requires strength and springiness although the detail will be explained in the next transfer mold process. Herein, prepared is an outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of an Fe&mdash;Ne material having a thickness of approximately 0.4-0.5 mm, for example. Thereafter, the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected to an external connection terminal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> formed in a peripheral region of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. At this time, the connection member is not necessarily limited to solder but connection can be possible by spot welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Herein, according to the invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, in that the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected somewhat obliquely relative to a mount surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, connection is made at approximately 10&deg; between a substrate back surface and a back surface of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Also, the solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, for connection between the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the external connection terminal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, has a melting point higher than a cure temperature of a thermosetting resin to be used in the next transfer mold process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The fifth process of the invention includes carrying out transfer molding as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B. This process integrally covers the hybrid integrated circuit substrate with a thermosetting resin <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> by transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In order to integrally mold the hybrid integrated circuit substrates by transfer molding, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> must be fixed in position within a mold cavity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. However, because integrally resin-molding the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> including a back surface thereof, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> must not be abutted directly against a lower mold die in the present invention. For this reason, the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is given with an angle as noted before. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, by a pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is structurally provided and fixed with a space in a back thereof. Similarly to this, adopted is a leadframe to be commonly used even where the number of pins differs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Specifically, at first, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> soldered with the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is transported to the mold dies <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, the lead frame <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> at particular points are put into abutment against guide pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> thereby horizontally fixing the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in position (herein in lengthwise and widthwise directions with respect to the page of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>). Furthermore, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> urges a peripheral point <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> thereby positionally fixing the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in a thickness direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the leadframe has a plurality of leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> each interconnected at two points of the first connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and second connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to be held as a frame. Meanwhile, the number of leads extended out of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is different depending upon the scale of an electric circuit to be formed on a surface of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Nevertheless, particular leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for abutment against the guide pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are necessarily provided in order to fix the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in its horizontal position. The spacing between those is constant based on a substrate size. Accordingly, in the case that the number of leads is changed by the scale of an electric circuit to be formed on the substrate surface, the number of the other leads than the leads for abutment against the guide pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is increased and decreased. For this reason, the leadframe takes a structure that arbitrary points of leads are not present depending upon a scale of a circuit to be formed on the substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected to the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> not in parallel therewith but having an upward inclination. This allows the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be positionally fixed in a thickness direction by the utilization of an elasticity of the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, as will be hereinafter referred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The guide pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are projections provided on the lower mold die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A, 6B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, the guide pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> include the guide pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for abutment against the connection points at between particular leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a first connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and the guide pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>for abutment at an outer side against the first connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Namely, by putting the four guide pins into abutment against particular points of the leadframe, the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> can be positionally fixed in the horizontal direction. Consequently, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is also fixed in the horizontal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, where transfer-molding a hybrid integrated circuit substrate different in output/input terminal count, the mold dies and guide pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be commonly used because the particular leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are spaced constant to eliminate the leads between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, pushpins <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are provided on the upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, wherein the leadframe <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is soldered, with an upward inclination, to the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Consequently, in case the upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the lower mold die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are fitted together as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is urged down by the pushpins <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> into a position parallel with a bottom surface of the lower mold die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. This fixes the position of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate in a thickness direction within the mold cavity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, thermosetting resin is injected through a gate <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> into the mold cavity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> such that it first hits a side surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The thermosetting resin injected as shown at an arrow <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is caused to flow branching toward the above and the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, as shown at an arrow <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. At this time, because the flow width <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> toward the above of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided nearly equal to the flow width <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> toward the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the thermosetting resin is allowed to smoothly flow toward the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Particularly, because resin is first filled at the backside of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, there is no possibility for the hybrid integrated circuit substrate to incline downward. Furthermore, the thermosetting resin is reduced in its injection velocity and pressure by being hit on the side surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is possible to prevent against the effect of bending or breakage of the Al fine wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> From the above, the present process can carry out integrally transfer mold after positionally fixing the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> within the mold cavity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. There is no movement of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> under an injection pressure of thermosetting resin <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, with the thermosetting resin having high heat conductivity, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be molded at its back surface to a constant thickness. It is thus possible to manufacture a hybrid integrated circuit device excellent in voltage resistance and heat dissipation property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, connecting the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, small-signal transistor or IC, the passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such as a chip resistance or chip capacitance, and the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, has a melting point higher than a melting point of the thermosetting resin. Thus, there is no occurrence of remelting and deviation in fixing position due to the heat of upon transfer molding without protection with a potted resin <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) required in the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the second connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the leadframe serves to prevent the thermosetting resin from flowing to the outside of the mold during transfer molding. Consequently, immediately after transfer molding is completed, the resin molded has a continuing region to the second connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The sixth process of the invention includes cutting the leads as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The resin, leaked through a thickness of the outer lead from the mold dies <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> during the preceding transfer mold process, is dammed by the second connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed on the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, and then cured as it is. Namely, leaked resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> fills between the leads of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in an area closer to the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> than the second connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. However, in the structure, no resin flows to between the leads of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in an area closer to a tip than the second connection portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> By punching away the second connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the leaked resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is simultaneously removed. By adjusting the length of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in accordance with a use purpose, e.g. by cutting the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> at a dotted-lined position <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, individual leads are made independent for use as input/output terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> By the above process, a hybrid integrated circuit device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, a particular lead is put into abutment against a guide pin provided on a mold die in a transfer mold process thereby carrying out positional fixing of a hybrid integrated circuit device within the mold. Due to this, the manufacturing method of hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention can omit the placement of a support member required in the conventional manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device. Furthermore, it is possible to greatly improve the heat dissipation property of a completed hybrid integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention and manufacturing method thereof, although explained on the full-mold type hybrid integrated circuit device, is not limited to the foregoing embodiment. For example, it is possible to form a hybrid integrated circuit device having a form entirely exposed in the back surface of a hybrid integrated circuit substrate. In this case, besides the effect noted above, an effect of heat dissipation property can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present embodiment, although explained on the case with one-sided lead having outer leads extending at one surface of the substrate, is not limited to this structure. With both-sided leads or four-way leads, besides the above effect, furthermore a transfer mold process can be realized in a state the substrate is stabilized. Besides, various modifications are possible within a range not departing from the gist of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, where the lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not used as a terminal for electric signals, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, the leads directed from the second connection portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>toward the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As explained above, the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention provides the following excellent effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> By placing a point connecting between a particular lead and a connection portion into abutment against a guide pin provided on a mold die in a molding process, a hybrid integrated circuit substrate connected to the leadframe can be positionally fixed within a mold cavity and then integrally transfer-molded with a thermosetting resin. Due to this, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate can be molded, at its back surface, in a constant thickness with the use of a thermosetting resin excellent in heat conductivity, whereby a hybrid integrated circuit device can be fabricated that is excellent in heat dissipation property. Also, by providing a spacing of the leads for abutment against guide pins irrespectively of the number of terminals of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate, the mold die can be commonly used where transfer-molding a hybrid integrated circuit substrate different in terminal count. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, by providing a connection portion to a region the leadframe is to be abutted against the upper and lower mold dies, it is possible to prevent a thermosetting resin from leaking through a gap between the leads to the outside of the mold during the molding process. Also, by making the connection portion length constant irrespectively of the terminal count on the hybrid integrated circuit substrate, the mold can be commonly used where transfer-molding a hybrid integrated circuit substrate different in terminal count. </paragraph>
