<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In a manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, transfer molding is carried put by positioning a curved surface formed in a back surface of the substrate on a lower mold die side and a burr formed in a main surface of the substrate on an upper mold die side. This utilizes the curved surface to inject thermosetting resin in an arrow direction to pour the thermosetting resin through a below of the substrate. There are no broken fragments of burr in a thermosetting resin at the below of the substrate. As a result, a required minimum resin thickness is secured at the below of the substrate, thus realizing a hybrid integrated circuit device having a high voltage resistance, an excellent heat dissipation property and a high product quality. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hybrid integrated circuit device and manufacturing method thereof, and more particularly to a hybrid integrated circuit device having a resin seal body formed on a hybrid integrated circuit substrate by transfer molding and to a manufacturing method thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, there are, principally, two methods of sealing employed for hybrid integrated circuit devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The first method employs member having such a form as placing a lid, generally called a case member, on a hybrid integrated circuit substrate mounted with circuit elements of semiconductor chips or the like. This structure includes a hollow structure or that having a resin separately filled therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The second method is injection molding as a process to mold semiconductor ICs. This is described, e.g. in Japanese Patent Publication No. H11-330317. The injection molding generally uses thermoplastic resin. For example, the resin heated at 300&deg; C. is injected under a high injection pressure and poured into a mold at one time, whereby the resin is molded. Since a resin polymerization time is not required after pouring a resin into a mold, there is a merit to shorten the operation time as compared with transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Explanation will be made on a method of manufacturing a conventional hybrid integrated circuit device using injection molding, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> First, an aluminum (hereinafter, referred to as Al) substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is employed as a metal substrate as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, in order for explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The Al substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is anodized in its surface. Furthermore, a resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having an excellent insulation property is formed on the entire surface of the anodized Al substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, the oxide may be omitted where voltage resistance is not taken into consideration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> On the resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a conductive path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by a Cu foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. On the conductive path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an active element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, transistor or IC, and a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such as a chip resistor or chip capacitor, are mounted through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, a predetermined circuit is realized. Herein, by providing electrical connection using an Ag paste or the like, soldering may be partly omitted. In the case of mounting face up an active element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, such as a semiconductor chip, connection is through a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed by bonding. Further, an outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected with an external electrode terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and is exposed from the resin sial body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to exterior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Herein, the thermoplastic resin adopted is a resin called PPS (polyphenyl sulfide). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The injection temperature of thermoplastic resin is as high as 300&deg; C. Consequently, there is a problem that solder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> be fused by the hot resin thereby causing poor soldering. For this reason, an overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed by potting a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) in a manner previously covering solder joints, metal fine wires <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, active elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and passive elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Due to this, the fine wires (approximately 30-80 &mgr;m) particularly are prevented from being fallen down and broken under an injection resin pressure during forming with a thermoplastic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16B and 16C</cross-reference>, a resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by a support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a thermoplastic resin. Namely, a substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mounted on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is covered with thermoplastic resin by injection molding. The support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the thermoplastic resin have an abutment region. The abutment region of support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fused by the poured hot thermoplastic resin, thereby realizing a full-mold structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Next, explanation will be made on a conventional method of manufacturing a hybrid integrated circuit device using injection molding, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a flowchart, including a metal substrate preparing process, an insulating layer forming process, a Cu foil pressure-laying process, a partial Ni plating process, a Cu foil etching process, a die bonding process, a wire bonding process, a potting process, a lead connection process, a support member attaching process, an injection mold process and a lead cutting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C show the sectional views of the processes. Note that the processes, that are apparent without showing, are omittedly shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At first, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</cross-reference> show a metal substrate preparing process, an insulating layer forming process, a Cu foil pressure-laying process, a partial Ni plating process and a Cu foil etching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the metal substrate preparing process, prepared is a substrate in consideration of its property of heat dissipation, substrate strength, substrate shield and the like. This example uses an Al substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a thickness, e.g. of approximately 1.5 mm, excellent in heat dissipation property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Next, a resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> excellent in insulation property is further formed over the entire surface of the aluminum substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. On the insulating resin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a Cu conductor foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pressure-laid to constitute a hybrid integrated circuit. On the Cu foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an Ni plating <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided over the entire surface in consideration of adhesion to a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> electrically connecting between the Cu foil <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a lead-out electrode and an active element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a known screen-printing is used to form Ni plating <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a conductive path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</cross-reference> shows a die bonding process and a wire bonding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> On the conductive path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the preceding process, an active element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a passive element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are mounted through a conductive paste such as a solder paste <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby realizing a predetermined circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</cross-reference> show a potting process, a lead connection process and a support member attaching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A, in the potting process, prior to a later injection mold process, potting is previously made with a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) onto the solder junctions, metal fine wires <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, active elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and passive elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, thereby forming an overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Next, prepared is an outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for outputting and inputting signals from and to the hybrid integrated circuit. Thereafter, the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected to the external connection terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed in a peripheral area of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through a solder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>B, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected with the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the like is mounted on a support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. By mounting the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, it is possible to secure a thickness of a resin seal body at a backside of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during injection molding as explained in the next process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</cross-reference> shows an injection mold process and a lead cutting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figure, after potting is done with a thermosetting resin on the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form a overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by injection molding. At this time, in the abutment region between the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the thermoplastic resin, the abutment region of the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fused by the injected hot thermoplastic resin and turned into a full-mold structured resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Finally, the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is cut to a use purpose thereby adjusting the length of the outer lead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> By the above process, a hybrid integrated circuit device is completed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the semiconductor industry, it is a general practice to carry out a transfer mold process. In a hybrid integrated circuit device by the conventional transfer molding, a semiconductor chip is fixed on a leadframe, e.g. of Cu. The semiconductor chip and the lead are electrically connected through a gold wire (hereinafter, referred to as Au) . This is because the impossibility of employing an Al fine wire in respect of its less elasticity and ready bendability and time-consumed bonding requiring ultrasonic waves. Consequently, there has not conventionally existed a hybrid integrated circuit device that is formed by one metal plate to have a circuit formed thereon and further the substrate wire-bonded by Al fine wires is directly transfer-molded. Further, as well as a printed circuit board and a ceramic substrate, there has not conventionally existed a hybrid integrated circuit device having a substrate wire-bonded by Al fine wires directly transfer-molded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, in the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device formed by transfer molding, a resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by injection molding after a hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mounted on a support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Consequently, the insulating region at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be easily controlled to a thickness of approximately 0.5-1.0 mm, for example. Meanwhile, because the resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed after placing the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, it is not problematic whether the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is punched out at the main surface or back surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> However, when a resin seal body is directly formed over the hybrid integrated circuit substrate by transfer molding, there are cases that the burr formed is broken during transfer molding at a time of punching out the substrate. The fragments of burr will be contained in a resin seal body formed at the below of the substrate. Due to this, circuit voltage is applied onto the substrate, a high voltage of which is to be applied to the resin seal body at the below of the substrate. Thus, there has been a problem that the reliability on voltage resistance is unavailable on the resin seal body containing substrate burrs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in a hybrid integrated circuit device of a injection mold type, there is a need to prevent a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from being bent or broken under an injection pressure upon molding, or to prevent a solder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from flowing at the temperature during injection molding. For this reason, the conventional structure shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> has adopted a potted overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in order to cope with the above problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> However, potting is made with a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) to form an overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and thereafter injection molding is carried out. Accordingly, there is a problem of requiring material and operation cost in concerned with such thermosetting resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device by transfer molding, a semiconductor chip or the like is fixed on an island. Although the heat generated by the semiconductor chip or the like dissipates through a fixing region, there has been a problem that there is restriction in heat dissipation area thus resulting in poor heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as noted above, the Al fine wire is readily bent due to the causes of being ultrasonically bonded to have a weak neck and further less resistive to resin injection pressure because of its low elastic modulus. For this reason, it is a practice to use, as a metal fine wire, an Au wire resistive to resin injection pressure in the wire-bonding for a resin seal body. The transfer molding employing an Al wire is not in the current practice. It is, therefore, a problem of the present invention to provide a structure and manufacturing method realizing the transfer molding free from bending by actively employing such an Al fine wire. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Explanation will be now made on a hybrid integrated circuit device according to a first embodiment of the invention with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> (sectional view) and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B (plan view), and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> employs a substrate excellent in heat dissipation property in consideration of the heat generation of from the semiconductor chips fixed on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This embodiment explains a case using an aluminum substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Note that, although the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the embodiment uses an aluminum (hereinafter, referred to as Al) substrate, this is not necessarily limited to. For example, the embodiment is to be realized in case the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> uses a printed substrate, a ceramic substrate, a metal substrate or the like. The metal substrate may use a Cu substrate, an Fe substrate, an Fe&mdash;Ni substrate, an AlN (aluminum nitride) substrate or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is anodized in its surface, to further form an insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> excellent in insulation, e.g. epoxy resin, over the entire surface thereof. Note that this metal oxide may be omitted without problem where voltage resistance is not considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> On the resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by a Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). An epoxy resin, for example, is overcoated to protect the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by screen-printing. On the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, small-signal transistor or IC, and a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such as a chip resistor or chip capacitor, are mounted through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, a predetermined circuit is realized. Herein, by providing electrical connection using an Ag paste or the like, soldering may be partly omitted. In the case of mounting face up an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as a semiconductor chip, connection is through a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. For a power semiconductor chip, the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> uses an Al wire having approximately 150-500 &mgr;m&phgr;, for example. This is generally called a thick wire. For a semi-power or small-signal semiconductor chip, used is an Al wire having approximately 30-80 &mgr;m&phgr;, for example. This is generally called a fine wire. An external connection terminal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, in a peripheral area of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, is connected with an outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of Cu or Fe&mdash;Ni through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a resin seal body is directly formed over active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and Al wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the like on the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Namely, in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the thermosetting resin for use in transfer molding has a low viscosity and a cure temperature lower than a melting point of the brazing material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (e.g. solder) used in the connection member, e.g. 183&deg; C. This can eliminate the overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> formed by potting a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) required on the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As a result, in case thermosetting resin is poured directly over the Al fine wire having a diameter, e.g. of approximately 40 &mgr;m, electrically connecting the small-signal IC or the like to the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>during transfer molding, there is no possibility of falling down, disconnection or bending. A feature of the present invention is that the Al fine wire is prevented from being bent during the molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> extend externally of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are adjusted in length in compliance with the purpose of use. Holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed as traces of pushpins in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, at two points close to a side opposite to a side the outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> extend. The holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are caused by pushpins <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) fixing the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> during transfer molding, which are left even after forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed in a peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, i.e. in a region not formed with a circuit or the like on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, because the holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed in the peripheral region of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> over the resin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, it is structurally free from problem in respect of quality and moisture resistance. Herein, the peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is a margin provided to secure a distance from a circuit area upon individually pressing the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. In the event, the peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is a dead space, and the region is effectively used as a abutting region for the pin , thus there being a merit to effective use of mounting region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, a conductive paths <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is densely formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. On the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, mounted are an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, small-signal transistor or IC, and a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such as a chip resistance or capacitance through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or the like. Meanwhile, outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are connected through external connection terminals <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, thereby realizing a predetermined circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figure, a complicated circuit is formed within a narrow space on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. According to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, after forming an insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> over the entire surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a complicated circuit is formed and thereafter outer leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are bonded to the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, followed by integrally, directly forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, it is a practice to use a leadframe completely blanked through both of the surfaces. This is true for the leadframe to be etched. With a leadframe completely worked through the both surfaces, it is possible to make a single-structured TR leadframe or IC leadframe. However, a complicated circuit cannot be formed, e.g. hybrid integrated circuit conductive pattern. Meanwhile, in a leadframe for transfer molding, when forming thereon a wiring as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, there is a necessity of suspension leads fixing at various points in order to prevent lead warpage. In this manner, the hybrid integrated circuit using a usual leadframe can afford to mount thereon utmost several active parts. There is a limitation in forming a hybrid integrated circuit having a conductive pattern as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Namely, by providing a structure of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention (structure supporting a conductive pattern on a metal substrate), a substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a complicated circuit can be transfer-molded. Furthermore, because the invention uses, as the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a substrate having a high thermal conductivity, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the entirety can be utilized as a heat-sink to prevent the mounted elements from rising in temperature. Moreover, the heat generated is allowed to dissipate to the outside through the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as compared to the semiconductor device using the conventional transfer-molded leadframe, heat dissipation property is excellent because the metal substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is directly molded, thus realizing circuit characteristic improvement and size reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has a blanking surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a back surface and a conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the like formed on the opposite surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. On the blanking surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the opposite surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the substrate, a curved surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and a burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are respectively formed upon blanking the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed approximately 100 &mgr;m on a surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a thickness of 1.5 mm, for example. The burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is structurally weak in strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Herein, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention uses the surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having a burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as a surface of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Although the detail is referred later, the resin upon transfer molding is poured at the bottom of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This provides a structure that, despite the burrs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> caused upon transfer molding are spotted, these are not present in a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, circuit voltage is applied to the substrate. The hybrid integrated circuit is applied by a voltage, e.g. 500-700 V, wherein the equivalent voltage is applied to the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Although the hybrid integrated circuit device is to be mounted and used on a chassis or the like, this in this case forms a parasitic capacitance at between the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the chassis. In this case, in case there are burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>fragments in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as a conductor material reduces the parasitic capacitance. This results in quality deterioration in the hybrid integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> However, as noted above, the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention uses the surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having a burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as a surface of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This also is in a structure that the burrs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>if fragmented upon transfer molding are spotted are not present in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Due to this, the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention has a resin thickness serving for high voltage resistance at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This realizes a hybrid integrated circuit device excellent in product quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case of using the surface formed with the burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as a back surface of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, there is a possibility that the burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is crushed by the resin flow of upon transfer molding to exist in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has a thin-walled thickness of 0.5 mm, for example. Consequently, although the burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is approximately 100 &mgr;m, the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on the back surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> cannot secure its thickness at the burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> region. Due to this, high voltage resistance is lost in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, particularly at the burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, making impossible to secure product quality. As a result, the use of the surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having the burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as a surface of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> realizes an excellent hybrid integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, according to the invention, the thermosetting resin forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> uses a resin low in viscosity but high in fluidity. For this reason, the thermosetting resin adopted was that called an epoxy resin mixture. The thermosetting resin has been developed by placing attentions to the following point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> First, because a thermosetting resin is directly molded to a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, particularly Al wire having a diameter of approximately 40 &mgr;m, consideration is made on the effect of falling down the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> or breakage in the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Second, taking into account the dissipation of the heat generated by the hybrid integrated circuit including power transistors, etc. formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the outside of the hybrid integrated circuit device through the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, consideration is made on the thickness of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to be formed at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Third, consideration is made to shorten the operation time in forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by transfer molding, i.e. resin injection time and post-forming standing time for stabilizing resin property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Fourth, consideration is made on the voltage resistance and product reliability in use as a hybrid integrated circuit device for an application at high voltage resistance, e.g. 500-600 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The thermosetting resin of the invention will be explained with consideration to the above points. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, considered is a constituent material and property of the thermosetting resin. In the invention, silica is reduced in amount by about 20-40% as compared to the thermosetting resin in the conventional, in order to reduce the viscosity of the thermosetting resin. Specifically, the conventional has contained this approximately 2.0-2.5 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>in thermosetting resin. The invention contains it approximately 1.0-1.5 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>in thermosetting resin. Due to this, the spiral flow length in transfer molding can be greatly improved, i.e. from 40-60 cm of the conventional to 80-120 cm of the invention. Furthermore, the melt viscosity in transfer molding also can be greatly improved, i.e. from 40-60 Pa.s in the conventional to 4-10 Pa.s of the invention. As noted above, because of silica amount reduction, thermal conductivity somewhat lowers, i.e. from 1.5-2.5 W/m.&deg; C. in the conventional to 1.0-2.0 W/m.&deg; C. in the invention. However, by the large improvement in spiral flow and melt viscosity, the thickness of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate can be improved from 0.8 mm in the conventional to 0.5 mm in the invention. In conclusion, resin resistance can be improved by approximately 0.2-0.5&deg; C./W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In addition, a great effect is obtained by the change of silica from a spall form into a spherical form. In the conventional thermosetting resin, the spiral flow length upon transfer mold is 40-60 cm and problematic in viscosity wherein, at the same time, melt silica is in a spall form. Consequently, the spall-formed silica, particularly at its end, of thermosetting resin contacts a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> under an injection pressure during transfer molding, thereby falling down or breaking the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> However, the invention, changed melt-silica form into a spherical form, can reduce the melt-silica size itself and also remove the conventional spall-formed silica of an acute angle at an end of thereof. Specifically, the silica form in the conventional has a greatest diameter of approximately 40-60 &mgr;m although not to be definitely considered because of its spall form. However, the fused silica of the invention is spherical having a greatest diameter of approximately 30 &mgr;m. This can greatly reduce the affection of falling down, breakage and the like in the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> during transfer molding. Furthermore, by the size reduction of molten silica itself, resin can easily flow even to a thin-walled region of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as noted above, the invention can improve the thickness of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from 0.8 mm in the conventional to 0.5 mm in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the thermosetting resin of the invention is used by adding an ion trap agent in the thermosetting resin. As described above, because the transfer mold process carries out a molding process at a lower temperature as compared to the injection mold process, there is a case that the ions in a thermosetting resin catalyst is completely removed away. However, by previously adding an ion trap agent in the thermosetting resin, ions can be positively removed thereby preventing leakage at high voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the thermosetting resin of the invention has a glass transfer temperature of approximately 140-160&deg; C. Due to this, in a standing operation for stabilizing the resin property of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> after transfer molding, although the permissible storage temperature of the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the like mounted on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is for example 160&deg; C., operation can be carried out satisfying that condition. As a result, the thermosetting resin of the invention stabilizes in resin property, to realize a hybrid integrated circuit device satisfying the product quality of the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> or the like mounted on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows curability during transfer molding of the thermosetting resins of the invention and in the conventional. As shown in the third consideration point, it is targeted to shorten the operation time during forming by transfer molding, i.e. the resin pouring time and the post-forming standing time for stabilizing the resin property. As shown, the thermosetting resin of the invention, improved as above, can positively obtain hardness in a brief time and realize a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> stable in resin property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As noted above, according to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the thermosetting resin used in transfer molding has a low viscosity and a lower curing temperature than a melting point, e.g. 180&deg; C., of the blaze material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (solder or the like) used in the foregoing connecting member. This makes it possible to eliminate the overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> due to potting of a thermosetting resin (e.g. epoxy resin) as required in the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As a result, in case an Al fine wire, having a diameter of approximately 40 &mgr;m for electrical connection of a small-signal IC or the like with a conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, is directly poured with a thermosetting resin during transfer mold, there is no possibility of breakage or bending thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> covering the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided with a feature in order to prevent the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from warping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the invention, a thin-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having nearly the same length as the longer side of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed on a side of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> opposite to the side outer leads extend. Meanwhile, a resin injection port is provided on the side close to the thin-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is formed small in thickness at the upper, lower and side surfaces of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> corresponding to the thin-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. Also, the thin-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is somewhat provided in an area over the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is formed substantially thick in a device mounting region. There is a problem of a warp of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, generally, due to contraction upon curing the thermosetting resin. In the invention, this is solved by providing a thin-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>also in the upper of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Specifically, first, at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and its periphery, pouring and curing is earlier in time in the thin formed region and integrated with the substrate thereby coping with the warpage in the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Second, at the above of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a thin-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided vertically relative to a direction of warping up of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> so that the thin-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is cured earlier thereby coping with that. Third, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the surface of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at above the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has the surfaces defining various angles to the mount surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Consequently, by combining the surfaces, a side is formed to reduce the stress warping up the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, thereby being able to counter the stress warping up the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Namely, the above three structural features provide an effect to expand against the contraction of a thermosetting resin at the above of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> when the thermosetting resin is cured. This structure eliminates warp-up out of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, thus improving mountability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, although the thin-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also utilized in a transfer mold process, referred later, the detail of which will be described therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the invention, the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has thick-walled regions <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed, e.g. in a U-form, in a manner longitudinally sandwiching the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The U-formed thick-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has an upper surface having the same height as the upper surface of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Namely, the both have the equal thickness. However, the U-formed thick-walled region, narrow in width, has a feature of short cure time similarly to the thin-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Consequently, similarly to the thin-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, this can prevent against the warp up of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> when the thick-walled region in the above of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is cured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, when taken out of the mold and again annealed after transfer molding, is clamped at main and back surfaces of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by metal plates and simultaneously pressurized in order to suppress warp up. At this time, the U-formed thick-walled region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is flush with the surface of the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Because positive abutment can be made, a structure is realized that prevents against warp up of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As described above, besides, the invention is characterized by being covered by the integral resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> due to transfer molding. Due to this, although the resin seal body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device forms an abutment region at between the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the injected thermosetting resin, the present invention does not form such an abutment region thereby improving moisture resistance and eliminating the necessity of the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thus, it is possible to realize a hybrid integrated circuit device greatly reduced in material and operation cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, the resin for use in transfer molding has a low viscosity and a lower curing temperature than a melting point, e.g. 183&deg; C., of the solder used in the foregoing connecting member. Due to this, the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention can eliminate the overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> covering the active element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, passive element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, metal fine wire <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, solder joints <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the like in the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device, whereby a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can be formed directly on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As a result, it is possible to realize a hybrid integrated circuit device greatly reduced in material and operation cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention has an insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having approximately 40 &mgr;m formed on a conductor metal substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed by Cu foil on the insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Also, by virtue of grounded substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention can form a magnetic shield structure. Due to this, although the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention is to be set up and used on a chassis or the like, the radio wave generated outside the hybrid integrated circuit device is blocked by the substrate before intruding to the circuit on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As a result, there is no possibility of intrusion of the extrinsic noise caused outside the hybrid integrated circuit device. Thus, it is possible to realize a hybrid integrated circuit device greatly reduced in the erroneous operation on the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, explanation will be made on a method of manufacturing a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a process flowchart, including a metal substrate preparing process, an insulating layer forming process, a Cu foil pressure-laying process, an Ni partial plating process, a Cu foil etching process, a die bonding process, a wire bonding process, a metal substrate blanking process, a lead connection process, a transfer mold process, and a lead cutting process. As apparent from the flow, it is a conventional practice to form a resin seal body by injection molding. The invention, however, has realized a process to form a resin seal body by transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B show the sectional views of the processes. Note that the processes, that are apparent Without showing, are omitted in the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows process of preparing a metal substrate, forming an insulating layer, and pressure-laying a Cu foil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the metal substrate preparing process, a substrate is prepared taking into consideration the properties of heat dissipation, substrate strength, substrate shield and so on. In this case, emphasis is placed particularly on heat dissipation property because heat concentration is caused by density increase where densely mounting integrating power transistors, large-scaled LSIs, digital signal processing circuits, etc. on one small-sized hybrid IC. The present embodiment explains the case using an substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a thickness of, e.g. approximately 1.5 mm, that is excellent in heat dissipation property in consideration of the above point. Also, although this embodiment explains the case using an Al substrate as the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, there is no especial limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> For example, the present example can be realized by using, as the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a print substrate, a ceramic substrate, a metal substrate or the like. It is possible to consider, as a metal substrate, a Cu substrate, an Fe substrate, an alloy such as an Fe&mdash;Ni substrate or a AlN substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Next, the aluminum substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is anodized to cause an oxide in its surface. Furthermore, a resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> excellent in insulation property, e.g. epoxy resin, is formed on the entire surface thereof. Note that the metal oxide may be omitted without problem where voltage resistance is not taken into consideration. Then, a Cu conductor foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is pressure-laid on the insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, to constitute a hybrid integrated circuit. On the Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, Ni plating is provided over the entire surface in consideration of an adhesion to a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for electrical connection between the Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for turning into an lead-out electrode and the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows process of Ni plating and etching the Cu foil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> On the Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, resist is left only in an area requiring Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by known screen-printing or the like to form an anti-etching mask. Then, Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is selectively formed by etching, e.g. in an area for turning into an lead-out electrode, on the Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the resist is removed away. Again, resist is left only in an area requiring a Cu-foil conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by known screen-printing or the like to form an anti-etching mask. Then, a conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed from Cu foil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on the insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by etching. Thereafter, a resin coating is formed of an epoxy resin on the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by screen-printing, for example. This resin coating works as a protect film and is removed at a region for electrical connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> shows the processes of die bonding and wire bonding, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> On the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the preceding process, an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, a small-signal transistor or IC, and a passive element such as a chip resistor or a chip capacitor, are mounted through a conductive paste, such as a solder paste <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thereby realizing a predetermined circuit. Herein, by providing electrical connection with an Ag paste or the like, solder may not be partly employed. Meanwhile, when mounting an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as a power transistor or a semi-power transistor, a heat-sink is provided between the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in consideration of heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Next, in the case of mounting face up an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as a semiconductor chip, electrical connection is made through a metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> by bonding. As noted above, the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for electrical connection between the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is wire-bonded through the Ni plating <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on the conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in consideration of an adhesion to the Cu-foiled conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Herein, the metal fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> employs especially an Al fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Because an Al wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is difficult in forming a true-sphere ball, a stitch bonding scheme is employed. However, the stitch bonding scheme is featured that a stitch point is readily broken by a resin stress and low in elastic modulus as compared to an Au wire thus readily fallen down under resin pressure. Accordingly, where using an Al fine wire <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, caution must be paid especially during forming a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. As for the present invention, caution is paid where using the Al fine wire, detailed is referred later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a metal substrate blanking process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As explained to the preceding process, a conductive path <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to provide thereon an active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the like. Meanwhile, although the figure illustrates to form hybrid integrated circuit on one substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the same pattern of hybrid integrated circuits, e.g. two or four, is practically formed on one substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The first prepared substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>) is the one in a strip form blanked from one metal plate, taking account the size of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is already formed with a curved surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in a peripheral blanked surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figure, because the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> forms individual hybrid integrated circuit substrates, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is placed on a pedestal <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. At this time, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed with a peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> as a space where nothing is formed other than an insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. There is no possibility to break the already-formed hybrid integrated circuits because of placement at the peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on the pedestal <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the common substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is blanked by a punch <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> at a blanking surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to complete individual substrates <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In this blanking process, a curved surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is formed in the blanking surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> while burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed in a surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>opposite to the blanking surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> show a lead connection process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, prepared is an outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for outputting and inputting signals from and to the hybrid integrated circuit. The outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is formed of a conductive material of Cu, Fe&mdash;Ni or the like in order for use as an output and input terminals. Furthermore, the width and thickness of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is determined by taking a current capacity and the like into consideration. Although the detail will be explained in the next transfer mold process, the embodiment of the invention prepares an outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> having a thickness, for example, of approximately 0.4-0.5 mm because the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> requires strength and springiness. Thereafter, the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected to an external connection terminal formed in a peripheral region of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. At this time, connecting member is not necessarily limited to solder but connection can be by spot welding or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Herein, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, according to the invention, the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected at a somewhat angle, e.g. approximately 10&deg;, to a mount surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a thermosetting resin to be used in the next transfer mold process has a cure temperature lower than a melting point of a solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for connection between the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the external connection electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> shows a transfer mold process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> First explained is a lower mold die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>. The lower mold die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed with guide pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to positionally fix the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. As a result, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is fixed in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> connected with the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> formed in the preceding process is placed on the lower mold die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. By abutting the upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> against the lower mold die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> only is clamped to fix the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. At this time, because the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected, at a somewhat angle relative to horizontal, to the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at its tip rises toward the upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. However, the tip of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is fixed by a pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> provided in the upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be kept in a horizontal position, with a spacing at a backside, relative to the lower mold die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. At this time, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> fixes a peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As noted before, because the peripheral region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> has an insulating resin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or, as the case may be, overcoat resist covered on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> surface is prevented from being directly exposed from the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Then, resin is injected through a gate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> formed in the mold dies <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, to form a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> over the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by transfer molding. According to the invention, injection pressure is suppressed from 700-800 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in the conventional to 80-100 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in the invention as compared to the conventional injection mold process case, wherein, for example, resin injection temperature and mold temperature is kept at 160-180&deg; C., whereby thermosetting resin is directly molded over the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and Al fine wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> without providing a conventional overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). In this case, the gate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is formed in a position at a longer-side end face of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, herein a center in a side surface opposite to the side surface having the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. This allows an injection thermosetting resin to spread in every direction upon entering a cavity <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference>) through the gate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. As a result, the injection velocity of thermosetting resin is reduced thereby preventing the effect of falling down or breaking the Al fine wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case of forming a gate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in a position <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> corresponding to an end of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the thermosetting resin injecting through the gate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> into the cavity <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> spreads to the above and below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. However, differently from the foregoing case, the spreading region is narrow. As a result, because the thermosetting resin is not fully reduced in injection velocity, the phenomenon readily occurs of falling down or breaking the Al fine wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> rather than the case with the gate position <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, in the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, the thermosetting resin to be injected through the gate into the cavity <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is injected in a manner first hitting a side surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, as shown at an arrow <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The resin is injected through the above and below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, as shown at an arrow <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness of 0.5 mm, for example. At this time, as noted before, the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is fixed by the mold dies <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and further fixed by a pushpin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> formed in the upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Consequently, in order to form the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to a thickness, e.g. of 0.5 mm, there is resistance to the stress of at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. However, it is impossible to cope with the stress at the above of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, thermosetting resin must be poured at the below of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, according to the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, transfer molding is carried out by positioning a burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as explained in the metal-plate blanking process on an upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> side and a curved surface on a lower mold die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> side. In this case, because thermosetting resin is injected by the utilization of the curved surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, it is further poured to the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Due to this, because a resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is first formed at the below of the substrate, it is formed to an even thickness though the thickness is as thin as 0.5 mm. Also, the burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed approximately 100 &mgr;m in a surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a thickness, for example, of 1.5 mm. The burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has a structure having a weak strength. Consequently, although the burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is readily broken under a resin pressure in transfer molding, there is no possibility that fragmented burrs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>be contained in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the lower of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As a result, it is possible to realize a method of manufacturing a hybrid integrated circuit device having high voltage resistance, excellent heat dissipation property and high product quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, in the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, the thermosetting resin to be injected through the gate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> into the cavity <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is injected in a manner first hitting a side surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The thermosetting resin injected as shown at the arrow <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> flows branching to the above and below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. At this time, because the width of flow <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to the above of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the width of flow <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are provided nearly equal, the thermosetting resin is allowed to flow toward the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the velocity and pressure of thermosetting resin is reduced by once hitting at the side surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, to prevent the effect of bending or breakage in the Al fine wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In order to further reduce the injection velocity and pressure of the thermosetting resin flowing above the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as shown at the arrow <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the cavity <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is enlarged at the above of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> within the upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. As a result, the flow width <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of thermosetting resin at the above of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is broadened than the flow width <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> close to the gate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, to allow thermosetting resin to spread furthermore as at an arrow <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Thus, the injection velocity and pressure of thermosetting resin can be decreased at the above of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, in the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, a slant <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is formed in a runner upper part in an injection region of from the gate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> into the cavity <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Of the runner <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> width and the gate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> width, the gate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is narrower in width. Due to this, because the thermosetting resin is injected with inclination relative to the mount surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the thermosetting resin is moderated in flow toward the above of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and also allowed to flow to the below. As a result, the thin-walled region at the lower of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and its vicinity can be formed in early time, thereby suppressing the effect upon the Al fine wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Due to this, the thin-walled region is cured earlier during hardening. This acts as a support member to prevent the warp of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, as compared to the case of the conventional injection mold, the injection pressure is suppressed and a thermosetting resin is used as a resin so that thermosetting resin can be injected while being melted by keeping a resin injection and mold temperature at 160-180&deg; C. This reduces the injection pressure and makes the fused silica in thermosetting resin into a spherical form. It is accordingly possible to carry out molding of thermosetting resin directly onto the Al fine wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> without using resin potting for suppressing breakage or the like of the Al wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> including thin and thick wires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because the curing temperature of thermosetting resin is lower than a melting point of the solder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> connecting the active element <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> such as a power transistor, small-signal transistor or IC, a passive element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such as a chip resistance or chip capacitor, and outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, there is no possibility of deviation in mount position due to re-melting by the heat of upon transfer molding without the protection with an overcoat <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) due to the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a lead cutting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the resin, flowed through a thickness of an outer lead from the mold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> during the preceding transfer mold process, is dammed by the tie-bar <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed on the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, thus being cured as it is. Namely, leaked resin is filled at between the leads of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in an area closer to the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> than the tie-bar <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>thereof. However, there is structurally no resin leakage to between the leads closer to the tip of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> than the tie-bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The leaked resin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is removed simultaneous with punching away the tie-bar <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Also, in accordance with a use purpose, the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is cut, for example, at a position of a dotted line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to adjust the length of the outer lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, thereby being made into individual leads for serving as input/output terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> By the above process, completed is a hybrid integrated circuit device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> As described above, the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention carries out the transfer mold process by positioning the burr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>explained in the metal substrate blanking process on the side of the upper mold die <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the curved surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>on the side of the lower die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Due to this, the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be made evenly to a required minimum thickness. Also, there is no possibility for broken fragments of the conductive material substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to exist in the resin seal body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the below of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As a result, a manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device having high voltage resistance, excellent heat dissipation property and high product quality is realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention carries out blanking of a common substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> formed with a plurality of hybrid integrated circuits including conductive paths <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, active elements <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, passive elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the like, at the blanking surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, to form individual substrates <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Due to this, because the foregoing curved surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>can be formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, it is possible to favorably flow a therm-set resin during transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention was explained on the full-mold type hybrid integrated circuit device but is not limited to the above embodiment. For example, it is possible to form a hybrid integrated circuit device exposed in the entire back surface of the hybrid integrated circuit substrate. In this case, besides the foregoing effects, an effect of improved heat dissipation can be obtained furthermore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, although the present embodiment explained on the case with one-sided leads having outer leads extending at one side surface of a substrate, the invention is not limited to this structure. With both-sided or four-way leads, besides the above effect, a transfer mold process can be realized in a state of stabilizing a substrate. Besides, various modifications are possible within a range not departing from the gist of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> According to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, the hybrid integrated circuit substrate has, in its surface, a burr formed in the blanking process and, in its back surface, a curved surface formed in the blanking process. The bur is structurally weak in strength and ready to be broken under a resin injection pressure during transfer molding. However, the broken burr is structurally not existed in a resin seal body at the below of the substrate. Due to this, the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention has a required minimum resin thickness to provide high voltage registance at the below of the substrate. Also, a hybrid integrated circuit device can be realized that is excellent in product quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, the thermosetting resin to be used in transfer molding has a low viscosity and a cure temperature lower than a melting point, e.g. 183&deg; C., of the solder used in the connecting member. Consequently, the hybrid integrated circuit device can eliminate the overcoat resin covering the active element, passive element, metal fine wires, solder joints and so on of the conventional hybrid integrated circuit device. As a result, a hybrid integrated circuit device can be realized which has thermosetting resin directly covering the hybrid integrated circuit substrate and is greatly reduced the material and operation cost due to the conventional potting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, the thermosetting resin for forming a resin seal body uses a low viscous, fluid resin. In order to make the thermosetting resin low in viscous, the amount of silica is reduced by 20-40% as compared to the conventional thermosetting resin. This can greatly improve the spiral flow length upon transfer molding from 40-60 cm in the conventional to 80-120 cm in the invention. The melt viscosity upon transfer molding can be also greatly reduced from 40-60 Pa.S in the conventional to 4-10 Pa.S in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, fused silica is changed from the conventional spall form into spherical form. Due to this, by the size reduction of melt silica itself, the resin seal body at the below of the substrate can be formed small in thickness. As a result, realized is a hybrid integrated circuit device having high voltage resistance, excellent heat dissipation property and high product quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, the use of the thermosetting resin improves the thickness of the resin seal body at the below of the substrate from 0.8 mm in the conventional to 0.5 mm in the invention. Although this somewhat lowers heat conductivity due to the reduction in silica amount, the thickness of the resin seal body at the below of the substrate can be decreased. In conclusion, resin heat resistance can be improved by approximately 0.2-0.5&deg; C./W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, an ion trap agent is added to and used in the thermosetting resin. Due to this, because the transfer mold process carries out a mold process at a low temperature as compared to the conventional injection mold process, in the case of the ions in a thermosetting resin catalyst are not completely removed away, the ion trap agent added in the thermosetting resin can positively remove the ions, thereby preventing against the leakage at high voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> According to the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, the process for integrally molding a hybrid integrated circuit substrate by transfer molding is carried out by positioning a burr formed on the substrate on an upper mold die side and a curved surface on a lower mold die side. This can form a resin seal body at the below of the substrate to a required minimum thickness with evenness. Also, the broken fragments of the burr of conductive material are not existed in the resin seal body at the below of the substrate. As a result, realized is a method of a hybrid integrated circuit device having high voltage resistance, excellent heat dissipation property and high product quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, a substrate formed with a plurality of hybrid integrated circuits having conductive paths, active elements, passive elements and the like is blanked at its back surface to form the substrates. Because this can form a curve surface in a back surface of the substrate, thermosetting resin is allowed to favorably flow upon transfer molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the manufacturing method of a hybrid integrated circuit device of the invention, a substrate blanking process is carried out by abutting against a pedestal an outer periphery of the substrate not formed with the hybrid integrated circuit. This can form a curved surface in a back surface of the substrate without breaking the hybrid integrated circuit formed on the substrate. </paragraph>
