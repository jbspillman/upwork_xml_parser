<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the use of a sealing dielectric layer applied between a porous dielectric layer and a metal diffusion barrier layer. The sealing dielectric layer closes the pores on the surface and sidewalls of the porous dielectric layer. This invention allows the use of a thin metal diffusion barrier layer without creating pinholes in the metal diffusion barrier layer or without diffusion inside bulk of the porous material. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) metal barrier materials like TaN are used to prevent interconnect metals, in particular copper (Cu) from diffusing into the dielectric layer on semiconductor devices. The trend to scale down design rules has led to the requirement to start using dielectric layers with a dielectric constant (Dk) lower than 4-4.2 (what is typically achieved for PECVD oxide dielectric films). As the industry starts to use dielectric layers having lower Dk values a certain amount of porosity will be required to achieve the lower Dk value especially if films below a Dk of 2.6. (&ldquo;porous dielectric films&rdquo;) The Dk will depend on the amount of porosity and also on the resin nature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are two groups of low dielectric materials, the spin-on dielectrics and CVD dielectric materials. The spin-on dielectrics can be divided in two groups, the organic and the inorganic spin-on dielectric materials. The CVD dielectric materials currently use an organosilane/organooxysilane precursor as active agent in combination with an oxidation agent to generate a low-k dielectric film. Regardless of how the low Dk films are produced, the low Dk films have a certain amount of porosity or intramolecular spacing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The porosity in the low Dk films can cause problems with the metal diffusion barrier (e.g. the TaN layer) because there are pores inside and/or on top of the material. There is no difference between closed or open pore materials because closed pores will be etched open during the patterning of damascene structures. Both open and closed pore type of materials are sensitive to increased &ldquo;pinhole&rdquo; formation in the metal diffusion barrier sputtered layer on top of these patterns. The pinhole formation may lead to reliability problems and potential paths for diffusion and degradation of the metal interconnects and the dielectric. Because of this, a thick layer of metal diffusion barrier is required to seal the pores and to avoid &ldquo;pinholes&rdquo;. Another problem is that in the case of metal barrier formation by Atomic Layer Chemical Vapor Deposition (AL CVD), in an open pore the metal barrier will be deposited inside the bulk of the low dielectric. Amorphous dielectric materials do not result in pinholes or deposition of the metal diffusion barrier layer in the bulk porous material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the use of a sealing dielectric layer applied between the porous dielectric layer and the metal diffusion barrier layer. The sealing dielectric layer closes the pores on the surface and/or on the sidewall of the porous dielectric layer. This invention allows the use of thin metal diffusion barrier (e.g. TaN) layer without creating &ldquo;pinholes&rdquo; in the metal diffusion barrier layer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This invention pertains to the use of sealing dielectric layer having a composition of Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>(&ldquo;Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>film&rdquo;) where x has a value of 10 to 50, preferably 25 to 35 atomic percent, y has a value of 1-66, preferably 30-40 atomic % and z has a value of 0.1-66, preferably 25-35 atomic %; and x&plus;y&plus;z&gt;90 atomic %. The sealing dielectric layer is used to avoid the pinhole formation in a metal diffusion barrier and to avoid diffusion of metal atoms into a porous dielectric layer. The porous dielectric layer typically has a total porosity of 10 to 60% of the film where the connectivity of the pores is between 0 and 100%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The use of the sealing dielectric layer in forming the semiconductor device increases the number of process steps by 2 but the use of a cluster tool can make the approach more cost effective where a CVD and etch chamber are added to the sputtering or CVD/ALCVD metal barrier cluster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the sealing dielectric layer is typically 8-12 nm but can be between 1 and 50 nm. The thickness of the sealing dielectric layer will be dependent of the thickness of the metal diffusion barrier, which is dependent of the step coverage, and aspect ratio of the patterns and the nature of the porous dielectric layer. For example, if 10 nm Ionized Metal Plasma (&ldquo;IMP&rdquo;) PVD TaN is used then 10 nm of Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>is required in the case of a porous dielectric layer produced from hydrogen silsesquioxane resin according to U.S. Pat. No. 6,231,989. One skilled in the art will be able to readily determine the thickness of the sealing dielectric layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The integrated circuit subassemblies used in the process of this invention are not critical and nearly any which are known in the art and/or produced commercially are useful herein. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> represents a circuit assembly produced by single damascene technology. As can be seen in this figure, the sealing dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is sealing and covering the pores in the porous dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). If no etch/CMP stop (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and hard mask (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) are used then the sealing dielectric layer would also seal and cover the pores on the top surface of the porous dielectric layer. The horizontal sealing dielectric layers at the bottom and the top of the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A) are removed and the metal diffusion barrier (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) is then applied over the sealing dielectric layer within the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). The metal wiring (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), in this case copper (Cu) is then added into the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) to fill the opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another layer may then be formed by covering the metal wiring (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) with a metal wiring barrier (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). Metal wiring barrier layers (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) are known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,818,071, hereby incorporated by reference discloses metal wiring barrier layers of amorphous silicon carbide. The porous dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is applied over the metal wiring barrier (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). An optional etch/CMP stop (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and hard mask (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) are applied over the porous dielectric and interconnect openings are thereafter formed by removing the etch/CMP stop (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and sacrificial hard mask (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the porous dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and the metal diffusion dielectric barrier (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) down to the metal wiring (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) of the previous layer. The sealing dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is then applied. The sealing dielectric layer at the top and the bottom of the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A) are removed and the metal diffusion barrier (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) is then applied over the sealing dielectric layer within the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). The metal wiring (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), in this case copper (Cu) is then added into the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) to fill the opening. The layering process is repeated until the desired number of layers has been formed. FIG. (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) represents two single damascene levels where one level is completely processed including filling by the metal wiring (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and chemical mechanical polish (CMP). The processing is limited on the top level to patterning and the deposition of sealing dielectric layer (e.g. Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>) (e.g. interconnect openings (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) are not formed in the top layer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> represents a dual damascene structure, independent of the patterning approach (via first, partial via, trench first, dual hard mask patterning, etc.) that can be applied. As can be seen, the porous dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is sealed and covered by the sealing dielectric (Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>) layer (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), to seal the pores in the sidewalls of the porous dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and to avoid pinhole formation in the metal diffusion barrier layer (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), not shown. The sealing dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) will also avoid in case a CVD or ALCVD metal diffusion barrier (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) is deposited that metal will penetrate through the pores when they are connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 a</cross-reference> partial cross section of a device formed using subtractive A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> technology. When subtractive technology is used the sealing dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) can be applied to seal the pores of the porous dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the wall of the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) (via wall) to avoid pinholes in the metal diffusion barrier layer (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) (e.g. sputtered Ti or Ti/TiN layer). The pinholes in the metal diffusion barrier (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) may lead to interaction of WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>with Ti in case W plug technology is applied to form the via metal (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). The technology is also applicable for hot aluminum to achieve a reliable flow of the interconnect metal. The interconnect metal will not flow well if Ti is not covering the sidewall and bottom of the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The sealing dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) will cover the bottom of the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) for all <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> described devices. The bottom of the sealing dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A) can be removed by using sputtering or etching like a soft sputter etch or dry etching so a good contact is made between all metal interconnects. This means that the sealing dielectric layer (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) can be removed from on top of the porous dielectric layer and in the bottom of the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). There may more materials removed on the top than in the bottom of the interconnect opening (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). For example, some of the hard mask (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) may be removed due to A/R depended effects during sputtering or etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> This invention is not intended to be limited to the application of the sealing dielectric layer in the described structures. Alternative structures where a Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>film provides sealing of patterned structures in an integrated circuit may also be used herein. It is also applicable for flat panel displays (FPD), microsystem and optical devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The material used for the metal wiring layer is not limited to copper or aluminum interconnects. Additionally, the metal wiring layers can be silver, gold, alloys, superconductors and others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The dielectric sealing layer on integrated circuit subassemblies are generally used together with a metal diffusion barrier depending of the type of interconnect structure and/or metal that is used. Methods for depositing the sealing dielectric layers are known in the art. The specific method utilized is not critical. Examples of such processes include plasma enhanced vapor deposition (PECVD), low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), sub atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (SACVD), chemical vapor deposition techniques such as conventional CVD, photochemical vapor deposition, electron cyclotron resonance (ECR), jet vapor deposition, etc. and a variety of physical vapor deposition techniques such as sputtering, electron beam evaporation, etc. These processes involve either the addition of energy (in the form of heat, plasma, etc.) to a vaporized species to cause the desired reaction or the focusing of energy on a solid sample of the material to cause its deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Materials suitable for forming the Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>sealing dielectric layers are also known in the art. The precursor may be a single compound that provides the Si, C, and H elements for example, an alkyl silane, silacyclobutane or a polycarbosilanes. Or the precursor can be a mixture of compounds to provide the Si, C, and H elements, for example, silane, and an organic compound (e.g. methane). Preferably the precursor is an alkylsilane, more preferably trimethylsilane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Oxygen is not being intentionally added into the Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>film however, it is known that small amounts of oxygen can be present in the Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it is anticipated that a sealing dielectric layer having the composition of Si<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>where a has a value of 10 to 33, preferably 18 to 20 atomic %, b has a value of 1 to 40, preferably 18 to 21 atomic percent, c has a value of 1 to 66, preferably 31 to 38 atomic % and d has a value of 0.1 to 60, preferably 25 to 32 atomic %; and a&plus;b&plus;c&plus;d&gE;90 % atomic %; and C/Si&lt;0.5 and H/C&gt;0.5 would be useful herein. Si<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>films have a lower dielectric constant layers and thus reduce any negative impact on the effective dielectric constant. Or the sealing dielectric layer it can be can be comprised of layers of Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>and Si<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>to assure no degradation to the porous material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> To produce a sealing dielectric layer having the composition of Si<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>a controlled amount of oxygen may be present in the deposition chamber. The oxygen may be controlled by the type of oxygen providing gas used, or by the amount of oxygen providing gas that is used. If too much oxygen is present in the deposition chamber a silicon oxide film with a stoichiometry close to SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>will be produced and the dielectric constant will be higher than desired and the sealing properties will not be achieved without degrading the porous dielectric layer. Oxygen providing gases include, but are not limited to air, ozone, oxygen, nitrous oxide and nitric oxide, preferably nitrous oxide. The amount of oxygen providing gas is typically less than 5 volume parts oxygen providing gas per volume part of silicon containing compound, more preferably from 0.01 to 4.5 volume parts of oxygen providing gas per volume part of silicon containing compound. One skilled in the art will be able to readily determine the amount of oxygen providing gas based on the type of oxygen providing gas and the deposition conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In addition to the oxygen providing gas, oxygen may be introduced by the use of silicon containing compounds that contain oxygen, for example, 2,4,6,8-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane, 2,4,6,8,10-pentamethylcyclopentasiloxane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it is anticipated that a sealing dielectric layer having the composition of Si<highlight><subscript>e</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>h </subscript></highlight>where e has a value of 10 to 33, preferably 18 to 20 atomic %, f has a value of 1 to 50, g has a value of 1 to 66, preferably 31 to 38 atomic % and h has a value of 0.1 to 60, preferably 25 to 32 atomic %; e&plus;f&plus;g&plus;h&gE;90 atomic %; and C/Si&lt;0.5 and H/C&gt;0.5 would be useful herein.

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Silicon containing compounds useful in producing the sealing dielectric layer include, but are not limited to silanes, organosilanes, polycarbosilanes, cyclic siloxanes, and linear siloxanes. Useful silicon containing compounds are disclosed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,742, herein incorporated by reference for it&apos;s teaching of silicon containing compounds. The silicon containing compounds typically contain a unit having the formula R&mdash;Si where the R group is selected from a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom, a fluoro substituted organo group, or an organo group. R is preferably an alkyl group, more preferably a methyl group.
