<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a disposable diaper for absorption and containment of body wastes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Japanese Utility Model Application No. 1983-22908A discloses an open-type disposable diaper in which its rear waist region is provided in its transversely middle zone with an adhesive tape attached to an outer surface of a backsheet. The adhesive tape extends rectilinearly in a longitudinal direction of the diaper. The adhesive tape has its inner surface fixed at its lower end to the backsheet and coated at its upper end with adhesive. The diaper folded with bodily discharges can be rolled-up and held by the adhesive tape in this rolled-up state. The above-cited Publication illustrates an embodiment in which the upper end of the adhesive tape extends outwardly beyond the waist zone and another embodiment in which the upper end lies inside the absorbent pad&apos;s peripheral edge without extending outwardly beyond this peripheral edge into the waist zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 1996-10305B discloses a pants-type disposable diaper in which its rear waist region is provided at its transversely middle zone with a tape fastener folded up in its longitudinal direction and attached in this folded-up state to an outer surface of the backsheet so that the longitudinal direction of this tape fastener may be vertically oriented. Being unfolded, a free end portion of the tape fastener serving as a fastening portion extend sufficiently beyond a peripheral edge of the waist-opening to hold the diaper in a rolled-up state without anxiety that the rolled-up diaper might be opened again. The above-cited Publication illustrates an embodiment in which the tape fastener is folded back in a Z-shape, i.e., in three sections and another embodiment in which the tape fastener is folded back in four sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the examples of well known diaper as have been described above, both the adhesive tape and the tape fastener have respective lower ends fixed to the backsheet and respective upper ends in a form of free ends extending upwardly of the diaper from the fixed lower ends. It is not apprehended that these adhesive tape and tape fastener might be peeled off from the backsheet so far as these adhesive tape and tape fastener are linearly pulled in an opposite longitudinal direction thereof from the lower ends toward the upper ends. However, if they are pulled in the counter direction, i.e., from the upper ends toward the lower ends, a peeling force is generated between the adhesive tape or the tape fastener and the backsheet, under which the adhesive tape or the tape fastener may be easily peeled off from the backsheet. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to improve a diaper of prior art as has been described above so that an adhesive tape used to roll up a disposable diaper for its disposal is not easily peeled off from the diaper even if the adhesive tape is pulled upward or downward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, there is provided a disposable diaper having a body facing surface and a garment facing surface comprising an adhesive tape provided on the garment facing surface for holding the diaper in a rolled-up state for disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The adhesive tape comprises a first tape and a second tape attached onto the garment facing surface and aligned on an identical straight line. The first tape is folded back in two sections and overlaid so that opposite ends of the first tape point to one direction of the straight line and the two sections defining a first inner tape section lying on the side of the garment facing and a first outer tape section overlaid on the first inner tape section from outside. A surface of the first inner tape section opposed to the garment facing surface is fixed, in a vicinity of the end of the first inner tape section, to the garment facing surface and spaced, in a vicinity of a fold contiguous to the first outer tape section, from the garment facing surface. The first outer tape section is coated, at least partially on its surface opposed to the first inner tape section, with an adhesive so as to be temporarily fixed to at least one of the first inner tape section and the garment facing surface in such a manner as to be released. The second tape is folded back in two sections and overlaid so that opposite ends of the first tape point to an opposite direction of the straight line and these two sections and overlaid defining a second inner tape section lying on the side of the garment facing surface and a second outer tape section overlaid on the second inner tape section from outside. The second tape section is at least partially interposed, in the vicinity of the fold of the first tape, between the first tape and the garment facing surface. The second inner tape section is fixed to the garment facing surface opposed thereto and the second outer tape section is fixed to the first inner tape section opposed thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of this invention, Gurley&apos;s stiffness of the first and second tape sections is in a range of 0.1-1 mN/25.4 mm as measured by the method A prescribed in Section 6.20 of Japanese Industrial Standards L 1096, and the first tape is elastically stretchable in its longitudinal direction.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Details of a disposable diaper according to this invention will be more fully understood from the description given hereunder in reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A disposable diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a pants-type one shown in a partially cutaway perspective view viewed from its backside. The diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a liquid-pervious topsheet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> facing a wearer&apos;s body of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, defining an inner side of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a liquid-impervious backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> facing the wearer&apos;s garment, defining an outer side of the diaper, and a liquid-absorbent core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> interposed between these two sheets <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is composed of a front waist region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a rear waist region <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a crotch region <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, covering front, rear and crotch areas of the wearer&apos;s torso. The front and rear waist regions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> have transversely opposite side edge portions, respectively, which are joined together at bonding spots <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> arranged intermittently in a vertical direction along these side edge portions. The core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> extends upward from the crotch region <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to its upper ends <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> extend in a waist-surrounding direction in the front and rear waist regions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, respectively. The diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has, in addition, a waist-hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a pair of leg-holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Portions of the top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extending outwardly beyond peripheral edges of the core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of respective peripheral edges of the waist- and leg-holes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are overlaid and bonded together so as to form flaps <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Waist-surrounding elastic members <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and thigh-surrounding elastic members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are disposed in the flaps <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, respectively, in circumferential directions. These elastic members <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are secured in a stretched state to the inner surface of at least one of the top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the rear waist region <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is attached to the outer surface of the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on a center line C-C bisecting a width of the rear waist region <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the waist-surrounding direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line C-C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, where the upper side of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown in the left side of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and downside of the diaper is shown in the right side of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is attached to the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the rear waist region <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at a position lower than that of (rightward as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) the upper end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also) and in such region where the top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> overlaid. This adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> really consists of a fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> wherein the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is folded back so that its opposite ends <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may point to an upward direction (leftward as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> also is folded back so that its opposite ends <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may point to a downward direction (rightward as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> serves as a finger grip when this tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is unfolded as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> folded back in this manner consists of an inner tape section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> lying on an outer surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> facing the wearer&apos;s garment (not shown) and an outer tape section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> overlaid on the inner tape section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from outside wherein these tape sections <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are contiguous to each other along a fold <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The inner tape section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprises a fixed portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> existing in the vicinity of the end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a deformable portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> lying below (rightward as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) the fixed portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and extending to the fold <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> wherein the fixed portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is firmly secured to the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by means of an adhesive <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The deformable portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is a portion of the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which turns around together with a second coupling section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> lying below, as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, as the fastening taper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is pulled to a direction indicated by an arrow A with the end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> held by fingers (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Except for the vicinity of the end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the fold <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the outer tape section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is coated on its inner surface facing the inner tape section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with an adhesive <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The inner surface of the inner tape section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which comes in contact with the adhesive <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is coated with a release agent (not shown) so that the adhesive <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be easily released. The outer tape section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is temporarily fixed to the inner tape section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in such a manner as to be released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has a first coupling section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> lying on the outer surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a second coupling section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> placed upon the first coupling section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> from outside wherein these two coupling sections <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are contiguous to each other along a fold <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. This reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is interposed, at least in the vicinity of the fold <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, between the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the deformable portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the inner tape section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> constituting the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The first coupling section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is fixed to the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by means of an adhesive <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the second coupling section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is fixed to the deformable portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the inner tape section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by means of an adhesive <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In such a state as both the deformable portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the second coupling section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are fixed as has been described above, the deformable portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be releasably bonded, in the vicinity of the fold <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, to the first coupling section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or the outer surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>a of the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to avoid a possibility that the deformable portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> might be peeled off from the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the fold <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> during use of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> after the outer tape section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has been peeled off from the inner tape section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by pulling the outer tape section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow A with the end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> held by fingers. With the outer tape section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> pulled as shown, the second coupling section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> extending rightward as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> swings leftward, i.e., turns around together with the outer tape section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and extends in the same direction as that in which the outer tape section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends. The end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shifts from its position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> leftward by a distance corresponding to the length of the second coupling section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as the second coupling section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> turns around. In the case of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as illustrated, the end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shifts from its initial position rightward with respect to the upper end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the position above the flap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, at which the end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extends upward beyond the upper end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of which the second coupling section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has turned around extends rather rectilinearly in a vertical direction. Even if the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is further pulled with its end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> held by fingers, the tensile force is exerted on the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, but does not act on the fixed portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Such behavior of the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is effective to prevent the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from moving to a position as indicated by imaginary lines and thereby to prevent a peeling force from acting upon the adhesive <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the fixed portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In this way, it is unlikely that the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> might be peeled off from the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a rolled-up state using the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having been folded with bodily discharges is rolled-up and held in this state before its disposal in a manner as follows. First, the flap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is folded along the upper end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in a direction indicated by an arrow B and then the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having the adhesive <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is firmly wound around the regions of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such as the crotch region <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the front waist region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> while the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is rolled-up. Disposal of the used diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in this state is preferable from a hygienic point of view. Specifically, even if the used diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is taken off by tearing along the side edges of the front and rear waist regions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> joined together at the bonding spots <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, there is no anxiety that the folded regions of the used diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> might be exposed when it is disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> attached to the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is appropriately folded during use of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to avoid that the tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> might cause any interference and, for disposal of the used diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is conveniently unfolded so as to be elongated upwardly of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by a dimension corresponding to the length of the second coupling section <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. When the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is elongated, the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> functions to prevent the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from peeled off from the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. To assure such preventive effect, the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are dimensioned so that a relationship of Q/(P &plus;Q)&equals;0.1-0.6, more preferably, 0.2-0.5 may be established where P represents a dimension of the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and Q represents a dimension of the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the dimension P is a length from the end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the inner tape section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> constituting the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the fold <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the dimension Q is a length of the first coupling section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> constituting the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Plastic film may be used as a material for both the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to form the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> using plastic film which is elastically stretchable in the longitudinal direction of this fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In combination with such fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, it is preferred to use the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> formed by a plastic film having a stiffness higher than that of the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and being well resistant to the formation of fine wrinkles. Such a combination is advantageous in that, in the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> fixed to the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> temporarily fixed to the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by means of the adhesive <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>might be peeled off from the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the fold <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Additionally, it is unlikely that this fold <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> might be peeled off from the back sheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during use of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore the fold <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> will not get stuck on the clothes of the wearer of the diaper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a view similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> showing another preferred embodiment of this invention. In this case, the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is provided in at least one of the front and rear waist regions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (the rear waist region <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in this illustrated embodiment) with a plurality of elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> extending across the core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and secured in tension in the waist-surrounding direction thereto. These elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are interposed between the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or, if the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprises two or more sheets, between these sheets and contraction of these elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> works to bring the core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in close contact with the wearer&apos;s skin of the diaper. Contraction of these elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> tends to give a plurality of fine wrinkles on the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. However, it is preferred to take some appropriate measures to prevent formation of such fine wrinkles extending to the position of the tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> when the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is attached to the backsheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of or immediately above the elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. To achieve the desired effect, this invention uses, as a material for the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as a well as the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a plastic film having a Gurley&apos;s stiffness of 0.1-1 mN/25.4mm as measured by the method A prescribed by Section 6.20 of Japanese Industrial Standards L 1096. The Gurley&apos;s stiffness is measured on the film coated with the adhesive. It should be understood that the adhesive is coated with talcum powder before the film is set on the stiffness tester. The film having a stiffness in a range as has been described above can maintain its surface flat in spite of the presence of the elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and there is no anxiety that the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> temporarily bonded to each other by means of the adhesive <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>might be separated from each other during use of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Obviously, such film is free from the formation of the fine wrinkles due to contraction of the waist-surrounding elastic members <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the thigh-surrounding elastic members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Without departing from the scope of this invention, the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as well as the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be formed by two or more sheets of film having different characteristics, respectively, instead of forming each of the fastening tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the reinforcing tape <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> using a single sheet of film as is illustrated in the embodiments. While the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has been illustrated as a single tape placed on the center line C-C, it is possible without departing from the scope of this invention to provide an appropriate number of the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> at an appropriate location or locations on the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with an appropriate orientation. This invention is applicable also to an open-type diaper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The disposable diaper according to this invention, the adhesive tape used to roll up the diaper to dispose of comprises the fastening tape and the reinforcing tape. The fastening tape is folded back in two sections and fixed to the outer surface of the diaper only at the end of the inner tape section. The reinforcing tape is folded back in two sections in the direction opposite to the direction in which the fastening tape is folded back. The second coupling section of the reinforcing tape is fixed to the fastening tape in the vicinity of the fold of the inner tape section and the first coupling section of the reinforcing tape is fixed to the outer surface of the diaper. This unique arrangement ensures that the adhesive tape is not peeled off from the diaper even if the outer tape section of the fastening tape is pulled with a considerably strong tensile force in order to use this adhesive tape. </paragraph>
