<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a projector for displaying digital images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Photography is a popular pastime, and digital photography, in which digital cameras capture photographs electronically without the need for photographic film, is increasingly gaining in popularity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Enjoyment is to be gained by many users of digital photography from showing their family and friends photographs they have taken. Photographs intended for such exhibition might be photographs taken on holiday or at a family occasion such as a birthday party, or they might be amusing or embarrassing photographs of friends and family members which one would like to exhibit to others at a party. Some of the existing methods for showing digital photographs to others are for the audience to gather around a personal computer (PC) to which the photographs have been downloaded from a digital camera, or for the photographs to be printed onto paper and then passed around the intended audience. However, if the audience comprises many people, gathering around a PC can be awkward, and passing photographs around can be time consuming. To hasten the latter procedure multiple prints could be made, but this is then costly since the photographer would first be obliged to own (or at least have access to) a suitable printer and would then be required to print out a number of identical pictures, thereby consuming resources of paper and printer ink. Alternatively the photographer&apos;s digital camera itself could be passed around the audience, but this method is also time consuming, is potentially risky since the camera could get lost, stolen or damaged (particularly by someone unfamiliar with its operation) and does not readily enable the photographer to explain the photographs as they are viewed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There is accordingly a need for an alternative procedure by which digital photographs can readily be exhibited to an audience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> At home, and particularly when holding a party, people often desire an interesting yet impermanent means to decorate a room. There is particularly a desire for a means to provide an ambient dynamic display of patterns and images around a room without first having to buy and install expensive lighting equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A young infant in a cot or on a playpen requires a great deal of amusement, comforting and attention. It is common for parents to provide the infant with toys, some of which (particularly for very young babies) may be arranged to hang over the cot such that they provide an amusing distraction for the infant without the child being able to reach them. Arranging the toy to be out of reach of the child ensures that it does not present a potential health hazard (e.g. a risk of choking) to the baby. Examples of such non-contact toys are hanging mobiles and projectors, such as the Tomy (RTM) &lsquo;Lullaby Light Show&rsquo; which projects a revolving display of characters onto the ceiling or walls above the baby&apos;s cot. However, it is well known and recommended by advisers on parenting techniques that there is no substitute for the baby seeing its parents on a regular basis during the first few months of its life. A projector which displays impersonal characters to the baby, whilst providing an amusing distraction, cannot provide the comfort to the baby of seeing its parents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately a baby&apos;s parents are often unable to give their child the personal attention it ideally requires early in life. For parents who are sometimes unable to be with their child, there clearly exists a need for an alternative means by which the baby can see and be comforted by its parents when the parents are unable to attend in person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly a general object of the present invention to overcome or at least mitigate the problems identified above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention there is provided a digital image projector comprising projection means, a processor arranged to process digital images, and input means, the input means being electrically coupled to the processor and operable to supply digital images to the processor without the projector needing to be connected to a personal computer, and the processor being electrically coupled to the projection means to supply digital images to the projection means, the projector being configured to enable the image being projected to be rotated and/or translated to describe a trajectory around the surface on which the image is being projected. This has the advantage that digital photographs can readily be projected before an audience, without the user needing to own or have access to a personal computer. As a further consequence, the photographs do not need to be printed onto paper and passed around the audience, thereby saving time and the cost of printing photographs. By enabling the projected image to be moved around advantageously enables an interesting ambient display to be provided at a party or for the entertainment of a young child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably the projection means comprises a liquid crystal matrix and a light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably the input means comprises a port arranged to receive a solid state memory module on which digital image data is stored. This has the advantage of enabling a user to insert into the projector a solid state memory module on which digital photographs have been stored using another piece of equipment such as a digital camera. The projector is then able to project these images to the audience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Particularly preferably the solid state memory module is a Compact Flash card, a Memory Stick, or a Smart Media card. Advantageously these are established portable media on which digital photographs can be stored, particularly by digital cameras. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably the projection means may be adjustably angled such that, with the projection means in a first position, digital images may be projected onto a wall, and with the projection means in a second position, digital images may be projected onto a ceiling. This has the advantage of enabling photographs to be projected onto a wall for exhibition to an audience in a conventional manner, and also enables photographs or other images to be projected onto a ceiling to provide an ambient display for use at a party or to entertain or comfort a young child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably the rotation and/or translation of the image is performed electronically by the processor, thereby enabling the image to be moved without the projector needing to have moving parts to achieve this. Alternatively, the projector further comprises mechanical means operable to rotate and/or translate the projection means. These mechanical means are, for example, electrically powered motors arranged to translate the projection means or the lens, thereby causing the projected image to move around. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably the projector further comprises a turntable attached to an exterior surface of the projector, the turntable being adapted for placing on a substantially horizontal surface and configured to enable the projector to be rotated using the turntable. This advantageously provides a straightforward and effective way of providing a rotating projected image (e.g. around the walls of a room or on a ceiling), thereby giving an interesting ambient display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably the processor is configured to enable image correction algorithms to be applied to the image being projected, thereby enabling the image being projected to be compensated for any distortion arising from the projection means not facing normal to the surface on which the image is being projected, and thereby resulting in a projected image that is substantially free of distortion. This advantageously results in substantially undistorted images even though the projector might not be aligned normal to the surface on which the image is being projected. To achieve this, more preferably the projector further comprises a user interface operable to enable the input of information to the processor, the information input to the processor being interpreted by the processor to determine the appropriate image correction algorithms which are applied to the image in order to result in a projected image that is substantially free of distortion. The user interface preferably comprises buttons analogous to the adjustment controls of a computer monitor or the tracking controls of a domestic video cassette recorder, and the information supplied by the user using this user interface is interpreted by the processor to adjust the image to compensate the image to counter distortion that would otherwise result. Alternatively, the projector further comprises a wireless transmitter and receiver (particularly preferably which operate using ultrasound) operable to measure the distance from the projector to the surfaces on which the image is projected, thereby enabling the processor to determine appropriate image correction algorithms which are applied to the image in order to result in a projected image that is substantially free of distortion. This has the advantage that the projector itself determines the necessary adjustments to be made to the image in order to mitigate distortion, without any input being necessary from the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Preferably the processor is configured to enable it to be updated with information to enable it to recognise and interpret a plurality of image file formats. Such file format update information may be supplied on solid state memory modules which are inserted into the projector in the same manner as for solid state memory modules containing photographic data, or alternatively the update information may be transferred to the projector via a connection to a personal computer or the Internet. The connection means may be electrical (e.g. using a serial or USB cable) or wireless (e.g. using infra red or radio frequency (e.g. Bluetooth (RTM)) transmission). The processor is configured to update itself using this information, thereby advantageously enabling it to be able to interpret new image file formats when they are devised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Preferably the projector further comprises audio input means by which audio signals can be supplied to the processor, the processor being electrically coupled to the said audio input means and configured to alter the projected image in response to the said audio signals. Particularly preferably the audio input means comprises a microphone or audio input jacks. This facility advantageously enables the projector to respond to audio signals, in particular, to music, and to vary the projected images in time with the beats of the music. This adds functionality to the projector for use in the provision of ambient images at parties.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> digital image projector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a digital projection means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which has a lens <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through which the digital image is projected towards a surface such as a wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or a projection screen. In order for the projector to be reasonably priced, the projection means preferably comprise a liquid crystal matrix and a light source such as a lamp. Internally the projector further comprises a processor arranged to process the digital images, electrically coupled to a port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into which a solid state memory module <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be slotted and electrically coupled. Solid state memory modules are known in the field of digital photography, and digital cameras are often configured to store their photographs onto such modules which can be plugged into the camera. Examples of such solid state memory modules are Compact Flash cards, a Memory Sticks and Smart Media cards, all of which can store a plurality of digital photographs. The processor is able to cause the projection of specific photographs selected by the user, or to project a number of photographs in a cyclic or random sequence, and can manipulate the images in a variety of ways as will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is highly advantageous for the projector to be able to receive and to work with media modules which are also compatible with the user&apos;s digital camera, since this provides a straightforward method of displaying photographs: The user takes the photographs, then removes the solid state memory module from the camera, inserts it into the projector, and projects the photographs before the intended audience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The projector of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is designed to project towards a wall or a ceiling. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the projector of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can been placed on a substantially horizontal surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such that the projection means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> faces vertically upwards to enable images to be projected onto a ceiling <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A single projector can be used to project images onto both walls or ceilings, according to the user&apos;s preference. Projection onto walls would generally be undertaken when displaying photographs (e.g. of places visited on holiday) before an audience. However, the user may well wish to project images onto a ceiling instead. In this case, the images might be of an abstract nature, rather than being conventional photographs, to provide ambient room decoration at a party, for example. Alternatively images may be projected onto the ceiling above a baby&apos;s cot, in order to entertain or comfort the child. These images may advantageously be of the child&apos;s parents, to further comfort the child and to increase its familiarity with its parents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In order to better enable the provision of ambient images at parties, the projector may incorporate means to enable the processor to respond to ambient sound (music in particular) and to vary the projected image accordingly. For example, a microphone <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be incorporated in the body of the projector, or audio input jacks <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be provided to enable the projector to be connected to a music system, e.g. using a pair of phono leads. The microphone and audio input jacks are electrically connected to the processor and, on instruction by the user, the processor is configured to interpret the audio signals, to identify the beats and rhythmic characteristics of the music, and to respond to the music being played&mdash;for example, by varying the projected image in time with the music. The algorithms that would be employed by the processor to alter the projected image are known to those skilled in the art. For example, the Microsoft (RTM) Media Player 7.1 incorporates transformation algorithms which can analyse audio waveforms and provide abstract visualisations on the computer&apos;s visual display. This feature of the projector may be employed with it projecting onto a wall or a ceiling, according to the user&apos;s preference at the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Instead of the user having to move the entire projector when changing the projection direction (e.g. from horizontal to vertical), the projector may optionally incorporate adjustable projection means as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In this embodiment of the invention the projection means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be adjustably angled between a first position <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a second position <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. With the projection means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the first position <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, digital images may be projected onto a wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. However, by the user moving the projection means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into the second position <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, using the guide <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, digital images may be projected onto a ceiling <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Movement between the first and second positions may be effected manually or by the operation of a motor controlled by the processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> To provide enhanced ambient imagery at parties and other social occasions, it is desirable for the projector to move and rotate the projected image. Accordingly, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, the projector is configured to enable the image being projected to be translated to describe a trajectory around the wall or ceiling as desired, and/or to rotate the image. This translation and/or rotation may be achieved electronically, by the processor moving or rotating the image within the possible projection area of the projector. That is to say, the image that is projected is smaller than the total projection area of which the projector is capable, and the image is electronically moved and/or rotated within this area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, enabling the projection of translating or rotating images which utilise the full possible projection area of the projector, the projector may comprise mechanical means operable to translate and/or rotate the projection means itself. These mechanical means are, for example, motors arranged to move and/or rotate the projection means, in order to cause the projected image to move around. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> An alternative means to enable rotation of the projected image involves equipping the projector with a turntable, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. The turntable <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is mechanically attached to an exterior surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the body of the projector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, preferably via a motorised spindle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. When being used to provide a simple exhibition of static photographs against a wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the projector is arranged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and the turntable is not employed. However, when the user desires rotating images to be projected on a ceiling <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the projector is placed on a floor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (or another broadly horizontal surface) such that the turntable <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> lies against the floor. On activating the motorised spindle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> the turntable itself does not rotate, but the body of the projector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates with the projection means facing vertically upwards, thereby providing a rotating image on the ceiling <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The turntable <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be made to be detachable by the user from the body of the projector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the turntable feature of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> may be readily combined with the angularly-adjustable projection means of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, thereby giving a projector which may either project a rotating image onto the ceiling or may sweep an image around the walls of a room by using the rotating turntable against the floor and the projection means angled towards the walls. Moreover, if the angularly-adjustable projection means of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is motorised then, using the turntable, the projector can project a image which sweeps around the walls and also the ceiling. In such a case, the processor may be configured to vary the angle of projection whilst the projector is simultaneously rotated by the turntable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the apparatus must be designed such that, when the projector is physically rotated by the turntable, any power supply or audio cables do not become tangled around the projector as it rotates. This potential problem can be overcome by providing the electrical connection ports <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (e.g. audio input jacks <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) in the edge of the turntable <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Electrical connections pass through the inside of the rotating spindle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and through to the body of the projector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, using known techniques (e.g. electrical bushes) such that the electrical connections are maintained as the projector rotates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The projector of the present invention is intended to be readily usable without the need for a dedicated stand or careful alignment. As a consequence, it will be appreciated that the projected image could potentially suffer from distortion should the projection means not be facing normal to the surface (e.g. the wall) on which the image is being projected. This is particularly relevant during the projection of images across the walls of a room whilst the projector simultaneously rotates. To overcome this problem of image distortion, the processor is preferably configured to enable image correction algorithms and transformation functions to be applied to the image being projected, thereby compensating the image such that the projected image as viewed is substantially free of distortion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In order to determine the appropriate image correction algorithm to employ, the processor must be provided with information pertaining to the geometry of the room and the distortion to be compensated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the projector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may comprise a user interface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which typically consists of a series of buttons. These buttons, which are analogous to the adjustment controls of a computer monitor or the tracking controls of a domestic video cassette recorder, are operable by the user. By using these controls, the user supplies information to the processor vis-&agrave;-vis the degree of distortion of the image, and this information is interpreted by the processor to determine the appropriate transformation functions which are then applied to the image. The image is adjusted in real time as the user presses the buttons, to result in a viewed image that is substantially free of distortion. This user-controlled technique is particularly well suited to adjusting a stationary projected image to compensate it against distortion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The manual image compensation technique described above does not lend itself well to compensating an image that is moving around the walls of a room. This problem may be overcome using an alternative embodiment of the projector in which, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the projector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> further comprises a wireless transmitter and receiver <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> aligned with the lens of the projector. The wireless transmitter and receiver preferably operate using ultrasound, transmitting and receiving signals parallel to the direction of image projection. By measuring the time of flight of these signals and the relative intensity of each received signal in comparison to the transmitted signal the processor is able to map the room and thereby determine the appropriate correction algorithms and transformations to be applied to the image in order to result in a projected image that is substantially free of distortion. This technique has the advantage that the projector itself determines the necessary adjustments to be made to the image in order to mitigate distortion, without any input being necessary from the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> This technique of ultrasonic mapping in order to compensate the projected images requires the projector to be rotated through 360&deg; at least once prior to commencing projection. Consequently, the projector preferably incorporates a motorised turntable as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, and also means for adjusting the angle of projection as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. For performing ultrasonic mapping of walls, the optimal configuration of the projector is with the lens and ultrasound device oriented horizontally and the turntable configured to rotate the projector through 360&deg; such that the ultrasonic signal is swept around the walls of the room. As shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> number of ultrasonic pulses <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> are transmitted periodically from the projector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> during its rotation. For each transmitted pulse, the ultrasonic receiver device detects any reflected signal, measuring the intensity of the received pulse and also determining its time of flight. This intensity data is recorded with respect to the angle through which the projector has rotated, and is then interpreted by the processor. In so doing, the processor uses an algorithm based on the assumption that the projector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is in a rectangular room <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> having four planar walls <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and a ceiling perpendicular to the walls. During the 360&deg; of rotation, the processor identifies the four strongest reflected signals <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which are directly reflected perpendicularly from the four walls <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. By analysing the time of flight of these signals <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> the processor also calculates the distance of each of the corresponding four walls <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> from the projector. Signals <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> which are not reflected straight back are either lost and consequently undetected, or undergo multiple reflections and are detected but at significantly reduced intensity such that the processor effectively disregards them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The distance from the projector to the ceiling can also readily be determined by the projector by adjusting the angle of the projection means such that it faces up towards the ceiling. This reorientation of the projection means may be performed automatically as part of the mapping process described above if the angularly-adjustable projection means is motorised and the motor is controlled by the processor. Ultrasonic time of flight measurements are performed to determine the distance to the ceiling. In case the projector is not oriented normal to the ceiling, the processor may also perform a rotational ultrasonic scan through 360&deg; against the ceiling, and by interpreting the intensity of the received signals the processor can determine any misalignment of the projector with respect to the ceiling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The distance of the projector from each of the four walls and the ceiling is then used by the processor to digitally manipulate the image during subsequent projection whilst the projector rotates: The processor causes the image to be projected in a conventional manner, without compensation, when the projector is facing normal to one of the walls or the ceiling. However, when the projector has rotated such that it is no longer facing normal to a projection surface, the processor uses the geometry of the room with respect to the projector and the angle through which the projector has rotated in order to determine the necessary adjustment to be made digitally to the image in order to compensate it against distortion. That is to say, the image as generated by the projection means is adjusted such that the image that is actually viewed on the projection surface is substantially (as far as possible) undistorted. This image adjustment is performed digitally using appropriate geometric transformations known to those skilled in the art. The transformations would typically be image warping such as perspective projection corrections (e.g. non-linear stretching or compression of the image along one or two axes). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The use of ultrasonic pulses also enables the projector to automatically focus on the projection surface. By determining the distance from the projector to the projection surface, and by employing techniques known to those skilled in projector construction, the processor can be configured to adjust the lens of the projector to provide an image of optimal focus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As users of computer equipment are aware, a variety of image file formats exist, and new ones are introduced from time to time. Highly advantageously, the processor is configured be able to be updated with information to enable it to recognise and interpret new image file formats when they are devised. Such file format update information may be supplied on solid state memory modules which are inserted into the projector in the same manner as for solid state memory modules containing photographic data, or alternatively the update information may be transferred to the projector via a connection to a personal computer or the Internet. The connection means may be electrical (e.g. using a serial or USB cable) or wireless (e.g. using infra red or radio frequency (e.g. Bluetooth (RTM)) transmission). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Additional Optional Features of the Projector </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A projector constructed in accordance with the present invention may optionally be configured to handle moving images, and optionally sound via the incorporation of a built-in speaker or audio output jacks to enable the projector to be connected to a sound system. These moving images could be short video clips taken by a digital camera, or a longer video film recorded using a video camera or supplied as a pre-recorded commercially-produced movie. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Electronic Architecture of the Projector </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the electronic architecture of a projector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the present invention comprises a processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> electrically connected to projection means <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which preferably comprise a liquid crystal matrix and a light source. The processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is also connected to a solid state memory port <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> arranged to accept and electrically couple with a solid state memory module such as flash card, and to a power supply <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> such as a battery or an ac mains transformer. The power supply <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> provides electrical power, either directly or via the processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, to the electronic and electrical components within the projector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is connected to built-in memory <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which enables the &lsquo;hot-swapping&rsquo; of flash cards. Hot-swapping is a process by which flash cards can be inserted and removed whilst the projector remains electrically operational, and enables a picture to remain displayed when the flash card is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Also connected to the processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are a user interface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprising buttons (or alternatively a touch panel) to enable the user to input instructions to the processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and an ultrasound transmitter and receiver <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to enable the projector to map the position of the walls or ceiling. The user interface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> enables the user to adjust the projected image to compensate for distortion, as described previously, and also provides appropriate buttons and controls for the general control of the projector, including an on/off switch and controls to enable the user to activate or deactivate the turntable (and to set its speed of rotation). Controls are also provided to cause the processor to display a single image, or an array of &lsquo;thumbnail&rsquo; images from which the user can select a desired image for projection, or a number of images in a predetermined sequence (either proceeding automatically through the sequence or waiting to receive input from the user before advancing). Additionally the user interface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes means to cause the processor to generate (and display using the projection means) a menu of further options relating to the configuration of the projector. These further options include setting the desired rotation and translation effects to be applied to the images, and also determining how the projection should respond to ambient sound or music. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Further connected to the processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are an electrical cable connection <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to enable the projector to be connected to a personal computer, an infra-red transmitter and receiver <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and a radio frequency (Bluetooth (RTM)) transmitter and receiver <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that none of these connectivity features are essential for the projector to be able to operate in accordance with the present invention, but they are desirable in order to allow the device to communicate with other electronic devices such as PCs or portable data assistants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> To enable the projector to be connected to a music system in order to provide dynamic ambient images that respond in time with music, the processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is connected to a pair of audio input jacks <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a microphone <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> To enable the projector to play images (e.g. movies) which are accompanied by prerecorded sound, the processor is also connected to audio output jacks <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and a built-in speaker <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the power supply <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are also connected to an electric motor <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> to operate a turntable, and additional electric motors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to translate, rotate and adjust the angle of the projection means, all of which enable the projector to provide an interesting display of moving and rotating ambient imagery. </paragraph>
