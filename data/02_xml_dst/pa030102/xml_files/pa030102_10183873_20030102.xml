<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to apparatus and method for creating a map of a real name word to an anonymous word for an electric document useful when requesting others to analyze an anonymous version of the document and receiving an analysis result of the document from the others. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> By developing information communication, such as the Internet, it becomes easy for a plurality of persons each belonging to different organizations to do business in cooperation with each other. For example, assume that a company A possesses customer data and a company B possesses know-how of data analysis. In this case, company A often requests company B to analyze the customer data by supplying the customer data in a database through the Internet. Company A receives an analysis report of the customer data from company B, and sends an indication of the analysis again to company B using E-mail. Briefly, by giving and taking of various kinds of electronic documents through the Internet, business can be easily executed among a plurality of companies (organizations). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In transfer (giving and taking) of electronic documents among different companies, management of important information such as customer data or company secret data in the electronic document is a question. In the above example of the database supplied from the company A to the company B, secret data not to become known by the company B is often included. In the prior art, secret data is deleted by a user himself or by a computer program, or ciphered as meaningless data for person. However, if deleted (or ciphered) data includes information necessary for analysis, the information cannot be utilized for analysis. Furthermore, if the secret data is ciphered as a character-string that prevents a person from understanding, a hindrance often occurs in the business between the company A and the company B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In data communication through the Internet, a prior method for hiding secret data for a sender, Japanese Patent Disclosure (Kokai) PH2000-324094 is known. In this method, personal information such as a name is hidden in the sending information. However, other kinds of secret data (all contents) in the electronic document cannot be hidden. Furthermore, the hidden part (anonymous part) in the electronic document cannot be returned to a real name. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As mentioned-above, when the electronic document including important information of the user&apos;s own company is transferred and analyzed by another company, the other company is in need of information about the important information. However, in the prior method in which secret data is deleted or ciphered, it is a problem that a document processing person (analyst) in another company cannot understand the electronic document sufficiently for analysis. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the present invention will be explained by referring to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In general, the word &ldquo;anonymize&rdquo; means to convert to a more general form. Likewise, the term &ldquo;unanonymize&rdquo; means to convert back from a less specific and more general form to a more specific and less general form. The conversion of a document to and from a less specific or anonymous version of the document allows third party manipulation and analysis of the document while keeping the document&apos;s details secret. Embodiments of the present invention achieve this with real name words, anonymous terms, and anonymous words. In embodiments of the present invention, a predetermined noun and a term representing a predetermined unit are respectively defined as a real name word. As examples of the real name word, a proper noun such as Tokyo Tower and a unit such as Mbyte (Mega byte) are selected. Next, the real name word is vaguely represented by an abstract concept. In the case of a unit as the real name word, a numerical value accompanied with a predetermined unit is converted as vague numerical value having no difficulty in analyzing for analyst (For example, proportion relationship among a plurality of numerical values is preserved). In this case, information used for conversion (anonymization) of the real name word is called an anonymous term. For example, the anonymous term corresponding to Tokyo Tower is a landmark building or a building. A plurality of anonymous terms corresponding to the same real name word can be prepared according to abstract degrees. Furthermore, the anonymous term corresponding to Mbyte can be a random magnification such as 1/1000 times or 12 times to mask the specific amount of the real term. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Next, an anonymous word is defined as follows. If the real name word is a predetermined noun, an additional label uniquely representing each predetermined noun is added to the anonymous term corresponding to the predetermined noun. For example, an additional label may be &ldquo;A, B, C, . . .&rdquo; or &ldquo;1, 2, 3 . . .&rdquo;. Briefly, the anonymous term with the additional label is called the anonymous word. If the real name word is associated with a predetermined unit, the anonymous term (magnification) corresponding to the predetermined unit is multiplied with a numerical value accompanied with the predetermined unit, and an addition label uniquely representing each predetermined unit is added to the multiplication result as the anonymous word. For example, a landmark building A, a building B, or <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> unit, are generated as the anonymous term. If a plurality of units (For example, number of units, weight, length, and so on) are included in the electronic document, a unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is assigned to the number of units and a unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is assigned to the weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, a consistent relationship between the real name word in the electronic document and the anonymous word is preserved as a map (such as a correspondence table) corresponding to a document processing person such as each analyst. By changing the map in correspondence with each document processing person, the electronic document is converted (anonymized) into an understandable representation of the document for a person. In this case, a person who has a right to know the real name word is called a user, and a person who does not have a right to know the real name word is called a document processing person. A company or an organization which has a right to know the real name word is also a user for the purposes of this invention. A company or an organization which does not have a right to know the real name word is also a document processing person for the purposes of this invention. Furthermore, a document including the real name word is called a real name document, and a document not including the real name word is called an anonymous document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the apparatus for creating a map of real name word/anonymous word in an electronic document according to the first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this apparatus is typically implemented in a computer (not shown) and includes an anonymous level decision unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a document processing person ID (identification number) memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an anonymous level data memory <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a random number generator <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a real name word/anonymous word map generator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a real name word/anonymous term dictionary memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and a real name word/anonymous word map memory <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the anonymous level decision unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the anonymous level representing an abstract degree to convert is determined for each real name word in the electronic document. Anonymous level data consisting of these anonymous levels are stored in the anonymous level data memory <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. As a method for determining the anonymous level, for example, the anonymous level predetermined for each real name word may be selected, a user corrects the predetermined anonymous level using a GUI (Graphical User Interface) by referring to the real name word/anonymous term dictionary memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, or the anonymous level of the real name word is set by analyzing the document for usage of the real name word. Typically, the anonymous level is set low if the usage frequency is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example of the anonymous level data in case that the user suitably sets the anonymous level by referring to the real name word/anonymous term dictionary memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the anonymous level is determined for each real name word. In general, the abstract degree of the real name word becomes high in proportion to degree which the user does not wish that the analyst (the document processing person) would know the real name word. Accordingly, in this case, the anonymous level of the real name word is high. For example, if the user does not absolutely wish that the analyst would know what the commodity name &ldquo;Tynabook&rdquo; is, the anonymous level is set as the highest level <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As mentioned-above, if the anonymous level is determined for each real name word by the user&apos;s direct indication, the map <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of real name word/anonymous word (explained hereinafter) on which the user&apos;s intention is affected is created. Furthermore, by referring to the sample electronic document, the anonymous level of the real name word can be determined so that the abstract degree of the real name word frequently used in the sample document becomes relatively low. This may be done because a frequently used real name word can be important for a subject of the document. In this case, the suitable map <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (explained hereinafter) can be automatically created without the user&apos;s burden. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the document processing person ID memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a document processing person ID is stored and used to discriminate each person (analyst) who processes the anonymous document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the real name word/anonymous term dictionary memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the anonymous term representing the abstract concept corresponding to each anonymous level is stored in correspondence with each real name word. In the real name word/anonymous term dictionary memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the narrower the category of the real name word, the larger the number of the abstract concepts (anonymous terms) because the real name word of a narrow category is typically important information. On the other hand, if category of the real name word (such as a common noun) is wide, the number of the abstract concept (anonymous term) may be few. Because the real name word of wide category is originally abstract, the importance of the information is typically not so high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In general, a &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; can be any type of lookup or accessible memory used to store information. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an example of contents of the real name word/anonymous term dictionary in an embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the narrower the category of the real name word, the larger the number of the anonymous level. For example, in case of a common noun of wide category such as &ldquo;notebook personal computer&rdquo;, one anonymous level is only prepared. On the other hand, in case of a commodity name of narrow category such as &ldquo;Tynabook&rdquo;, four anonymous levels are prepared. Furthermore, in case that the real name word represents a unit (Such as, weight, number of units, and so on), a normalization numerical value, such as magnification, is prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the real name word/anonymous word map generator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the document processing person ID of the analyst is read from the document processing person ID memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the anonymous level data of each real name word is read from the anonymous level data memory <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Then, by using a random number generated from the random number generator <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an additional label preserving uniqueness between the real name word and the anonymous term is generated. Then, the anonymous word is created by adding the additional label to the anonymous term stored in the real name word/anonymous term dictionary memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In this way, the real name word/anonymous word map representing a relationship (e.g., one-to-one) between each real name word and corresponding anonymous word is created and stored in the real name word/anonymous word map dictionary <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> If a plurality of document processing persons exists or if the number of additional labels is large, generation of the additional label using the random number may be more effective in comparison with determination by the user&apos;s operation. However, if the number of additional labels is few, the additional label may be determined by the user&apos;s operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an example of the real name word/anonymous word map in case of using the anonymous level data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and the real name word/anonymous term dictionary shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. By referring to correspondence relationship stored in the real name word/anonymous word map <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, anonimization and unanonimization of the electronic document is executed. In this case, the anonymous term of each real name word &ldquo;Tynabook&rdquo;, &ldquo;Waio&rdquo; and &ldquo;Think Qad&rdquo; are respectively &ldquo;BRAND&rdquo;. If the anonymous term is used as the anonymous word as itself, a one-to-one relationship between the real name word and the anonymous word cannot be preserved. Accordingly, a plurality of random numbers of which the number of random numbers is equal to the number of the same anonymous terms is generated, and the additional label corresponding to each random number is added to each anonymous term. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the additional label corresponding to each random number &ldquo;1, 2, 3&rdquo; is respectively &ldquo;A, B, C&rdquo;. As a result, for example, the anonymous word corresponding to the real name word &ldquo;Tynabook&rdquo; is &ldquo;BRAND A&rdquo;. Briefly, a one-to-one relationship between each real name word and corresponding anonymous word can be preserved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if the real name word represents a unit with a numerical value, the normalization value (magnification) generated by the random number is stored as the anonymous term. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the anonymous term corresponding to a real name word &ldquo;(Y) number of units&rdquo; is &ldquo;11/100&rdquo;. In this case, the additional label is predetermined as a generic term such as &ldquo;UNIT&rdquo;. This magnification is multiplied with the numerical value &ldquo;(Y)&rdquo; included in the real name word, and the additional label is added to the multiplication result as the anonymous word. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in case of the real name word &ldquo;(Y) number of units&rdquo;, the anonymous word is &ldquo;(Y/100) unit&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As mentioned-above, the random number is used in case of creating the real name word/anonymous word map. As a result, when a user respectively requests two document processing persons A and B to analyze the same real name document, the user can respectively provide the document differently anonymized to the two document processing persons, A and B. Accordingly, if the document is unwillingly issued, the user can estimate the document processing person who has provided the document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flow chart of a method for creating the map of real name word/anonymous word of an electronic document according to the first embodiment of the present invention. First, in the anonymous level decision unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the anonymous level of each real name word in the electronic document is determined and stored in the anonymous level data memory <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). Next, in the real name word/anonymous word map generation unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the document processing person ID of the analyst is read from the document processing person ID memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. By using a random number generated from the random number generator <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the additional label of each real name word is created in correspondence with the document processing person ID (S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). Furthermore, as for each real name word of which the anonymous level is already determined in the anonymous level data memory <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the anonymous term corresponding to the anonymous level is retrieved from the real name word/anonymous term dictionary memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Then, by adding the additional label to the anonymous term, the anonymous word is generated (S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). Last, the real name word/anonymous word map representing one-to-one relationship between each real name word and corresponding anonymous word is stored in the real name word/anonymous word map memory <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the apparatus for anonymizing an electronic document according to the second embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flow chart of processing of a method for anonymizing an electronic document in an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, this apparatus is implemented in a computer and includes a real name document memory <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a real name word extraction unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a real name word extraction document memory <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the document processing person ID memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a real name word-anonymous conversion unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, the real name word/anonymous word map memory <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and an anonymous document memory <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the real name document memory <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a real name document as the electronic document of which contents are to be abstracted is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the real name word extraction unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the real name document is read from the real name document memory <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the real name word/anonymous word map is read from the real name word/anonymous word map memory <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Then, each real name word registered in the real name word/anonymous word map is extracted from the real name document. A real name word extraction document from which each real name word is extracted (discriminated) is stored in the real name word extraction document memory <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an example of the electronic document from which the real name word is extracted. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the real name word is extracted from the real name document of table format data, and the extracted real name word is discriminated by &ldquo;&lsqb;&rsqb;&rdquo; in the real name document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the document processing person ID memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, identification number of a person (analyst) to process a document anonimized from the real name document is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the real name word-anonymous conversion unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, a real name word extraction document is read from the real name word extraction document memory <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and a document processing person ID of the analyst is read from the document processing person ID memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Then, a real name word/anonymous word map corresponding to the document processing person ID is selected from the real name word/anonymous word map memory <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The anonymous word corresponding to each real name word in the real name word extraction document is decided by referring to the real name word/anonymous word map (S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). Furthermore, each real name word discriminated in the real name word extraction document is converted to a decided anonymous word. In this way, an anonymous document in which each real name word is replaced by the anonymous word is created and stored in the anonymous document memory <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the case of converting an ordinary real name word to the anonymous word, the anonymous word is created by adding the additional label to the anonymous term corresponding to the ordinary real name word. In the case of converting a real name word, such as a numerical value with a predetermined unit (For example, weight, length, . . .), to the anonymous word, a magnification as the anonymous term corresponding to the real name word is multiplied to the numerical value, and the additional label corresponding to the real name word is added to the multiplication result as the anonymous word. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an example of document of which real name word is converted to the anonymous word in an embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, each real name word in the real name word extraction document of table format data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is converted to the anonymous word. The anonymous document shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> represents sales data (the number of units) of product category A in April for each branch. Assume that the similar data in January, February, March, exist (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), and that a user requests a document processing person (analyst) to analyze these sales data from January to April as the anonymous document. The user receives a analysis result (a newly created anonymous document related with the anonymous document) from the document processing person. Hereinafter, a method for unanonymizing the analysis result is explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is block diagram of the apparatus for unanonymizing an electronic document according to the third embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flow chart of processing of a method for unanonymizing the electronic document according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, this apparatus is typically implemented in a computer and includes an anonymous document memory <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, an anonymous word extraction unit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, an anonymous word extraction document memory <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the document processing person ID memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an anonymous word-real name conversion unit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the real name word/anonymous word map memory <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and a real name document memory <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. In case of converting the analysis document (anonymous document sent from the document processing person) to a real name document, the user first stores the anonymous document in the anonymous document memory <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> by using an electronic file. Furthermore, the user stores a document processing person ID of the document processing person in the document processing person ID memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by using a keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the anonymous document memory <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the anonymous document of which contents are to be unanonymized is stored. In the document processing person ID memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the document processing person ID of the document processing person who created the anonymous document (analysis result) is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the anonymous word extraction unit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, an anonymous document to be unanonymized is read from the anonymous document memory <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, and a real name word/anonymous word map corresponding to the document processing person ID is read from the real name word/anonymous word map memory <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Then, each anonymous word registered in the real name word/anonymous word map is extracted from the anonymous document. The anonymous document is created as an anonymous word extraction document and stored in the anonymous word extraction document memory <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows an example of conversion from the anonymous document to the anonymous word extraction document. As shown in the anonymous word extraction document, each anonymous word included in the anonymous document created by the document processing person is extracted. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, each anonymous word is surrounded by &ldquo;&verbar; &verbar;&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the anonymous word-real name conversion unit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the anonymous word extraction document is read from the anonymous word extraction document memory <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, and the document processing person ID of the document processing person who created the anonymous document is read from the document processing person ID memory <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Then, the real name word/anonymous word map corresponding to the document processing person ID is selected from the real name word/anonymous word map memory <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The real name word corresponding to each anonymous word included in the anonymous word extraction document is decided by referring to the real name word/anonymous word map (S<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). Furthermore, each real name word in the anonymous word extraction document is replaced by a corresponding anonymous word or the corresponding anonymous word is added to each real name word in the anonymous word extraction document. In this way, a real name document is created and stored in the real name document memory <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the case of converting an ordinary anonymous word to a real name word, the real name word is created by selecting the real name word corresponding to the ordinary anonymous word. In the case of converting an anonymous word such as a numerical value with a predetermined term (additional label) such as &ldquo;UNIT&rdquo; to a real name word, the numerical value is divided by a normalization value (magnification) as the anonymous term corresponding to the anonymous word registered in the real name word/anonymous word map. The predetermined term is then replaced by a predetermined unit (for example, weight, length, and so on) of the real name word corresponding to the anonymous word registered in the real name word/anonymous word map. The predetermined unit is combined with the division result. In this way, the real name word is created (restored). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows an example of conversion from the anonymous word extraction document to the real name document in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, one real name document (left side document) includes each real name word converted from the anonymous word in the anonymous word extraction document, and the other real name document (right side document) includes both each real name and corresponding anonymous word. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As mentioned-above, in embodiments of the present invention, the real name word (predetermined noun/actual numerical) which the user does not wish to become known by the document processing person in the electronic document is anonymized as a daily use representation. Accordingly, the anonymized or anonymous document can be provided to the document processing person without preventing the document processing person from understanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the relationship between each real name word and corresponding anonymous word is preserved as the real name word/anonymous word map on the user side. In the real name word/anonymous word map, the additional label to maintain one-to-one relationship between the real name word and the anonymous word is typically included. Accordingly, when the user receives the analysis report (new anonymous document) related to the anonymous document from the document processing person, the user can read the real name document converted from the analysis report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the case of converting the analysis report to the real name document, by adding the real name word to the anonymous word in the analysis report, the user can more easily understand contents of the analysis report by the real name word. In addition to this, when the user talks to the document processing person about the analysis report by telephone or in person, the user can smoothly communicate with the document processing person not by using important information but by using the anonymous word. Briefly, business such as the reordering of analysis can be executed for the user while leakage of important information is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The processing of the above-mentioned various embodiments can be accomplished by a computer-executable program, and this program can be realized in a computer-readable memory device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, the memory device, such as a magnetic disk, floppy disk, hard disk optical disk (CD-ROM, CD-R, DVD, and so on), optical magnetic disk (MD, and so on) can be used to store instructions for causing a processor or computer to perform the processes described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, based on an indication of the program installed from the memory device to the computer, an OS(operation system) operating on the computer, or MW(middle wear), such as database management software or network, may execute one part of each processing to realize the embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the memory device is not limited to a device independent from the computer. By downloading a program transmitted through a network, such as a LAN or the Internet, a memory device in which the program is stored is included. Furthermore, the memory device is not limited to one. In the case that the processing of the embodiments is executed by a plurality of memory devices, the plurality of memory devices may be included in the memory device. The components of the device may be arbitrarily composed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the described embodiments of the present invention, the computer executes each processing of the embodiments according to the program stored in the memory device. The computer may be one apparatus, such as a personal computer or a system in which a plurality of apparatuses are connected through the network. Furthermore, in embodiments of the present invention, the computer is not limited to the personal computer. The computer may be a processing unit in an information processor, a micro computer, and so on. In short, the computer is generally any processing structure and memory that can execute the functions described above in embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
