<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an administration process and system for manufacturing and selling products, and relates specifically to a processing method and a processing device for processing manufacturing data and sales data of products, a product pricing process and pricing device and a POS system, a product pricing and registration system, and a product discounting process and discounting system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A first problem in the related art is described below. Because perishable foods such as dressed meat undergo processing at a store, the form of the product purchased by the store differs from the form of the product sold by the store. For example, the store purchases meat in block units from a meat wholesaler, and manufactures a variety of differently priced products such as &ldquo;beef(for sukiyaki)&rdquo;, &ldquo;beef (for shabushabu)&rdquo;, or &ldquo;beef(for steak)&rdquo; from this purchased meat block (for example a beef block), and these products are then priced and displayed on a rack for sale to customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because the shelf life of such perishable foods is short, products which are past their expiry date must be marked for disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, because with perishable foods a plurality of differently priced products are manufactured from a product purchased in block units, and because discounting and disposal of products is performed frequently according to the time that has passed since the product was manufactured, conventionally, problems occurred in that inventory control and the management of gross margins for each purchased block unit were troublesome, and accurate data could not be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, conventionally, it was impossible to obtain inventory data and sales data for products manufactured from a specific block, and managing these figures was by rough estimate only. Consequently, a problem occurred in that the setting of prices, and the establishment of manufacturing plans and sales plans could not be performed on the basis of accurate data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, conventionally, products were checked periodically by employees and marked for disposal when past their expiry date, but this operation is troublesome, and furthermore, an employee may miss a product which is past its expiry date, which may then be inadvertently sold, thereby potentially reducing the trust the customer has in the store. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a second problem is described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned system, at the checkout where the customer pays for the product he/she purchases, an ID number on the product is read, stored manufacturing data is retrieved using this ID number, and product registration processing is then performed. In order to realize this type of system, the design of the system must be such that the product registration process (checkout process) can be performed unimpeded even when the manufacturing data cannot be retrieved during registration due to such problems as an inability to communicate with the administration device (server) where the manufacturing data is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in order to ensure that the aforementioned system can be adopted smoothly by users of an older system, it is desirable that the system is designed so that the operations currently performed by users (such as the clearance product discounting process, wherein perishable food products which are losing freshness are sold at a discount) are not changed drastically, and that current equipment (such as barcode scanners and the like) does not need to be replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In addition, a third problem is described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Recently, due to the emergence of &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo; as a social problem, customers increasingly want to know the manufacturing channels of the perishable foods such as meat and fish which they purchase, so that they can be sure of the safety of the products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a store needs to secure repeat customers by informing this type of customer of the fact that the manufacturing channels of its products are known and are safe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, a system which meets these needs of both the customer and the store has not yet been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a fourth problem is described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Because the commercial value of perishable foods and daily dishes and the like decreases according to their freshness, the amount of product which remains unsold is decreased by discounting products for which a predetermined length of time has passed since manufacturing or processing (clearance products). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a conventional method for discounting clearance products, an employee (1) takes a portable label printer onto the selling floor, (2) keys in the amount of the discount or the discounted price of the product, and scans the barcode of the price label of the product to be discounted and issues a barcode label with the discounted price, (3) applies the newly issued barcode label over the top of the original price label, and (4) affixes a POP label to the product which informs the customer of the discounted price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> However, in this conventional discounting method, because an employee must take a label printer onto the selling floor, and issue barcode labels with the discounted price on the selling floor, and because the issued barcode label must then be applied over the top of the original price label of the product, the work required is very troublesome and time consuming. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the aforementioned invention, because a second ID number (the block ID number) for identifying the raw material block is stored for each perishable food product (for each pack ID) as part of the manufacturing (log) data, it is possible to total manufacturing data for each raw material block unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because a second ID number is stored for each pack ID number, if defective goods are detected after sale, or if a complaint is received from a customer, a determination can be made as to which raw material block was used in the product manufacture, and it is therefore possible to investigate the purchase date, the manufacturer from whom the product was purchased, and the person in charge of the purchase and the like, and thereby trace the source of the defect, which leads to accountability in manufacturing control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In addition, because the data required for product registration such as the product code and price is included in the manufacturing data for each product, it is possible to perform product registration using this data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention also provides a product sales data processing method wherein when pricing a product, a first ID number (a pack ID number) for individually identifying each product is printed on the price label as a machine readable code such as a barcode, and manufacturing data including a second ID number (block ID number) linked to this first ID number (pack ID number) for identifying the raw material block from which the product was manufactured is stored, and at the checkout, sales data is totaled against this first ID number (the pack ID number) In this case, it is preferable that the stored manufacturing data linked with the first ID number (pack ID number) includes the data required for product registration such as the product code and price, and at the checkout, this first ID number (pack ID number) is read from the price label of the product, and the data required in order to register the product identified by the first ID number (pack ID number) is read from the stored manufacturing data, and product registration is then performed based on this read data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to the aforementioned invention, because sales data is stored linked with the first ID number (the pack ID number), and because the second ID number (the block ID number) is stored linked with the first ID number (the pack ID number), sales data can be totaled for each raw material block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when totaling the sales data, it is preferable that products which have been discounted can be differentiated from those products which have not, and that for a product which has been discounted, either the amount by which the product has been discounted, or the selling price of the product after the discount, can be determined when totaling data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to the aforementioned invention, it is possible to gather price discount data for each raw material block unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when a product is marked for disposal, it is preferable that the disposal data is totaled linked with the first ID number (the pack ID number) of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> According to the aforementioned invention, it is possible for the disposal data to be totaled for each raw material block unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is preferable that the aforementioned sales data is extracted for each second ID number (block ID number), and that total sales data is calculated and totaled for each second ID number (block ID number). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the aforementioned PLU file which is used in the pricing process, the manufacturing performance file (the totaled file and the manufacturing log file) which is described below, and a raw material block file which is described below are all stored in a storage device (for example RAM) of the file server FS, although this storage device is not shown in the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Here, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the data configuration of the PLU file used in the pricing process. As shown in the figure, pricing data such as the product name, unit price, tare weight and expiry date for each product number is stored in the PLU file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Here, the unit price is the price of one product for fixed price products, and for weighed products is the price of 100 grams net. Furthermore, the tare weight is the weight of the packaging, such as the tray, in weighed products. This PLU file can be referred to or downloaded by the weighing packaging pricing machine AW, the weight label printer DPS, the label printer DP, the store controller SC, the POS registers PR and the handy terminal HT, as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the details of the aforementioned manufacturing performance file are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The operation of the product manufacturing data and sales data processing system according to the first embodiment of the present invention is described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The processes implemented by this system are separated into</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> (1) a product manufacturing and pricing process, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> (2) a product registration/payment sales data totaling process, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> (3) a manufacturing and sales data preparation and output process.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The respective processes are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> (1) Product Manufacturing and Pricing Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> This process comprises a pricing process wherein a product (for example &ldquo;beef for sukiyaki&rdquo; or &ldquo;beef for steak&rdquo;) is manufactured and processed from a raw material block (for example a beef block) and a price label (barcode label) is issued for the manufactured and processed product and then affixed to the product, and a totaling process which totals the manufacturing and processing data (label issue data). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the aforementioned price labels are issued for weighed products for which the weight is different for each product using either the weighing/packaging/pricing machine AW or the weight label printer DPS, and are issued for fixed price products using the price label printer DP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing an outline of the steps of the pricing process and totaling process. A case where the pricing process is performed using the weight label printer DPS is described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the person in charge of pricing inputs and sets the raw material block number (hereafter referred to as the block ID) which is a number which identifies and specifies the raw material block of the product to be priced (step S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned block ID number (raw material block number) is an identification number assigned by the store for identifying a raw material block. In other words, when a raw material block arrives at the store, information such as the (1) date and time of arrival, (2) raw material block product name, (3) raw material block code, (4) price of purchase, (5) weight of purchase, (6) unit price of purchase, (7) supplier code, and (8) the code of person in charge are input for each block ID number using the weight label printer DPS. The (1) date and time of arrival is set automatically based on the clock data supplied by the clock <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the weight label printer DPS, and furthermore, (5) the weight of purchase is set automatically to the weight supplied by the weighing section, and (6) the unit price of purchase is calculated from the price of the purchase and the weight of the purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Moreover, after the aforementioned data is input, a block ID label, on which the block ID number, the block product name and the date and time of arrival and the like are printed, is printed and issued. The issued block ID label is attached to the raw material block and is used by the operator to identify the raw material block when a product is manufactured from the raw material block. Moreover, the data which is input for each block ID number is sent to the aforementioned file server FS and stored in the raw material block file in the file server FS (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> At this time, an area (inventory field) where inventory data is stored is appended to each block ID number, and by subtracting the processed weight from the weight purchased, the inventory information is updated in real time for each block ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the person in charge of processing the products manufactures a product from a raw material block, by attaching an either hand written or printed raw materials slip to the butt or cart which is used to transport the product, the person in charge of pricing is notified of the aforementioned block ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The person in charge of pricing checks the block ID number on the raw materials slip which is attached to the butt or the like of the product to be priced, and inputs this ID number using the operation panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Next, the person in charge of pricing inputs the product number of the product (step S<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>). The CPU <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inside the weight label printer DSP then retrieves the product data such as product name, unit price and tare weight relating to this product number from the PLU file stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>). Moreover, in the present embodiment, the PLU file stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used, but the PLU file stored in the file server FS may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Next, when the person in charge of pricing places the manufactured and processed product on the scale, the weight label printer DSP weighs the product (step S<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>), and calculates the price of the product by multiplying the net weight, which is the tare weight subtracted from the measured weight, by the unit price (step S<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>). A price label is then issued on which is printed a barcode (pack ID barcode) which can individually identify the product and includes data on the date of processing, time of processing, and number sequence of the product, and on which is also printed other information (for example the product name, price, weight, expiry date, unit price and the like) (step S<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>). Moreover, the expiry date is determined by adding the shelf life of the product to the date and time of processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> price label is issued in which a barcode which can individually identify each product and comprises information on the date of processing, time of processing, and number sequence of the product is displayed in the bottom left corner, and in other positions on the label are displayed predetermined pieces of information such as the product name, processing date, expiry date, unit price, weight and price. This price label can be affixed to the weighed product either automatically or by hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, after the pricing process is completed by performing the aforementioned series of steps, information is written to the manufacturing performance file in the file server FS, based on the data provided on the issued price label (step S<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). The manufacturing performance file is described below in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Next, a determination is made as to whether or not there are products with the same product number that are still to be priced (step S<highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>). If there are still products to be priced, the process from step S<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> onward is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if it is determined that all the products with the same product number have been priced, then the pricing process for this particular product is finished, and the process is repeated from step S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> onward for another product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Next, the composition of the aforementioned barcode is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. As shown in this figure, the pack ID barcode according to the present embodiment includes information on the date of processing, time of processing and the number sequence, and functions as an ID number which can individually identify each product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> This ID barcode comprises a flag &ldquo;FF&rdquo; comprising the first 2 digits of the barcode which indicates that the barcode is an in-store code and a pack ID barcode, a two digit manufacturing date code &ldquo;DD&rdquo; which specifies the processing date, a four digit hour/minute code &ldquo;HHHH&rdquo; which specifies the time of manufacture (processing), a four digit number sequence &ldquo;NNNN&rdquo; and a one digit check digit &ldquo;C/D&rdquo; for checking whether or not each digit of the barcode is read correctly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is necessary to design the number sequence so that when the pricing operation is performed using a plurality of pricing devices simultaneously, the same ID number is not assigned more than once. For example, if the first digit of the number sequence is set to a number identifying the pricing device (machine number), then the same ID number can never be applied more than once. Furthermore, the assignment of the number sequence may also be administered by the file server FS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> By employing such a composition, because one ID number (pack ID number) is assigned for one product as a barcode, it is possible to individually identify each weighed product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Next, the manufacturing performance file (totaling process) totaled in the totaling process is described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> show the data configuration of the manufacturing performance file. The manufacturing performance file comprises a first file (totaled file) in which the total number of items, total weight and total price are respectively stored for each product number shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, and a second file (manufacturing log file) in which individual manufacturing data such as the product number, price, weight, cost, date of processing, expiry date, block ID number and flag are respectively linked to each pack ID number shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the number input in step S<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the aforementioned pricing process is stored as the product number, and the block ID number set in step S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the same pricing process is stored as the block ID number. The flag indicates the sale status of the manufactured product, and is stored as &ldquo;0&rdquo; during pricing. Moreover, if the product is sold at the standard price the flag is changed to &ldquo;1&rdquo; if the product is sold at a discounted price the flag is changed to &ldquo;2&rdquo; and if the product is marked for disposal, the flag is changed to &ldquo;3&rdquo; By checking this flag, the status of the product following processing can be determined. Moreover, this process is described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing performance file (the totaled file and the manufacturing log file) is then sent to the store controller SC of the POS system via the LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> (2) Product Registration/Payment/Sales Data Totaling Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The product registration/payment/sales data totaling process is described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> This process is performed at a POS register PR for the products the customer has brought from the product shelves and wishes to purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing the steps involved in the product registration/payment sales data totaling process. In this figure, the product is first registered based on the data read from the barcode by the scanner <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the POS register PR (step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, described in detail below), and this registration process is repeated until all products have been registered (step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Next, the total cost of the registered products is displayed (step S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>), and the payment process for these products is performed (step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Next, the product registration process of step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> for weight priced products according to the present invention is described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Firstly, the barcode attached to the product, in other words the pack ID number (identification information) of the product, is read by the scanner <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the POS register PR (step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>). Once the pack ID number of the product is obtained, the manufacturing data including the product number and price and the like (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>) corresponding with this ID number is retrieved from the manufacturing log file in the manufacturing performance file stored in the store controller SC, via the communication section (step S<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a determination is made as to whether or not the product has expired, by referring to the expiry data read from the manufacturing log file (step S<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>). Moreover, this determination is made by referring to the date and time of the clock of the PR register. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> If the product is determined to be past its expiry date, (&ldquo;YES&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>), a warning is displayed to inform the operator of the POS register PR of this fact (step S<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>). Moreover, a warning sound may also sound at the same time as the warning is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the product is determined to not be past its expiry date, (&ldquo;NO&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>), a determination is made as to whether or not an amount of time exceeding a predetermined amount of time (predetermined period) has passed since the product was processed, based on the data on the date and time of processing included in the pack ID number read in step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and the time of the clock <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the POS register PR. If a predetermined length of time has passed, then a discounting process is performed (step S<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>). In other words, the discounted price is calculated based on the discount file stored in the store controller SC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Product registration is then performed based on the product number and price read from the manufacturing log file, or the discounted price, and the registration data is sent to the store controller SC. The sales performance file of the store controller SC is then updated, and the flag for the product is changed in the manufacturing log file (step S<highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>). Moreover, the registration data sent to the store controller SC is the product number and the price in the case of a non-discounted product, and the product number, the price and the discounted price in the case of a discounted product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Moreover, this flag is changed to &ldquo;1&rdquo; for a product which was sold at the normal price without a discount, and changed to &ldquo;2&rdquo; for a product which was sold at a discount. When the flag is changed to &ldquo;2&rdquo; in other words when the product is sold at a discount, the discounted price is also stored, linked with the pack ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the aforementioned predetermined amount of time (predetermined term) and the amount of the discount (discount rate) are already set for each product in a discount file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows the data configuration of the discount file. As shown in the figure, the discount time, in other words the time elapsed since the product was processed, and the amount of the discount (discount rate) are linked to each product number. The discount file shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> for the product number 23456 is set so that the product is discounted by 50% after two days have elapsed from the time of processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the discount time is displayed as four digits, wherein the first two digits represent the date and the following two digits indicate the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> For example, if the discount time is set to &ldquo;0112&rdquo; the discount takes effect after one day and twelve hours, and furthermore, if the discount time is set to &ldquo;0004&rdquo; the discount takes effect after four hours. Moreover, this discount file is stored in the store controller SC and the file server FS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the aforementioned sales performance file comprises a file (totaled file) containing data on the total number sold and total value of sales for each product number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when a product is marked for disposal, the flag of the product is changed to &ldquo;3&rdquo; in the manufacturing log file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the marking of a product for disposal can be performed during the process of step <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> described above, or by an employee scanning the pack ID number of a product which has expired using the handy terminal HT on the selling floor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> (3) Manufacturing and Sales Data Preparation and Output Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> This process is performed as required using a device connected to the store controller or the LAN by cable or wireless means, and the prepared results are displayed on a display and output as a printout according to need. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Because the block ID for each pack ID and a flag indicating the sale status is stored in the manufacturing log file, by extracting and totaling data based on the block ID number, a variety of totaled data such as the data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> can be acquired for any block ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> From this totaled data, the type of information listed below can be acquired for any block ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> (1) Manufacturing data, sales data and loss data for each product number, and in total </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the purchase cost for the block ID number in the above formula is stored in the aforementioned raw material block file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, products for which the flag is &ldquo;0&rdquo; after the disposal data has been input are considered lost due to shoplifting or the like, and product loss data can also be totaled for any block ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because data on the date and time of processing is stored in the manufacturing log file for each pack ID, various data can be totaled based on dates and times of processing, and the actual inventory, margins and loss in every process from purchasing to sale can be ascertained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> illustrates a case where 5.3 kg of beef side roast (block ID number&equals;&num;12, weight purchased 5.3 kg, purchase price &yen;12,190) was purchased, and the entire amount was sold during the period of time from the 20th to the 22nd of June.

<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the manufacturing data and sales data processing method of the present embodiment,</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> (1) it is possible to individually manage manufacturing data for each perishable food product, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> (2) it is possible to automate the discounting process, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> (3) it is possible to prevent expired products from being inadvertently sold </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> (4) because flags indicating the manufacturing data, block ID number and sale status for each pack ID number are stored in the manufacturing log file, it is possible for manufacturing data, sales data and loss data to be totaled for each block ID number, and for inventory control, loss management and gross margin management to be performed for each block ID number, and consequently, it is possible to clearly identify the loss in every process from purchasing to sale, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> (5) furthermore, because data on the date and time of manufacture is stored in the manufacturing log file for each pack ID number, a variety of data can be totaled for a given manufacturing period.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Next, a second embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> This second embodiment relates to a pricing and registration processing method for perishable foods, and the general layout of a store in which the present embodiment is employed, and the flow of the data processing in the store, is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Furthermore, the weight label printer DPS and the POS registers PR can have the same electrical configuration, functions and operation as those in the first embodiment, and the data configuration of the PLU file and the manufacturing performance file can also be the same as in the first embodiment. Consequently, those members and elements which were also present in the first embodiment are labeled with the same labels, and the descriptions thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> The operation of the product pricing and registration process according to the present embodiment are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the processes implemented by the present system are separated into</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> (1) a product manufacturing and pricing process, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> (2) a product registration/payment/sales data totaling process, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> (3) a manufacturing and sales data preparation and output process.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> However, because the product manufacturing and pricing process (1) is performed according to the steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in the same manner as in the first embodiment, the product registration/payment/sales data totaling process (2) is performed according to the steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, and the manufacturing and sales data preparation and output process (3) is also performed in the same manner as in the first embodiment, the descriptions thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> A barcode (pack ID barcode) which can individually identify each product is included in the particulars printed on the price label issued in the above product manufacturing and pricing process (1) (step S<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>). As follows, the composition of this barcode according to the present embodiment is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the pack ID barcode according to the present embodiment is a 13 digit one dimensional JAN barcode, wherein the first two digits (1), (2) represent a flag, the third digit (3) represents a machine number, the fourth digit (4) represents the day of the week, the digits from (5) to (8) are a number sequence, the digits from (9) to (12) represent the selling price, and the thirteenth digit (13) is a check digit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> In general, the flag &ldquo;FF&rdquo; can be set to any number from 01 to 99, but in the case of a pack ID barcode, a number which is neither a country code used in a standard PLU barcode, such as &ldquo;49&rdquo; nor a flag used in an ordinary NON-PLU barcode, is used. In other words, a number is used which is not already a flag used in the store. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, this flag data shows that the barcode is a pack ID barcode, and also shows the classification of the product. For example, the numbers &ldquo;03&rdquo; to &ldquo;07&rdquo; could be used as the flags of a pack ID barcode, and defined so that &ldquo;fresh meat&rdquo; is indicated by the flag &ldquo;03&rdquo;, &ldquo;fresh fish&rdquo; is indicated by the flag &ldquo;04&rdquo;, &ldquo;vegetables and fruits&rdquo; are indicated by the flag &ldquo;05&rdquo;, &ldquo;daily dishes&rdquo; are indicated by the flag &ldquo;<highlight><bold>06</bold></highlight>&rdquo;and &ldquo;other products&rdquo; are indicated by the flag &ldquo;07&rdquo;. Moreover, this product classification could also be set to include &ldquo;beef&rdquo;, &ldquo;pork&rdquo;,&ldquo;chicken&rdquo; and &ldquo;other meats&rdquo;, by increasing the number of flags. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, this product classification is preset for each product number in the product file used for pricing (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The machine number (M) shows the machine number of the machine which printed and issued the barcode label for the pack ID number, where &ldquo;1&rdquo; through &ldquo;8&rdquo; indicate a specific pricing device, and &ldquo;9&rdquo; indicates the handy terminal HT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> The day of the week &ldquo;W&rdquo; indicates the day of the week on which the barcode label was printed and issued. &ldquo;0&rdquo; indicates Sunday, &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicates Monday, and . . . &ldquo;6&rdquo; indicates Saturday. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> The number sequence &ldquo;CCCC&rdquo; is a number from &ldquo;0001&rdquo; to &ldquo;<highlight><bold>9999</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. The machines which issue each barcode label (the pricing devices and the handy terminal HT) respectively generate and administer the number sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> The sale price &ldquo;PPPP&rdquo; is a value from &ldquo;0&rdquo; to &ldquo;<highlight><bold>9999</bold></highlight>&rdquo; which indicates the sale price of the product. If the sale price &ldquo;PPPP&rdquo; is &ldquo;0&rdquo; this means that the price of the product is more than four digits long, and can therefore not be displayed in four digits. Normally, it is very rare for the price of perishable foods to be five figures or more, but because it is possible that such expensive items may be sold in special cases such as special end of year or new year sales, for such products the price printed on the price label can be keyed in during product registration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The check digit &ldquo;C/D&rdquo; is data for checking whether or not a barcode has been read correctly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> The numerical value of the six digits from the third to the eighth digit in the aforementioned barcode function as an ID number (pack ID number) for individually identifying weighed products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> By employing such a configuration, because one ID number (pack ID number) is assigned for one weighed product as a barcode, it is possible to individually identify each weighed product. Furthermore, sale price data is also included in each barcode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> (2) Product Registration/Payment/Sales Data Totaling Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> The product registration/payment/sales data totaling process according to the present embodiment is performed according to the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in the same manner as in the first embodiment, but the steps involved in the process of registering a product (step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>) based on the data read from a barcode by the scanner <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the POS register PR are described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows the product registration process performed by reading from the manufacturing log in the manufacturing performance file stored in the store controller SC. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows the product registration process performed when the manufacturing log data cannot be read due to reasons such as the store controller SC being down. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, firstly the barcode attached to the product, in other words the pack ID number (identification information) and price of the product, is read by the scanner <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the POS register PR (step S<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>). Subsequently, once the pack ID number of the product is obtained, manufacturing data (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>) corresponding with this ID number such as the product number and price of the product is retrieved from the manufacturing log file in the manufacturing performance file stored in the store controller SC, via the communication section (step S<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Next, by referring to the expiry date data retrieved from the manufacturing log file, a determination is made as to whether or not a product has expired (step S<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>). Moreover, this determination is made by referring to the date and time of the clock of the POS register PR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> If the product is determined to have expired (&ldquo;YES&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>), a warning is displayed to inform the operator of the POS register PR of this fact. Moreover, a warning sound may also sound at the same time as the warning is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if at step S<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> the product is determined to have not expired (&ldquo;NO&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>), then a determination is made as to whether or not the price data included in the barcode read in step S<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;0&rdquo; (step S<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>). In the case where the price data is &ldquo;0&rdquo; (&ldquo;YES&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>), the price consists of five or more digits and cannot be displayed using only four numerical values, so the operator is requested to key in the price printed on the price label, and the process waits in standby mode until the price data is entered (step S<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> When the determination at step S<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;NO&rdquo; or when the price is entered in step S<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether or not the price P read from the barcode in step S<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, or alternatively the price P input in step S<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, differs from the price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>in the manufacturing log data read in step S<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>). If the prices are different (&ldquo;YES&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>) a discount process in which a label with a different price has been affixed to the product has been performed, and the amount of the discount is calculated by subtracting the price P of the barcode from the price P<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>read from the manufacturing log (step S<highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Subsequently in step S<highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, the registration data, for example the product name, price, amount of discount (if the product is discounted), and the weight and the like, is displayed, and also stored in the receipt buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the sales performance file and the manufacturing performance file are then updated for the registered product. In other words, the registration data is sent to the store controller SC and the manufacturing performance file in the store controller SC is updated, while the flag for the product is changed in the manufacturing log file. Moreover, the registration data which is sent to the store controller SC is, in the case of a nondiscounted product, the product number and price, and in the case of a discounted product is the product number, the price and the amount of the discount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> The process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is performed in the manner described above in those cases in which the manufacturing log data stored in the store controller SC is able to be read and processed during product registration, but the steps involved in the product registration process in those cases in which the manufacturing log data cannot be read, for such reasons as the store controller SC being down or there being problems with the LAN, are described in detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the barcode attached to the product, in other words the pack ID number (identification information) and price of the product, is read by the scanner <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the POS register PR (step S<highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>). The classification of the product is determined from the flag comprising the first two digits of the read barcode, and a classification name is called up (step S<highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>). Moreover, each POS register PR comprises a classification name file in which the classification names corresponding with the classifications (codes) are stored, and the classification name is called up using this file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a determination is made as to whether or not the price data of the barcode read in step S<highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;0 &rdquo;(step S<highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>). In a case where the price data is &ldquo;0&rdquo; (&ldquo;YES&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>), the price consists of five or more digits and cannot be displayed using only four numerical values, so the operator is requested to key in the price printed on the price label, and the process waits in standby mode until the price data is entered (step S<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> When the determination at step S<highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;NO&rdquo;or when the price is entered in step S<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the registration data, for example the classification name and the price, is displayed, and also stored in the receipt buffer (step S<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in step S<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the barcode data (pack ID number and price) of the registered product is stored in the memory of the POS register PR as sales performance data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if communication is possible with the store controller SC, the sales performance data stored in the memory of the POS register PR is sent to the store controller SC, and the sales performance file and the manufacturing log data in the store controller SC are updated respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> (3) Manufacturing and Sales Data Preparation and Output Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> This process is performed in the same manner as in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the manufacturing and sales data processing method of the present embodiment, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> (1) because the product classification and the price are included in the barcode in addition to the pack ID number, the checkout process can be performed based on the read barcode without referring to the manufacturing log data, and in such a case, the classification name of the classification of the product can be displayed and printed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> (2) because the price data is included in the barcode, by affixing a barcode with changed price information over the old barcode, discounting can be performed in the same manner as with conventional NON-PLU barcodes, and if a product is discounted, the amount of the discount can be displayed or printed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Next, a third embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. This third embodiment relates to a pricing and registration system for perishable foods. Moreover, those members and elements which are also present in the first and second embodiments are labeled with the same labels, and the descriptions thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a store layout diagram showing a store selling perishable food products, and corresponds with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> described in the first embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> differs from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in that information output terminals MT which display the manufacturing channel information and the like for perishable foods are provided near the entrance and exit. These information output terminals MT are described below in detail. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a web server WS which is connected to the internet is connected to the local LAN (N<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), and this web server WS is configured so that it is possible to upload various data to external devices via the internet as needed, and also download necessary data from external devices as required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Next, the information output terminal MT is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is an electrical configuration diagram showing the information output terminal MT. The structural elements are almost identical to the POS register PR (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). In other words, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, label <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> indicates a CPU for controlling the entire operation of the information output terminal MT, and as shown in the figure, the other structural elements are connected respectively to this CPU. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Label <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> indicates a display for displaying predetermined information according to display instructions from the CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Label <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> indicates an operation panel comprising an input device for inputting numerical data such as a pack ID number or a raw material block ID number described below, and supplying the input data to the CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> Label <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> indicates a clock for determining the current day, hour, minute and second and supplying this information to the CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Label <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> indicates a printer for printing the manufacturing channel information described below according to instructions from the CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> Label <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> indicates a scanner for reading the barcode attached to a product and supplying the read data to the CPU <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Label <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> indicates a communication section for exchanging data with external devices by communicating via the LAN. The communication section <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is used when, for example, retrieving and displaying the various files stored in the file server FS and the store controller SC and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the PLU file used in the pricing process, the payment performance file and the raw material block file are stored in a memory device (for example RAM) provided in the file server FS (not shown in the figure) in the same manner as in the first and the second embodiment, but in the present embodiment, a manufacturing channel information file is also stored in the memory device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the product pricing and registration process according to the present embodiment is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the processes implemented by the present system are separated into</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> (1) a product manufacturing and pricing process, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> (2) a clearance product discounting process, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> (3) a product registration/payment/sales data totaling process, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> (4) a manufacturing and sales data preparation and output process, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> (5) a manufacturing channel information output process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> However, the processes (1) to (4) are, unless specifically noted, essentially the same as in the first and the second embodiment, and the descriptions thereof are therefore omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as described in the first and second embodiment, the above product manufacturing and pricing process (1) comprises a pricing process in which a price label (barcode label) is issued for a product manufactured from a raw material block and subsequently attached to the product, and a totaling process in which manufacturing data (label issuing data) is totaled, although in this embodiment, the raw material block number (the block ID number) input and set by the person in charge of pricing at step S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which shows an outline of the steps of the pricing and totaling processes, includes not only the date and time of purchase, the raw material block product name, and the raw material block code and the like, but also includes an individual identification code according to the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> The individual identification code is a code for identifying the actual source from which a raw material block was manufactured. For example, if the raw material block is beef, this code is an identification code (cow number) assigned individually to each beef cow. This identification number (cow number) is entered on the shipping ticket of the raw material block at the meat processing plant and is then sent to the store with the raw material block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the individual identification code is included in the data which is entered for each block ID number, sent to the file server FS, and stored in the raw material block file in the file server FS (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the aforementioned totaling process (1), the raw material block file is sent with the totaled manufacturing performance file (the totaled file and the manufacturing log file) to the store controller SC of the POS system via the LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> As described above, the aforementioned product registration/payment/sales data totaling process (3) is performed according to the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in the same manner as in the first and second embodiment, and in the payment process (step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>) in the same figure, a receipt on which are printed the purchase details of the product and payment data is printed by the printer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and passed to the customer with his/her change, but in the present embodiment, if a pack ID product (a product to which a pack ID is assigned) is registered, then the block ID number of the pack ID product is printed in the field for product details on the receipt, together with the product name and price of the product (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</cross-reference>). Moreover, if when registering a product in the manner described below, the manufacturing log data is unable to be retrieved, the pack ID number is printed in the field for product details on the receipt, together with the classification name and price and the like of the pack ID product (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the product registration/payment/sales data totaling process in the present embodiment is performed according to the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in the same manner as the first embodiment, but the steps involved in the process of registering a product based on the data read from the barcode by the scanner <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the POS register PR (step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>) are the same as in the second embodiment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned manufacturing and sales data preparation and output process (4) is performed in the same manner as in the first and second embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> (5) Manufacturing Channel Information Output Process</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Next, the manufacturing channel information output process is described. In this process, a customer can use an information output terminal MT installed in the store to display or print the manufacturing channel information for the product (pack ID product) he/she has bought or wishes to buy. In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, the memory devices of the store controller SC and the file server FS are used to store a manufacturing channel data file (SDF) which contains manufacturing channel information such as the (1) species, (2) sex, (3) date of birth, (4) farm of birth (code), (5) ID code of sire, (6) ID code of birth cow, (7) farm (code) at which animal was raised, and for how long, (8) meat processing plant, and (9) the date of processing and the like of the meat source (meat cow) for each individual identification code (cow number), together with a farm data file (BDF) which contains the farm name (processing plant name), address, telephone number, and name of the person in charge and the like for each farm code or processing plant code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> The data in these data files SDF and SBF may be made into a database in the store, but by establishing an individual identification code administration center for the entire industry, gathering and managing each piece of data at the administration center as a database, and then not performing any transaction involving a beef cow for which data is not present in the administration center, the gathering and administration of data can be kept accurate and reliable. Furthermore, if needed, the manufacturing channel data file (SDF) and the farm data file (BDF) can be downloaded from the administration center via the internet, and stored in the memory devices of the store controller SC and the file server FS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> When a customer wants to know the manufacturing channel information for a pack ID product which he/she has purchased, he/she inputs the raw material block ID number or the pack ID number printed on the receipt into the operation panel <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the information output terminal MT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in a case where the purchased product is at hand, or if a customer wants to know the manufacturing channel information for a product which he/she wishes to buy, the pack ID number can be input by reading the barcode of the product using the scanner <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Once the pack ID number is input, the information output terminal MT retrieves the raw material block ID number for this pack ID number from the manufacturing log file in the store controller SC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> The individual identification code is then retrieved from the raw material block file in the store controller SC based on the aforementioned input block ID number or the retrieved raw material block ID number. The manufacturing channel data for the retrieved individual identification code is then retrieved from the manufacturing channel data file (SDF), and after referring to the data in the farm data file (BDF), this manufacturing channel data is displayed on the display <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>). The customer then checks the data displayed on the display <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and if the customer desires a printout, he/she can print the data using the printer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> by pressing a print command key provided on the operation panel <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the above description describes a case where the customer displays or prints the manufacturing channel data of a purchased pack ID product by operating the information output terminal MT installed in the store, but the composition of the present invention allows the contents of the aforementioned manufacturing channel data file (SDF) and the farm data file (BDF) to be called up from a web server WS via the internet and displayed using the browser software of a home PC. Consequently, if the customer wants to check the manufacturing channel information for the purchased pack ID product after he/she returns home, he/she can do so at any time by connecting to the home page of the store where the product was purchased using his/her home PC. For this purpose, the home page address of the store is printed in the store information field on the receipt (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the product pricing and registration system of the present embodiment, either the raw material block ID number or the pack ID number are printed in the purchased product information field on the receipt, and so if the customer so desires, he/she can check the manufacturing channel information for the purchased product (pack ID product) using either the information output terminal MT installed in the store or his/her home PC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> The product discounting system is described as a fourth embodiment. This discounting system constitutes a part of a product manufacturing data and sales data processing system which performs (1) a product manufacturing and pricing process, (2) a clearance products discounting process, (3) a product registration payment/sales data totaling process, and (4) a manufacturing and sales data preparation and output process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> In the discounting system of the present invention, the pack ID Number (ID number) is read from a displayed product which is to be discounted (clearance product) using a handy terminal HT (terminal), and the discount data or discounted price of the product which was input into the handy terminal HT is sent with the read ID number from the handy terminal HT to the file server FS (administration device), and is also stored in the file server FS (memory device). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the product discounting system according to the present embodiment, at the checkout, the pack ID number is read from the price label of the product, and a determination is made as to whether or not discount data or a discounted price is stored in the file server FS linked with this pack ID number, and if so, the product is registered based on this discount data or discounted price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Here, it is preferable that the handy terminal HT can accept the input of discount data or a discounted price at the point in time when the pack ID number of the displayed product to be discounted is read by the handy terminal HT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Here, the point in time at which the handy terminal HT reads the pack ID number includes a time range extending a predetermined length of time before the ID was read, or a time range extending a predetermined length of time past the ID was read, or a time range extending in both these directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> Next, the specific configuration of the product discounting method and discounting system is described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment relates to a discounting method and the like for perishable foods. The general layout of the store in which the present embodiment is employed and the system configuration relating to the flow of the data processing in the store is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Furthermore, the weight label printer DPS and the POS registers PR can have the same electrical composition, functions and operation (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and others) as those in the first embodiment, and the data configuration and the like of the PLU file and the manufacturing performance file can also be the same as the first embodiment. Consequently, those members and elements which are also present in the first embodiment are labeled with the same labels, and the descriptions thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> The handy terminal HT according to the present embodiment is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> is an electrical composition diagram showing the handy terminal HT. In the figure, label <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> indicates a CPU for controlling the entire operation of the information output terminal MT, and as shown in the figure, the other structural elements are connected to this CPU.

Label <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> indicates a RAM used in the arithmetic processing of the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Label <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> indicates a liquid crystal touch panel display having a display function for displaying predetermined information according to display instructions received from the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and a data input function. In other words, the liquid crystal touch panel display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has a function whereby data is input by detecting, when the liquid crystal display panel is touched, the position at which the panel was touched, and the operations of inputting and transmitting discount data, and of inverting the &ldquo;automatic flag&rdquo; which indicates the &ldquo;ON/OFF&rdquo; state of the function for automatically sending the input discount data (or the discounted price) and the pack ID number (ID number) for individually identifying each product to the weight pricing system (administration device) can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> Label <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> indicates a scanner for reading the barcode on the label affixed to the product, and supplying the data thereof to the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Label <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> indicates a wireless transceiver for communicating with a transceiver TR of the weight pricing system by means of wireless communication. Moreover, the wireless transceiver <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may also communicate via cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the product discounting system according to the present embodiment is described. The processes implemented by the present system are separated into</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> (1) a product manufacturing and pricing process, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> (2) a clearance product discounting process, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> (3) a product registration/payment/sales data totaling process, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> (4) a manufacturing and sales data preparation and output process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> Because the product manufacturing and pricing process (1) is performed according to the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in the same manner as in the first embodiment, the product registration/payment/sales data totaling process (3) is performed according to the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, and the manufacturing and sales data preparation and output process (4) is performed in the same manner as in the first and second embodiments, detailed descriptions thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</cross-reference> are diagrams showing the data configuration of the manufacturing performance file according to the present embodiment, and corresponds with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> described in the first embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> differs from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> in that data entries for the amount of the discount of the product, the discounted price and the sales price are provided in the second file (the manufacturing log file) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the same manner as in the first embodiment, the aforementioned manufacturing performance file (the totaled file and the manufacturing log file) is sent to the store controller SC of the POS system via the LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> (2) Clearance Product Discounting Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> The discounting process for clearance products is performed using the handy terminal HT. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing the operation of the handy terminal HT, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> is a schematic drawing showing the appearance of a clearance product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the employee (person in charge) views the expiry dates on the price labels <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> affixed to the products <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> displayed in the store, and searches for products which are nearing their expiry date or for which the product value has dropped (clearance products). The employee then decides the amount of the discount for the clearance products which he/she has found, and enters the amount of the discount (discount data) into the handy terminal HT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the handy terminal HT determines whether or not the discount data has been input (step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> If step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;YES&rdquo; (meaning that discount data has been input), the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> stores the input discount data in a predetermined area in the RAM <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> If step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;NO&rdquo; (meaning that discount data has not been input), or if the process of step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has finished, the employee reads the pack ID barcode <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> from the price label <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> on the product <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> using the scanner <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the handy terminal HT, and the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the barcode is a valid barcode showing a pack ID number, rather than a barcode wherein the flag shows the country code or a NON-PLU code (step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> If step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;NO&rdquo; (when the barcode is not valid), a determination is made as to whether or not the operation for inverting the &ldquo;automatic flag&rdquo; which indicates the &ldquo;ON/OFF&rdquo;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the function for automatically sending the discount data and the pack ID number to the weight pricing system has been performed (step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). If step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;YES&rdquo; the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> inverts the &ldquo;automatic flag&rdquo; (for example the &ldquo;automatic flag&rdquo; is changed from OFF to ON) (step S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). If step S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;NO&rdquo; the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> does nothing, and the process returns to step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> If step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;YES&rdquo; (when the barcode is valid), then the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> performs manufacturing data retrieval in which the manufacturing data (data comprising the product data, product name, original price, amount of discount, discounted price, expiry data and the like (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>)) corresponding with the pack ID number is received from the file server FS, by sending the pack ID number in the read barcode information to the file server FS of the weight pricing system (step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> After step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the &ldquo;automatic flag&rdquo; is &ldquo;ON&rdquo; (automatic transmission mode) (step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> If step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;NO&rdquo; (when automatic transmission mode is off), then the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> displays the product name, original price, amount of discount, discounted price, expiry data and the like included in the manufacturing data (the data retrieved in step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) of the product indicated by the barcode read in step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, on the liquid crystal touch panel display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so that the employee can check the manufacturing data (step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> After step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the employee who viewed the display in step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> has determined that the discount data needs to be changed, and performed the operation to change the discount data using the liquid crystal touch panel display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> If step S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;YES&rdquo; (when the operation to change the discount data has been performed), then the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> replaces the discount data stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with the discount data changed in step S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> When the process in step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has finished or if step S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;NO&rdquo; (the operation to change the discount data has not been performed), the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the employee has performed the operation which executes the transmission of the discount data (the operation which executes the discount) using the liquid crystal touch panel display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> If step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;YES&rdquo; (the operation to execute the discount has been performed) or if step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;YES&rdquo; (automatic transmission mode is enabled), the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> sends the pack ID number and the discount data of the product indicated by the barcode read in step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the file server FS (the administration device and the memory device) (step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). The process then returns to step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> The employee completes the discounting process by affixing a POP label <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, which is a discount sticker displaying the same value as the discount data input in step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or step <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> (for example &ldquo;50 yen off&rdquo; ), to the product to be discounted (the product which underwent the discounting process in step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> through step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> Consequently, when performing the product discounting process, by using the handy terminal HT of the present embodiment, it is not necessary for the employee to take a label printer onto the selling floor and issue barcode labels showing the discounted price on the selling floor, and in addition, it is also not necessary to affix the barcode label over the barcode on the original price label of the product, and the operation required to discount the product can thus be simplified and takes considerably less time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> If the discount data is the same for a plurality of products, then because the discount data, once stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, remains stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> even after being transmitted in step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, by setting the &ldquo;automatic flag&rdquo; to &ldquo;ON&rdquo; and enabling the automatic transmission mode, the discounting process can be performed by simply reading the barcode of the product to be discounted using the scanner <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the handy terminal HT. In other words, in the discounting process in step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the employee needs only to read the barcode of the product to be discounted in step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the greater the number of products for which the same discount data is applied, the simpler the operation required to discount the products becomes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> (3) Product Registration Payment Totaling Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> The product registration/payment totaling process according to the present embodiment is performed according to the steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in the same manner as in the first embodiment, but the steps involved in the product registration process in step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> shows the product registration process as performed by reading the manufacturing log from the manufacturing performance file stored in the store controller SC. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, firstly the barcode attached to the product, in other words the pack ID number (identification information) and the price, is read by the scanner <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the POS register PR (step S<highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>). Consequently, once the pack ID number is obtained, manufacturing data (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>) such as the product number and price and the like for the product which corresponds with the ID number is retrieved from the manufacturing log file in the manufacturing performance file stored in the store controller SC, via the communication section (step S<highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a determination is made as to whether or not the expiry date has passed by referring to the retrieved expiry date data (step S<highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>). Moreover, this determination is made by referring to the date and time of the clock of the POS register PR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> If the product is determined to have expired (&ldquo;YES&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>), a warning is displayed to inform the operator of the POS register PR of this fact. Moreover, a warning sound may also sound at the same time as the warning is displayed. (The process up to this point is the same as in the first embodiment). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if at step S<highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> the product is determined to have not expired (&ldquo;NO&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>), then a determination is made as to whether or not the discount data read in step S<highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is valid data (step S<highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>). If the discount data is determined to be valid (&ldquo;YES&rdquo; in step S<highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>), the aforementioned discounting process has been performed, and the discount is then subtracted from the price P<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> read from the manufacturing log data to obtain the discounted price, and the price is changed to the discounted price (step S<highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, or alternatively if step S<highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> returns &ldquo;NO&rdquo;product registration is performed in step S<highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>, and the registration data, for example the product name, price, amount of discount (if a discount is applied), weight and the like is displayed, and also stored in the receipt buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, the sales performance file and the manufacturing performance file are updated for the registered product. In other words, the registration data is sent to the store controller SC, and while the manufacturing performance file in the store controller SC is updated, the flag for the product in question is changed in the aforementioned manufacturing log file. Moreover, the registration data which is sent to the store controller SC is the product name and price in the case of a non-discounted product, and is the product name, the price and the amount of the discount in the case of a discounted product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the aforementioned manufacturing performance file is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, and comprises a file (totaled file) in which data on the total number of sales and data on the total monetary value of sales is linked to each product number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> (Other Embodiments) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the case of the first to the fourth embodiments described above, the sales data and the disposal data for each pack ID number are totaled using the flag provided in the manufacturing log file which indicates the sale status of the product, but this data may also be totaled using the sales performance log file in which the pack ID numbers of sold products are stored (if the product was sold at a discount, the amount of the discount or the discounted price are also stored therein) and the disposal product log file in which the pack ID numbers of products marked for disposal are stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> Even in this case, by extracting the same block ID number and pack ID number from the manufacturing log file, and searching the sales performance log file and the disposal products log file based on this pack ID number, a variety of data can be extracted and totaled for each block ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the method of totaling sales data and disposal data for each pack ID number is not limited to the methods described in the above embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the embodiments above were described for the case of perishable food products which do not have a constant price, but the present invention can also be employed for fixed price products if those products are manufactured by processing a raw material block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> However, because the price is constant for fixed price products, the price can be determined by referring to the product pricing file (PLU file), and therefore price data does not need to be stored in the manufacturing log file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when each product is not weighed individually, weight data is not stored in the manufacturing log file, but it is possible to weigh each product and store the resulting weight data in the manufacturing log file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the conf (13 digit code) of the barcode in the present invention includes data on the date and time of processing, but the present invention is not limited to this configuration, and for example, in the barcode configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the data on the date and time of processing, which extends from the 6th to the 11th digit, can be omitted, and a one digit label printer machine number code which specifies a label printer can be added instead (8 digit code). In this case, the number sequence is set to append a number sequence from each label printer. Furthermore, because data on the date and time of processing is registered in the manufacturing log file linked with each ID number, this data can be obtained by referring to the PLU file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present invention, because each perishable food product is individually identified by means of the pack ID number, the following application is also possible. In other words, transaction data (detailed information on the registered products and payment information) for each customer who has gone through the checkout process at a POS register PR is stored as an electronic journal (electronic log) in the POS register PR and the store controller SC for a predetermined length of time. When a customer brings a product to the store wishing to return it, or wants to check the transaction data, the electronic log can be called up and displayed. Conventionally, by inputting the receipt number printed on the receipt, the transaction data for this receipt number was called up and displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> When a product bearing a pack ID number is registered, if the pack ID number is also stored with the electronic log data, then by inputting the pack ID number, transaction data including the product bearing this pack ID number can be retrieved from the electronic log data and displayed, and the desired transaction data can therefore be called up without entering the receipt number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> Consequently, when a customer wishes to return a pack ID product, the returns process can be performed without the customer having to bring the receipt. (Moreover, because it is possible that the same pack ID number may be reused after a predetermined period of time, if entering a pack ID number returns more than one set of transaction data, the most recent transaction data is displayed preferentially). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the third embodiment described above, the receipt is issued by being printed by a printer, but instead of printing, the receipt can be issued by writing the receipt data to a recording medium carried by the customer, by transmission by e-mail, or by transmission by FAX. Of course, any combination of these methods may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the embodiments described above, the block ID number or the pack ID number were printed on the receipt, but during product registration the manufacturing channel data could also be retrieved based on the pack ID number, and printed directly on the receipt. In this case, the manufacturing channel data is only printed on the receipts of those customers who request it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> If a customer administration system is in place, then by setting in the customer data whether or not a customer requires the manufacturing channel information to be printed, it is possible to automatically determine whether or not the information should be printed by inputting a customer number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the example used in the embodiments described above was beef, but the manufacturing channel data for other meats such as pork, lamb and poultry, or for fish or vegetables and fruits may also be stored against a block ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the storage of the manufacturing channel data is not limited to any specific storage method, provided that the data is stored linked with the block ID number and can be retrieved based on the block ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the fourth embodiment described above, the fact that a product is discounted can be indicated by any of the following methods.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> (1) If the desired discount process is the same for all the products of the same type on a specific shelf, then the discount may be displayed on the shelf itself, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> (2) the discount may be hand written in red marker on the price label, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> (3) an indication that a product is discounted may be printed using a simple printer which does not print a barcode, and affixed to each product, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> (4) if there is only one type of discount or only several types, an employee can carry either one or several stamps with which he/she stamps the price labels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the aforementioned embodiment, the handy terminal HT may comprise the stamp or the simple printer described above for indicating that a product is discounted, or a function for issuing a barcode label (a barcode showing the discounted price and the like) of the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is convenient and advantageous if the handy terminal HT is also equipped with other modes which comprise functions for checking product data, reordering products, and checking performance and the like, in addition to the discounting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the discounting process for clearance products may be structured so that the handy terminal sends the data for a plurality of products together instead of communicating with the administration device for each product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the aforementioned embodiments, the discount process is not limited to a configuration wherein the discount data is input directly, and configurations in which the discounted price or a discount percentage are input may also be used instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> Having now fully described the invention, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth herein. </paragraph>
