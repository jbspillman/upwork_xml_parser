<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a rotor having a weight that swings like a pendulum and to a compressor that uses the rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 6-193684 discloses a rotor having a flywheel, in which a weight guide (weight receptacle) is defined. A weight (damper mass) is accommodated in the weight guide (weight receptacle). The weight rolls in the weight receptacle. A projection having a rectangular cross-section is formed in one of the weight guide and the weight. A groove having a rectangular cross section is formed in the other one of the guide and the weight. The projection and the groove extend along the rolling direction of the weight and engage with each other. The engagement of the projection and the groove prevents the weight from moving in the axial direction of the rotor. Thus, the weight does not collide with the walls of the weight guide, which suppresses the noise due to collision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, a clearance must be created between the projection and the groove to allow the weight to swing like a pendulum. The clearance permits the weight to move in the axial direction. The weight therefore chatters and produces noise. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a major objective of the present invention to provide a rotor that suppresses resonance by pendulum-like motion of a weight accommodated in a weight guide and reduces noise produced by collision of the weight against the walls of the receptacle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a compressor that uses the rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To achieve the foregoing and other objectives and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, a rotor has a main body including a rotation axis, a weight guide recessed in the main body, said weight guide having a weight guide surface and a weight that is accommodated in the weight guide and contacts with and rolls on a weight guiding surface. The weight swings like a pendulum about a second axis. The second axis is parallel to and offset from the rotation axis. The weight guiding surface guides the weight to keep the weight moving within the guiding surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A compressor C according to one embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The left end of the compressor C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is defined as the front of the compressor, and the right end is defined as the rear of the compressor C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the compressor C includes a cylinder block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a front housing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a rear housing member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The front housing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is secured to the front end of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The rear housing member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is secured to the rear end of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in between. The cylinder block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the front housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the rear housing member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> form the housing of the compressor C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The cylinder block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the front housing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> define a crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in between. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A rotary shaft, which is a drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, is housed in the compressor housing and extends through the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A cylindrical support <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed at the front end of the front housing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The front end portion of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extends through the front wall of the front housing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is located in the cylindrical support <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The front end portion of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is coupled to an external drive source, which is a vehicular engine E in this embodiment, by a rotor, which is a pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, and a belt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> wound around the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is coupled to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is located in the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> rotates integrally with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A cam plate, which is a swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, is housed in the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> slides along and inclines with respect to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is coupled to the lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by the hinge mechanism <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> permits the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to rotate integrally with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to incline with respect to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> while sliding along the rotation axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A snap ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fitted about the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> extends between the snap ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The snap ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> limit the minimum inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At the minimum inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the angle defined by the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is closest to ninety degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (only one is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are formed in the cylinder block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are located about the rotation axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A single-headed piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is reciprocally housed in each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The front and rear openings of each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are closed by the associated piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A compression chamber is defined in each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The volume of the compression chamber changes according to the reciprocation of the corresponding piston <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is coupled to the peripheral portion of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a pair of shoes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. When the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated by rotation of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the shoes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> converts the rotation into reciprocation of each piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the hinge mechanism <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the pistons <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the shoes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> form a piston type compression mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Sets of suction ports <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and suction valve flaps <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and sets of discharge ports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and discharge valve flaps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed in the valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Each set of the suction port <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the corresponding suction valve flap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and each set of the discharge port <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the corresponding discharge valve flap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> correspond to one of the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (compression chambers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A suction chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are defined in the rear housing member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The front ends of the suction chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are closed by the valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As each piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> moves from the top dead center position to the bottom dead center position, refrigerant gas is drawn into the corresponding cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (compression chamber) through the corresponding suction port <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> while flexing the suction valve flap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to an open position. Low pressure refrigerant gas that is drawn into the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is compressed to a predetermined pressure as the piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is moved from the bottom dead center position to the top dead center position. Then, the gas is discharged to the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through the corresponding discharge port <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> while flexing the discharge valve flap <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to an open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The suction chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is connected to the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by an external refrigerant circuit (not shown). Refrigerant that is discharged from the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> flows into the external refrigerant circuit. The external refrigerant circuit performs heat exchange using the refrigerant. When discharged from the external refrigerant circuit, the refrigerant is drawn into the suction chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Then, the refrigerant is drawn into each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be compressed again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A bleed passage <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed in the housing to connect the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with the suction chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed in the housing to connect the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A control valve <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is located in the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to regulate the opening degree of the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The opening of the control valve <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is adjusted to control the flow rate of highly pressurized gas supplied to the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The pressure in the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (crank chamber pressure Pc) is determined by the ratio of the gas supplied to the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the flow rate of refrigerant gas conducted out from the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the bleed passage <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. As the crank chamber pressure Pc varies, the difference between the crank chamber pressure Pc and the pressure in the compression chambers varies, which changes the inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the stroke of each piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, or the compressor displacement, is varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is located about and rotatably supported by the support cylinder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a bearing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is also fixed to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to rotate integrally with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> includes a main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (rotor main body). The pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a boss <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, which is fitted about the outer ring of the bearing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and a belt receiving portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which is wound around the belt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Two weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are formed between the boss <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the belt receiving portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are symmetrically arranged with respect to the rotation axis of the main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is formed in each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. A cross section of the weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> along a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is arcuate. The center of curvature of the weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> coincides with a line that extends parallel to and is spaced from the rotation axis of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by a predetermined distance R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Each weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is formed at a side of the corresponding weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> that is close to the periphery of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A weight guiding path, which is a groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A in this embodiment, extends along the circumferential direction of each weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, or in the direction along which a weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> rolls. The cross section of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A along a plane containing the center of curvature of the weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (cross section shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)) is arcuate. The radius of curvature of each groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A represented by r<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Arcuate inner surfaces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B are formed at the front and rear sides of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A in each weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The arcuate inner surfaces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B form parts of the inner surface of a common imaginary cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An auxiliary guiding surface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is formed in each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The auxiliary guiding surface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is separated from the arcuate inner surfaces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B toward the axis of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by a predetermined distance. As viewed from the front side of the compressor C, each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> appears as an arc having a constant width with its middle portion located closer to the periphery of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> than its ends. As viewed from the front side of the compressor C, each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is symmetrical with respect to an imaginary line that contains the rotation axis of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the center of the corresponding imaginary cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Each of the grooves <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A has a substantially U-shape in cross section. In other words, the edge of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A extending to form the U-shape is inclined with respect to the axis of the pendulum motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A weight, which is a rigid weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, is accommodated in each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The mass of each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is referred to as m<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is slightly less than the distance between the arcuate inner surfaces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B and the auxiliary guiding surface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is equal to the doubled radius r<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of curvature of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. The axial size of each groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A is slightly less than the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> so that substantially a half of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is fitted in the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. Each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> linearly contacts the corresponding groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A with a part (substantially a half) fitted in the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. In this state, the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> moves along the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> An annular cover <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is fixed to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by screws (not shown) to cover the receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Even if the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are dislocated from the grooves <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A, the cover <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> prevents the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> from falling off the receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the cover <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> form weight guides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When the compressor C is being driven by the engine E, or when the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is rotating, the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> linearly contact the grooves <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A due to the centrifugal force (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). If a torque is generated by rotational fluctuation of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> reciprocates along the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A in the corresponding weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. In other words, the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, or its center of gravity, swings like a pendulum about the center of curvature of the corresponding weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. That is, each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> acts as a centrifugal pendulum when the compressor C is being driven by the engine E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The size and weight of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the locations of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are determined such that the torque fluctuation is suppressed by pendulum motion of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The settings of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which function as centrifugal pendulums, will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> suppress torque fluctuation. Specifically, each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> suppresses a fluctuation band at a frequency that is equal to the characteristic frequency of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (centrifugal pendulum). Therefore, the location, the size, and the weight of each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are determined such that the characteristic frequency of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is set equal to the frequency of a peak component of the torque fluctuation. Accordingly, the amplitude of the peak component is suppressed, and the influence of the torque fluctuation is effectively reduced. Peak components of the torque fluctuation represent the peaks of the fluctuation band, or the components of rotation order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The frequency of the torque fluctuation and the characteristic frequency of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are proportional to the angular velocity &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The frequency of the torque fluctuation when its band is greatest is represented by the product of the rotation speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> per unit time (&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/2) and the number N of the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. That is, the frequency is represented by the formula (&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/2&pgr;) N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Through experiments, it was confirmed that an nth greatest peak (n is a natural number) of the torque fluctuation has a value equal to a product n&middot;(&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/2&pgr;)&middot;N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The characteristic frequency of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is obtained by multiplying the rotation speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> per unit time (&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/2&pgr;) with the square root of the ratio R/r. The sign R represents the distance between the rotation axis of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the axis of the pendulum motion of each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The sign r represents the distance between the axis of the pendulum motion of each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the center of gravity of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Therefore, by equalizing the square root of the ratio R/r with the product n&middot;N, the characteristic frequency of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are equal to the frequency of the nth greatest peak of the torque fluctuation. Accordingly, the torque fluctuation at the nth greatest peak is suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> To suppress the greatest peak of the torque fluctuation, the values of the distances R and r are determined such that the square root of the ratio R/r is equal to N, or the value of the product n&middot;N when n is one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The torque produced about the rotation axis of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is represented by a sign T. To effectively reduce the torque fluctuation by the pendulum motion of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the torque T needs to counter the torque fluctuation and the range of the torque T needs to be equal to the range of the fluctuation. When the frequency of a peak of the torque fluctuation is equal to the characteristic frequency of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the torque T is represented by the following equation. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T&equals;m</italic></highlight>&middot;(&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&middot;(<highlight><italic>R&plus;r</italic></highlight>)&middot;<highlight><italic>R&middot;&phgr;</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the equation 1, the sign m represents the total mass of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (m&equals;2m<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), and &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>represents the average angular velocity of the swing balls when the balls swing in a minute angle &phgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the mass m is maximized to minimize the values R, r, and &phgr;, so that the size of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is minimized, and the torque T is maximized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The center of curvature of each weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> coincides with the axis of the pendulum motion of the corresponding ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. That is, the distance R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>between the rotation axis of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the center of curvature of each weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> corresponds to the distance R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The settings are determined by regarding the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as a particle at the center of gravity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The operation of the compressor C will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> When the power of the engine E is supplied to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates integrally with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates, each piston <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> reciprocates in the associated cylinder bore <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by a stroke corresponding to the inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As a result, suction, compression and discharge of refrigerant gas are repeated in the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> If the opening degree of the control valve <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is decreased, the flow rate of highly pressurized gas supplied to the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is decreased. Accordingly, the crank chamber pressure Pc is lowered and the inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is increased. As a result, the displacement of the compressor C is increased. If the opening degree of the control valve <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is increased, the flow rate of highly pressurized gas supplied to the crank chamber <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through the supply passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is increased. Accordingly, the crank chamber pressure Pc is raised and the inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is decreased. As a result, the displacement of the compressor C is decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> During rotation of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the compression reaction force of refrigerant and reaction force of reciprocation of the pistons <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are transmitted to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the hinge mechanism <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which torsionally (rotationally) vibrates the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The torsional vibrations generate torque fluctuation. The torque fluctuation causes the compressor C to resonate. The torque fluctuation also produces resonance between the compressor C and rotary machines (the engine E and auxiliary devices), which are connected to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by the belt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the torque fluctuation is produced, the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> start swinging like pendulums. The pendulum motion of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> produces torque about the rotation axis of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The produced torque suppresses the torque fluctuation. The characteristic frequency of each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is equal to the frequency of the greatest peak of the torque fluctuation. Therefore, the peak of the torque fluctuation is suppressed, which effectively reduces the torque fluctuation of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. As a result, the resonance produced by the torque fluctuation is effectively suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment has the following advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> (1) The weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are provided in the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The axis of each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is spaced from the rotation axis of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by the predetermined distance R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and is parallel to the rotation axis of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> swings like a pendulum about its axis. The pendulum motion of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> suppresses the torsional vibration of the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which suppresses resonance produced in the compressor C. Further, the pendulum motion suppresses resonance produced between the compressor C and the rotary machines that are coupled to the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by the belt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> (2) The groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A is formed in each weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. A cross section of each groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A along a plane containing the axis of pendulum motion of the corresponding weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is substantially U-shaped. In the other words, the cross section of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A is not parallel, or inclined to the axis of the pendulum motion. The weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is pressed against the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A by centrifugal force, which prevents the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> from moving in the axial direction. Therefore, the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is prevented from colliding with the inner walls of the weight guide, which reduces the noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> (3) Each groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A, which contacts one of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, has an arcuate cross section along a plane containing the axis of the pendulum motion. The radius r<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of curvature of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A is equal to a half of the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, or the radius of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> swings along the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A, there is no clearance between the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A that permits the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to move axially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> (4) The axial size of each groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A is slightly less than the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> so that substantially a half of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is fitted in the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. Compared to a case in which the axial size of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A is narrower, a greater part of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is located in the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A when the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> swings along the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. Therefore, the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is less likely to be dislocated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Particularly, it should be understood that the invention may be embodied in the following forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the cross section of each groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A along the plane containing the axis of the pendulum motion is arcuate. The axial size of each groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A is determined such that a half of the corresponding weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is received by the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. However, the axial size of each groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A may be changed. For example, the axial size of each groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A may be determined such that a smaller portion of the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is received by the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the weight guides (the weight receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>) are arcuate and have a constant width when viewed from the front side of the compressor C. However, the shape of each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> may be changed. As long as each weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> has a weight guiding surface, the shape of the weight receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> may be changed, for example, to a circular shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of each weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is equal to the doubled radius r<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of curvature of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. However, the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>may be changed. For example, the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>may be less than the doubled radius r<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. In this case, even if an external force in the axial direction of the pendulum motion is applied to the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> remains contacting the surface of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A and reciprocates along the width of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. That is, noise due to collision between the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A is prevented. If the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is greater than the doubled radius r<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is prevented from moving in the axial direction by the edges of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), each groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A, which contacts the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, has an arcuate cross section along a plane containing the axis of the pendulum motion. However, the cross section of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A may be U-shaped. In other words, the cross section of the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A may be changed as long as there is no clearance between the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A that permits the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to move axially when the weight ball <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> swings along the groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the cross section of part of each weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> along the plane containing the axis of the pendulum motion is arcuate. However, at least part of each weight guiding surface may include an inclined surface and formed as a projection or a groove that extends along the reciprocation direction of the weight. In this case, the outer shape of the weight is preferably shaped to fit the projection or the groove formed in the weight receptacle. FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) describe weight receptacles of such embodiments. FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) are cross-sectional views of the cover <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, weight receptacles <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> forming weight guides, and weights, which are rollers (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>) located in the weight receptacles (<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>) taken along a plane containing the axis of the pendulum motion of the rollers (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The weight receptacle <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) has a weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A. Inclined sections <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>C are formed in the axial ends of the weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A. Therefore, the weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A is formed as a groove extending along the reciprocation direction of the substantially cylindrical roller <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. An arcuate surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>D is formed between the inclined section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>C. The arcuate surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>D is a part of an imaginary cylinder the center of which coincides with the axis of the pendulum motion.

Inclined sections <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>C are formed in the guiding surface <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>A. Therefore, the weight guiding surface <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>A is formed as a groove extending along the reciprocation direction of the roller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The inclined sections <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>C are adjacent to each other. The roller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has an annular projection <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A.

Inclined sections <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>C are formed in the guiding surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A. Therefore, the guiding surface <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A is formed as a projection extending along the reciprocation direction of the roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The inclined sections <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>C are adjacent to each other. The roller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has an annular groove <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>A. The groove <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>A fits on the projection defined by the inclined sections <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>C. In the embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the engagement between the weight and the groove or the projection prevents the weight from being displaced in the axial direction. Therefore, the weight is prevented from colliding with the inner walls of the weight guide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed by coupling two pieces the boundary of which is shown by broken lines. The pulley pieces are molded by dies that move along the axial direction of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and then coupled to each other. Therefore, undercuts are not formed. This facilitates the forming of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and reduces the cost. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) is cross-sectional view of the cover <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, a weight receptacle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> forming a weight guide, and a weight, which is a roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, located in the weight receptacles <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> taken along the plane containing the axis of the pendulum motion of the roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The weight receptacle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> includes a roller guiding surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>A. The roller guiding surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>A is inclined that the weight receptacle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is radially widened toward the open end (the left end as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>)). The roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> swings along the guide <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>A like a pendulum. The roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is formed as a frustum. The circumference of the roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is inclined such that the roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> linearly contacts the guide <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> When the roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is swinging along the guiding surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>A, the front end (the left end as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>)) of the roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> contacts the cover <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, which is located at the open end of the weight receptacle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The contact between the guiding surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>A and the circumference of the roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> prevents the roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> from moving rearward (rightward as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>)). Also, the contact between the cover <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the front surface of the roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> prevents the roller <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> from moving forward. Therefore, the weight is prevented from colliding with the inner walls of the weight guide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is molded by dies that move along the axial direction of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The guide <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>A is formed when the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is molded. Therefore, undercuts are not formed. This facilitates the forming of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and reduces the cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the weight receptacle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is radially widened toward the open end. However, the weight receptacle <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> may be narrowed toward the open end. In this case, the weight (roller) is prevented from moving in the axial direction by the guiding surface and the wall that faces the cover <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the weight is formed like a fulcrum linearly contacts the guiding surface. However, the weight may be spherical and in point contact with the guiding surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> For example, an axial projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> may be formed on either side of the weight (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) as illustrated by broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). In this case, when the weight moves in the axial direction, the projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> contact the inner walls of the weight guide. Therefore, compared to a case where there is no axial projections like projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the entire axial surfaces contact the inner walls when the weight moves axially, the weight having the projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> contacts the inner walls at smaller areas and produces less noise. In other words, the noise is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the square root of the ratio R/r is equal to N, which is the value of n&middot;N when the n is one. However, the square root of the ratio R/r may be the value of n&middot;N when n is a natural number that is greater than one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has two weight guides each accommodating a weight. However, the number of the weight guides may be changed. The number of the weight guides need not correspond to the number of the cylinder bores of the compressor C. If the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has only one mass, the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may have a balancer such as a weight or a thinned portion to prevent the center of gravity of the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from being displaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> If the pulley main body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has two or more weights, the ratio R/r of the weights may be different. Since there is two or more values of the ratios R/r of the weights, the bands of two or more peaks (rotation order) of the torque fluctuation are suppressed. In this case, the values n are preferably selected from numbers in order from one. For example, when three numbers are selected, one, two and three are preferably used. Accordingly, the square roots of the ratios R/r correspond to the numbers represented by the products n&middot;N, in which the value n is one, two and three. Therefore, the three greatest peaks of the torque fluctuation are suppressed. That is, the resonance is effectively suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the settings are determined by regarding each weight as a particle at the center of gravity. However, the settings are preferably determined by taking the inertial mass of each weight into consideration. For example, in the case of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the settings are preferably made based on the ratio 5R/7r instead on the ratio R/r so that the inertial mass of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are taken into consideration. When the frequency of a peak of the torque fluctuation is equal to the characteristic frequency of the weight balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the torque T is represented by the following equation. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>&equals;(7/5)&middot;<highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>&middot;(&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&middot;(<highlight><italic>R&plus;r</italic></highlight>)&middot;<highlight><italic>R&middot;&phgr;</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> If the weights are formed in a shape other than spherical shapes, the settings are preferably made by taking the inertial mass of the weight into consideration so that the resonance is effectively suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is used for the compressor C, which has the single headed pistons <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. However, the pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be used for a compressor that has double-headed pistons. In this type of compressor, cylinder bores are formed on either side of a crank chamber and each piston compresses gas in the corresponding pair of the cylinder bores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the cam plate (the swash plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) rotates integrally with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. However, the present invention may be applied to a compressor in which a cam plate rotates relative to a drive shaft. For example, the present invention may be applied to a wobble type compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be applied to a fixed displacement type compressor, in which the stroke of the pistons are not variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the present invention is applied to a reciprocal piston type compressor. However, the present invention may be applied to rotary compressors such as a scroll type compressor </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be applied to any type or rotor other than pulley. For example, the present invention may be applied to a sprocket or a gear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be applied to a rotating member located in the housing of the compressor C. For example, the lug plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which is located in the housing and coupled to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, may have the weights to suppress the rotational vibrations produced in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this case, resonance in the compressor C is suppressed and noise produced by collision between the weights and the weight guides is reduced. Moreover, since the weights are located in the compressor C, little noise escapes the compressor C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the present invention is applied to the compressor C. However, the present invention may be applied to other apparatuses. Specifically, the present invention may be applied to any apparatus in which rotational vibration is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The axis of the pendulum motion of each weight need not be parallel to the rotation axis of the rotor. Specifically, the axis of the pendulum motion may be inclined relative to the rotation axis of the rotor in a range in which the maximum torque fluctuation is suppressed by a desirable degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the present examples and embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalence of the appended claims. </paragraph>
