<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of adjusting the transmission time of data in a CDMA communication system. A UE (User Equipment) measures the time difference between the received time of a downlink DPCH (Dedicated Physical Channel) and the transmitted time of an uplink DPCH and reports it to an RNC (Radio Network Controller). The RNC transmits transmission time adjustment information to a node B and the UE if the time difference is out of a predetermined range. The node B then adjusts the transmission time of the downlink DPCH according to the transmission time adjustment information and transmits the downlink DPCH at the adjusted time. The UE receives the downlink DPCH by adjusting a search time for the downlink DPCH according to the transmission time adjustment information. </paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a method of transmitting DPCH (Dedicated Physical Channel) frames between an RNC (Radio Network Controller) and a UE (User Equipment) in a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) communication system, and in particular, to an ATTA (Adaptive Transmission Time Adjustment) method for adaptively adjusting transmission time between an RNC and a UE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, an RNC adjusts transmission time for data communication with a UE via a node B in a CDMA communication system. For the transmission time adjustment, the UE transmits an uplink DPCH frame To chips (<highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> chips) after receiving a downlink DPCCH (Dedicated Physical Control Channel)/DPDCH (Dedicated Physical Data Channel). The DPCCH and the DPDCH are collectively called the DPCH. In real implementation, however, a propagation time delay is involved according to the distance between the node B and the UE. In this case, a serving RNC (SRNC) requests the UE to report the time difference between the received time of the downlink DPCH (DL DPCH) frame and the transmitted time of the uplink DPCH (UL DPCH) frame (hereinafter, referred to as UE Rx-Tx time difference). The SRNC adjusts a DPCH frame offset IE (Information Element) in an RRC (Radio Resource Control) Reconfiguration message based on the UE Rx-Tx time difference in order to inform the UE about the transmission time adjustment. The SRNC only transmits the transmission time adjustment information to the UE but cannot adjust the transmission time of the UE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Specifically, an RNSAP (Radio Network Subsystem Application Part)/NBAP (Node B Application Part) message has no IE related with downlink transmission time adjustment and thus does not support the downlink DPCH transmission time adjustment of the SRNC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The UE usually transmits an uplink DPCH frame To chips after receiving a downlink DPCH frame. Here, an initial adjustment error must be limited within&plusmn;1.5 chips. The UE then adjusts its transmission time within a &frac14; chip duration every time period of 200 ms from the downlink DPCH frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When the UE enters a handover region, it receives downlink DPCH data from a plurality of cells. Since each DPCH data has a different propagation delay, the UE cannot adjust its uplink DPCH transmission time. The UE performs a tracking process while implementing a handover from a source node B to a target node B. Also in the case, the UE receives signals with different propagation delays from the source node B and the target node B and thus cannot adjust its transmission time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When the UE moves out of the handover region, the variance a of the time difference between the received time of the downlink DPCH frame and the transmitted time of the uplink DPCH frame may exceed an allowable value of 128 chips. Therefore the UE cannot adjust its transmission time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a time relationship between downlink DPCH data and uplink DPCH data in a handover region on the assumption that the UE moves from cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to cell <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The UE adjusts its transmission time according to the transmission time of cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, at every predetermined time during handover, and then according to the transmission time of cell <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, after the handover is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the first method, the UE transmits an uplink DPCH <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> time T<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>after receiving a downlink DPCH <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the second method, that is, when the UE enters the handover region, it receives downlink DPCHs <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> with different propagation delays from cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and cell <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, the UE transmits uplink DPCHs <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in every predetermined time period without adjusting its transmission time. Then, when the UE moves out of the handover region and enters the coverage area of cell <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the time difference of the received time of a downlink DPCH <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the transmitted time of an uplink DPCH <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> becomes T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&agr;. The UE performs a tracking process within a &frac14; chip duration in the unit of 200 ms and thus the UE cannot adjust the transmission time of the uplink DPCH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As described above, the conventional CDMA communication system has no path in which a control signal for robust transmission time adjustment between a downlink DPCH and an uplink DPCH is transmitted. Therefore, when the UE enters a handover region, it cannot adjust the transmission time of the uplink DPCH. Moreover, the tracking on the basis of the &frac14; chip duration is insufficient to ensure the DPCH transmission time adjustment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method of transmitting a control signal for adaptive transmission time adjustment of downlink and uplink DPCHs between an RNC and a UE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of adjusting the transmission time of downlink and uplink DPCHs using control signals for adaptive transmission time adjustment between an RNC and a UE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of maintaining the time difference between the transmitted time of a downlink DPDCH from a node B and the transmitted time of an uplink DPDCH from a UE to be a predetermined value by changing the transmission time of the downlink or uplink DPDCH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide an ATTA method between a plurality of nodes B and a UE in a handover region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above and other objects, there is provided a method of adjusting the transmission time of data in a CDMA communication system. A UE measures the time difference between the received time of a downlink DPCH and the transmitted time of an uplink DPCH and reports it to an RNC. The RNC transmits transmission time adjustment information to a node B and the UE if the time difference is out of a predetermined range. The node B then adjusts the transmission time of the downlink DPCH according to the transmission time adjustment information and transmits the downlink DPCH at the adjusted time. The UE receives the downlink DPCH by adjusting a search time for the downlink DPCH according to the transmission time adjustment information. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides control signals for downlink DPCH-uplink DPCH transmission time adjustment between a UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) and a UE. Especially, the present invention enables transmission time adjustment in such a non-time adjustment situation as a handover region illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, an RNC in the UTRAN requests the UE to measure the UE Rx-Tx time difference and report it. Based on the UE Rx-Tx time difference, the RNC decides whether to transmit the downlink DPCH or the uplink DPCH later than the previous time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, upon request from the RNC, the UE measures the UE Rx-Tx time difference (&agr;), which is defined as the time difference between the received time of the downlink DPCH and the transmitted time of the uplink DPCH, and reports it to the RNC in step <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the RNC compares the UE Rx-Tx time difference &agr; with an allowed time difference T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;. If Rx-Tx time difference(&agr;) is equal to or greater than T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;, the RNC determines whether &agr;&plus;SU&times;UCF is less than another allowed time difference &Dgr; in step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. If the condition of step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is satisfied, the RNC determines to delay the downlink DPCH frame, and if the condition of step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is satisfied, the RNC determines to delay the uplink DPCH frame. In the former case, the RNC sets an NCF (Node B Control Factor) that makes &agr; equal to or less than A after time alignment in step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In the latter case, the RNC sets a UCF (UE Control Factor) that makes &agr; equal to or less than &Dgr; after time alignment in step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> How the NCF and the UCF are determined will be described in more detail. Upon receipt of the UE Rx-Tx time difference from the UE, the RNC determines how long the downlink DPCH or uplink DPCH is to be delayed. That is, the RNC compares T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&agr; with T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;. Here, &Dgr; is a threshold by which it is determines whether the node B and the UE is to adjust their transmission time. While &Dgr; is variable, it is usually 128 chips, or 147 chips with an empirical stabilizing value added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> If T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&agr; is greater than T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;, the RNC decides to change the transmission time of the downlink DPCH from the node B. Then, in order to reset T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&agr; to be T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, the RNC delays the transmission time of the node B by a multiple of 256 chips. This time delay value is the NCF. On the other hand, if T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&agr; is less than T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;, the RNC decides to delay the transmission time of the UE. The time delay may be set on a chip basis or on the basis of a multiple of 256chips. This decision is implementation-dependent. The uplink time delay value is the UCF. Finally, if T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&agr; is equal to T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;, the RNC maintains the transmission time of the downlink and uplink DPCHs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With regard to determination of delayed transmission of the downlink DPCH, the RNC determines whether the UE Rx-Tx time difference satisfies the condition expressed as </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&agr;&lt;256&times;NCF&plus;&Dgr;&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If Eq. (1) is satisfied, the RNC sets the NCF and transmits it to the node B by a Radio Link Reconfiguration Prepare message and to the UE by a Physical Channel Reconfiguration message. The NCF may be set to 1, 2 or 3 and as stated before, &Dgr; is 128 chips, or 147 chips with an empirical stabilizing value added. The RNC sets a two-bit NCF to an appropriate value indicating the multiple of 256 chips in a reserved area, or additionally uses one bit to indicate the UCF or NCF in the Radio Link Reconfiguration Prepare message. The Physical Channel Reconfiguration message can be constructed in the same manner as the Radio Link Reconfiguration Prepare message. However, if the UCF is set on a chip basis, the number of chips to be shifted must be indicated in the messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a time relationship between the downlink and uplink DPCHs on a CFN/SFN axis in the UE. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the time difference between the starting received time <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> of the downlink DPCH and the starting transmitted time <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of the uplink DPCH is T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plus;&agr;. T<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is statically determined, 1024 chips and &agr; is an accumulation of propagation delay for a predetermined time due to the movement of the UE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating a robust transmission time adjustment method in the CDMA communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. Generation and transmission of the NCF will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, upon request from the RNC, the UE measures the UE Rx-Tx time difference using the received time of the downlink DPCH and the transmitted time of the uplink DPCH and reports it to the RNC via the node B in step <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>.
