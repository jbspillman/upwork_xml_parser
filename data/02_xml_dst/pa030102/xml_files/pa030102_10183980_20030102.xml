<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of a manufacturing method of semiconductor device of this invention and a semiconductor device made by the method will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The embodiment involves a driver for display device having various kinds of MOS transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The display device described above includes various kinds of flat panel display devices such as LCD display device, LED display device, organic EL (electroluminescence) display device, inorganic EL display device, PDP (plasma display device) and FED (field emission display device), among other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As an example, a driver having an anode driver and a cathode driver for driving an organic EL display device will be described. The driver makes an organic EL element emit light by supplying a constant electric current to the organic EL element. Since the EL element is a self-luminous element, it does not require a backlight, which is usually needed for a liquid crystal display device. Also, the EL element does not have a limit of viewing angle. With these advantages, the EL display device is expected to replace the LCD device in near future. Especially, the organic EL element provides a display with a high brightness. The organic EL element is also superior to the inorganic EL in efficiency, responsiveness and multiple color display capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> shows a driver for driving the EL display device described above. The figure shows, from the left side, an N-channel MOS transistor and a P-channel MOS transistor of a logic system (for example, 3V), an N-channel MOS transistor for a level shifter (for example, 30V), and an N-channel transistor of high breakdown strength (for example, 30V). In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, the driver includes, from the left side, an N-channel MOS transistor of high breakdown strength with lowered on-resistance (for, example, 30V), a P-channel MOS transistor of high breakdown strength, and a P-channel MOS transistor of high breakdown strength with lowered on-resistance (for example, 30V). In order to differentiate the MOS transistor of high breakdown strength described above from the MOS transistor of high breakdown strength with lowered on-resistance, the MOS transistor of high breakdown strength with lowered on-resistance will be referred to as a SLED (slit channel by counter doping with extended shallow drain) MOS transistor, hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor of this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>, an N-type well <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> includes a P-channel MOS transistor of high breakdown strength and a P-channel SLEDMOS transistor of high breakdown strength with lowered on-resistance. The N-type well <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> forms an upper portion of the device. A P-type well <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes other various MOS transistors and forms a lower portion of the device. In other words, the N-channel MOS transistor and the P-channel transistor of the fine logic system (for example, 3V) are placed on the lower portion of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The device intermediate described above is manufactured according to a manufacturing method, which includes processing steps described below. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the P-type well (PW) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the N-type well (NW) <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are formed inside a P-type semiconductor substrate (P-sub) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by using LOCOS method in order to determine the area for forming various kinds of MOS transistors. That is, a pad oxide film and a silicon nitride film are placed on the N-type well region of the substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Then, an ion implantation layer is formed by implanting boron ions with an 80 KeV acceleration voltage and an implantation condition of 8&times;10<highlight><superscript>12</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, after masking the pad oxide film and the silicon nitride film. Then, the surface of the substrate is field oxidized through LOCOS method with the silicon nitride film as a mask to form a LOCOS film. During this process, the boron ions, which have been implanted under the area for forming the LOCOS film, are diffused into the substrate, making a P-type layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Next, phosphorus ions are implanted with an 80 KeV acceleration voltage and an implantation condition of 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>12</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>on the surface of the substrate with the LOCOS film as a mask to form an ion implantation layer, after removing the pad oxide film and the silicon nitride film. The impurity ions implanted into the substrate are then thermally diff-used, after removing the LOCOS film. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the P-type well <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> placed in the substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is located at the lower portion of the device and the N-type well <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is located at the upper portion of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, an element separation film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of 500 nm is formed by the LOCOS method for separating the elements for each of the MOS transistors. On the active area excluding the element separation film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a thick oxide film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of high breakdown strength of about 80 nm is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Then, the first N-type and P-type source and drain layers of low impurity concentration (referred to as an LN layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and an LP layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> hereinafter) are formed by using a photoresist film as a mask. That is, the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the LN layer is first covered with the photoresist film (not shown in the figure). Then, phosphorus ions are implanted with an acceleration voltage of 120 KeV and with an implantation condition of 8&times;10<highlight><superscript>12</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to form the LN layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Next, the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the LP layer is covered with the photoresist (PR) film, and then boron ions are implanted with an acceleration voltage of 120 KeV and with an implantation condition of 8.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>12</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to form the LP layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The implanted ions described above are thermally diffused forming the LN layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the LP layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> during an anneal processing (for example, in N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere at 1100<highlight><subscript>&yuml;</subscript></highlight> for 2 hours). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, second N-type and P-type source and drain layers (referred to as an SLN layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and an SLP layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> hereinafter) of low impurity concentration are formed at the area between LN layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the area between the LP layers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, respectively, which have been formed at the areas for the P-channel and the N-channel SLEDMOS transistors, by using a photoresist film as a mask. That is, the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the SLN layer is first covered with the photoresist film (not shown in the figure). Then, phosphorus ions are implanted with an acceleration voltage of 120 KeV and with an implantation condition of 1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>12</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to form the SLN layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> adjacent to the LN layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Next, the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the SLP layer is covered with the photoresist (PR) film, and then boron difluoride ions (<highlight><superscript>49</superscript></highlight>BF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) are implanted with an acceleration voltage of 140 KeV and with an implantation condition of 2.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>12</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to form the SLP layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> adjacent to the LP layers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The impurity concentrations are determined to be about the same between the LN layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and SLN layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and between the LP layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the SLP layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. It is also possible to have different impurity concentrations among the corresponding layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, N-type and P-type source and drain layers of high impurity concentration (referred to as an N&plus; layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a P&plus; layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> hereinafter) are formed by using a photoresist film as a mask. That is, the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the N&plus; layer is first covered with the photoresist film (not shown in the figure). Then, phosphorus ions are implanted with an acceleration voltage of 80 KeV and with an implantation condition of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to form the N&plus; layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Next, the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the P&plus; layer is covered with the photoresist (PR) film, and then boron difluoride ions are implanted with an acceleration voltage of 140 KeV and with an implantation condition of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to form the P&plus; layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

That is, the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the P-type layer is covered with a photoresist film (not shown in the figure).

The order of the processes for the ion implantation processes shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B is may be alternated. Channels are formed on the surface of the P-type body layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the N-type body layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, inside the area for the N-channel and P-channel MOS transistors of fine patterning and of ordinary breakdown strength on the substrate, a second P-type well (SPW) <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a second N-type well (SNW) <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> That is, boron ions, for example, are implanted with a 190 KeV acceleration voltage and with a first implantation condition of 1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>inside the P-type well <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> using a photoresist film as a mask, which has an opening in the area for the N-channel MOS of ordinary breakdown strength.

If a high acceleration voltage generator capable of generating 380 KeV can not be provided, it is also possible to employ a double charge method, where divalent phosphorus ions are implanted with a 190 KeV acceleration voltage and with an implantation condition of 1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Then, the gate oxide film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is removed from the areas for the N-channel and the P-channel MOS transistors of ordinary breakdown strength and from the area for the N-channel MOS transistor for the level shifter. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, a new gate oxide film with a preferable thickness is formed on the areas, from which the gate oxide film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has been removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> That is, a gate oxide film <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 14 nm (it is only about 7 nm at this step, but the thickness of the film will increase upon the formation of the gate oxide film of ordinary breakdown strength, as described later) is formed on the surface by thermal oxidation to be used for the N-channel MOS transistors of the level shifter. The gate oxide film <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for the N-channel MOS transistor of the level shifter formed on the areas for the N-channel and the P-channel MOS transistors of ordinary breakdown strength is, then, removed. The thin gate oxide film <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> (about 7 nm) of ordinary breakdown strength is formed on the areas, from which the gate oxide film has been removed, by thermal oxidation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, polysilicon film having a thickness of 100 nm is formed on the entire surface. POCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is thermally difflused into the polysilicon film to make the film conductive. Tungsten silicide film having a thickness of 100 nm and then, SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film having a thickness of 150 nm are formed on the polysilicon film. Through the patterning with photoresist, gate electrodes <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>D, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>E, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>F, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>G for MOS transistors are formed. The SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film works as a hard mask during the patterning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, source and drain layers of low impurity concentration are formed for the N-channel and the P-channel MOS transistors of ordinary breakdown strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> That is, by using a photoresist film (not shown in the figure) as a mask, which covers the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the source and the drain layers of low impurity concentration for the N-channel MOS transistor of ordinary breakdown strength, phosphorus ions, for example, are implanted with an acceleration voltage of 20 KeV and with an implantation condition of 6.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to form N-type source and drain layers <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of low impurity concentration. Next, by using the photoresist film (PR) as a mask, which covers the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the source and drain layers of low impurity concentration for the P-channel MOS transistor of ordinary breakdown strength, boron difluoride ions, for example, are implanted with an acceleration voltage of 20 KeV and with an implantation condition of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to form P-type source and drain layers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of low impurity concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>, a TEOS film <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 250 nm is formed using LPCV method to cover the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>D, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>E, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>F, and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>G. By using a photoresist film (PR) as a mask, which has openings in the areas for the N-channel and the P-channel MOS transistors of ordinary breakdown strength, the anisotropic etching is performed on the TEOS film. This creates side wall spacer films <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>A at the both sides of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B. The TESO film <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> remains at the area covered by the photoresist (PR) film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The source and drain layers for the N-channel and the P-channel MOS transistors of high impurity concentration are formed by using the gate electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A and the side wall spacer film <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>A as well as the gate electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>B and the side wall spacer film <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>A as masks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> That is, by using a photoresist film (not shown in the figure) as a mask, which covers the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the source and drain of high impurity concentration for the N-channel MOS transistor of ordinary breakdown strength, arsenic ions, for example, are implanted with an acceleration voltage of 100 KeV and with an implantation condition of 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to form N&plus; type source and drain layers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of high impurity concentration. Next, by using the photoresist film (not shown in the figure) as a mask, which covers the surface area of the substrate excluding the area for the source and drain layers of high impurity concentration for the P-channel MOS transistor of ordinary breakdown strength, boron difluoride ions, for example, are implanted with an acceleration voltage of 40 KeV and with an implantation condition of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to form a P&plus; type source and drain layers <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of high impurity concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> After forming an interlayer insulating film having a thickness of about 600 nm made of a TEOS film or the BPSG film on the entire surface, a metal wiring layer making contact with the source and drain layers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of high impurity concentration is formed, which completes the formation of the N-channel and the P-channel MOS transistors of ordinary breakdown strength, the N-channel MOS transistor for the level shifter, the N-channel and the P-channel MOS transistors of high breakdown strength, and the N-channel SLEDMOS and the P-channel SLEDMOS transistors of high breakdown strength with lowered on-resistance. All these transistors are included in the driver for the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> One of characteristics of this embodiment, in which an upper wiring layer makes contact with a lower wiring layer through via holes made in an interlayer insulating film covering the lower wiring layer, is that the surface of a bump electrode is flattened by not placing the via holes under the bump electrode. Rather, the via holes are formed in the interlayer insulating film away from the bump electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Also, by placing a portion of the lower wiring layer underneath the bump electrode, the flatness around a pad portion, in which the bump electrode is formed, is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Next, processing steps of forming the bump electrode structure with related wiring, which is described above, is described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As an example, formation of a bump electrode of the N-channel SLEDMOS transistor is described, but the same method is applicable to other transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> first wiring layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is formed on an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A and is connected to the source layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the N-channel SLEDMOS transistor through a first contact hole <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> made in the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A. Similar contact hole structure is formed on the drain layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, but omitted from the drawing for clear and simple presentation of the structure in the drawing. Then, a second wiring layer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is formed on the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>B and is connected to the first wiring layer through a via hole <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> made in the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>B. A third wiring layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed on the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>C and is connected to the second wiring layer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> through via holes <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> made in an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is formed to cover the third wiring layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Then, a pad portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is formed by making a plurality of openings in an area of the passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, on which a bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is formed. The pad portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is about 30-80 &mgr;m in its size, and includes a portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A of the passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which remains intact after the formation of the openings. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the pad portion is formed away from the via holes <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A conductive material <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> fills the openings in the passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, corresponding to a bump electrode structure, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, tungsten is used as the conductive material. A tungsten film is, first, formed over the passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, including the openings, and, then, is etched back to the top surface of the passivation film to leave the conductive material only in the openings. Accordingly, the pad portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has a flat surface consisting of the filled-in conductive material and the remaining passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>. However, this embodiment is not limited this processing method. For example, CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) method may be used to remove the conductive material formed over the passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> This configuration reduces dent formation on the top surface of the bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> because the conductive material fills the openings, and, thus, provides a flat base on which the bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is formed. The lower portion of the bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> no longer has to sink into the openings to make contact with the third wiring layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. It is also noted that the remaining portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A of the passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> also provides support for the bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> together with the filled-in openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Then, a barrier metal film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> made of titanium nitride (TiN) film having a thickness of about 200 nm is formed on the passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> including the openings filled with the conductive material. However, the material for the barrier metal film is not limited to titanium nitride film. Titanium tungsten (TiW) film, titanium film, and the combination of these films can also be used for the same purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Then a gold bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 15 &mgr;m is formed on the barrier metal film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by electroplating, and the barrier metal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on the passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is removed by using a photoresist film (not shown in the figure) covering the gold bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> as a mask. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference> show only the upper portion of the device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, which shows the final step of this embodiment, is a cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> cut along line B-B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Therefore, unlike the conventional bump electrode structure (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>), the middle portion of the gold bump electrode is not lower than its peripheral portion because the bump electrode is supported by the flat surface of the remaining passivation film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the filled-in openings. Thus, the yield of the mounting process including TAB is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, since the third wiring layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> works as a power source line, it is designed to be wide. When the contact is made with the wide wiring layer, such as the third wiring layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to make a broad contact hole in order to lower the contact resistance. However, when various kinds of transistors are integrated through the patterning processes as fine as 0.35 &mgr;m, this minimum size is applied to each of the via holes. Thus, there should be a plurality of via holes with a minimum diameter defined by the resolution of the patterning process. In this case, if there is a plurality of fine via holes under the gold bump electrode, as in the case of the conventional structure (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>), dents will be created on the top surface of the bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, reflecting the uneven top surface of the third wiring layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> at the via holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the via holes <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are not formed under the gold bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in this embodiment. Instead, the via holes <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are formed in the area away from the gold bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Thus, unlike the conventional structure, the dents will not be formed on the top surface of the bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Additionally, by placing a portion of a lower wiring layer (the second wiring layer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> or the combination of the second wiring layer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the first wiring layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>) under bump electrode, which does not make contact with the upper wiring layer (the third wiring layer), the flatness around the bump electrode may be maintained, because unevenness cased by the absence of the lower wiring layer under the bump electrode is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the via holes <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are not formed underneath the bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Instead the via holes <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are formed in the area away from the gold bump electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, this embodiment achieves a flat top surface of the bump electrode by placing the bump electrode on a flat surface consisting of the filled-in openings and the remaining passivation film. However, this invention is not limited to this configuration. This invention is also applicable to the configuration, which has via holes underneath bump electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The above is a detailed description of a particular embodiment of the invention which is not intended to limit the invention to the embodiment described. It is recognized that modifications within the scope of the invention will occur to a person skilled in the art. Such modifications and equivalents of the invention are intended for inclusion within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
