<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to image processing apparatus and method for generating new images using static images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A number of high-quality, large-screen displays are developed recently and used for applications, such as indoor and outdoor advertisements, etc. based on images, both dynamic and static. These displays, when installed at locations where many people gather, contribute to increasing the impact of advertising, etc. through display of various images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Dynamic images for advertisement, etc., with their better eye-catching effect, would require no further editing to give viewers a certain degree of impact of advertising, etc. In contrast, static images alone are less attractive and thus would need to use some technique in order to improve eye-catching effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one technique, a static image is combined with a separately prepared dynamic image. However, a dynamic image which is out of context with a static image would fail to call the viewers&apos; attention to the static image. In addition, it is extremely difficult to create a dynamic image which is not boring and which matches with a static image. In other techniques, some ad phrases may be scrolled, for example. This wouldn&apos;t, however, be able to eye-catching effect. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention has been made in view of the above circumstances, and an object of the invention is, therefore, to provide an image processing apparatus and method, etc. capable of creating images which can arouse viewers&apos; interest in static images and thus are highly eye-catching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An image processing apparatus according to the invention is provided with: an extracting device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for sequentially extracting regions from a static image, as first images; an image forming device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for forming a second image in which each of the first images is repeated in an array; and an image outputting device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for outputting the static image and the second image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, the static image and the second image, in which each of the first images sequentially extracted from the static image is repeated in an array, are output, hence arousing interest in the static image to provide a highly eye-catching image as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The image processing apparatus may also be provided with an image displaying device (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) for displaying images output from the image outputting ;device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). In this case, the image display device (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) displays thereon the static image and the second image in which each of the first images is repeated in an array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The image outputting device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) may also output both the static image and the second image simultaneously. In this case, the static image and the second image may be output to be displayed side by side, or to display the second image in a manner surrounding the static image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The image outputting device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) may also output the images by switching between the static image and the second image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The image processing apparatus may also be provided with an extracting method specifying device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for specifying an extracting method used by the extracting device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). In this case, the extracting method may be specified according to a command accepted by command accepting device. In addition, it may also be arranged such that one can specify, for example, the size, shape, moving speed, etc. of each of the first images sequentially extracted from the static image using the extracting method specifying device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The image processing apparatus may also be provided with an image forming method specifying device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for specifying a method by which the image forming device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) forms the second image. In this case, an image forming method may be specified according to a command accepted by the command accepting device.

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The image processing apparatus may also be provided with an output method specifying device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for specifying a method by which the image outputting device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) outputs the static image and the second image. In this case, it may be arranged such that one can specify a time period for displaying the images to be sequentially switched. The images to be sequentially switched include only the static image, only the second image, or appropriate combinations of the static image with the second image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The image processing apparatus may also be provided with: a static image storage device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for storing a plurality of static images; and a static image selecting device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for selecting the static images for extraction by the extracting device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), one at a time, from the plurality of static images stored in the static image storage device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). In this case, the image corresponding to the selected static images includes only the static images, only the second images, and appropriate combinations of the static images with the second images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Each first image, or each region extracted from the static image by the extracting device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), may also move continuously. In this case, the second image in which each first image is repeated in an array also changes continuously, hence resulting in a substantially dynamic image that is sufficiently eye-catching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The image processing apparatus may also be provided with an extracting region displaying device (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for displaying the extracting regions. In this case, one can become aware of how the second image is being formed, and this can make the image more interesting. In one technique for displaying each first image or each region extracted from the static image, a mark indicating the first image may be superimposed on the static image displayed on the image displaying device. For example, the mark may also be in the form of one or more lines surrounding the region to be extracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A method of processing an image of the invention is provided with the steps of: sequentially extracting regions from a static image, as first images; forming a second image in which each of the first images is repeated in an array; and outputting the static image and the second image formed by the image forming device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the configuration of an image processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention will be described. The image processing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is provided with a scanner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A for capturing a static image from printed matter such as posters and photographs, a electronic camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B for capturing a photographed image (static image) and the like, a computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for generating a predetermined image based on the captured static image, and an image display <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, connected to the computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for displaying the generated image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be a personal computer (PC) or any other hardware capable of similar logic operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Although a large-screen display is preferable for enhanced effects, the image display <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be various types of displays including but not limited to personal computer displays, television displays compatible with NTSC, PAL and HDTV video specifications, CRTs, plasma displays, liquid-crystal panels, and other large-screen displays using LEDs and electric bulbs. In addition, a software recording medium <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is not limited to a CD-shaped medium shown in the figure, but may be of any other forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be connected to the image display <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a desired way, depending on the type of signal to be transmitted. For video signals, RGB cables may be used, and for digital video signals (digitally coded signals), other suitable cables may be used. These signals may also be transmitted wirelessly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring next to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a procedure performed by the image processing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be described in accordance with steps to be taken in order to display an image using a static image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the image to be displayed on the image display <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be described. In this embodiment, the processing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> displays an image shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for a prescribed time period, after which it displays an image shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> static image, which is an original image, is displayed in a left-side area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, on which a triangular mark <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> indicative of a sampling element is superimposed. The mark <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be any region or closed shape linearly defined in the area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, or may be displayed by changing the color, brightness, contrast, etc. of such a region or shape. Additionally, an element-repeated image, or otherwise referred to as a patterned image is displayed in a right-side area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The patterned image is made up of multiple unit images <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, each of which is the region indicated by the mark <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as the sampling element. While the mark <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> makes continuous movement over the area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the image in which the unit image <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or the region indicated by the mark <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is repeated is displayed in the area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on a real-time basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The patterned image in the area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed of a pattern which is prepared, for example, by combining six (6) unit images <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> together, each unit image being oriented in one direction and rotated by 60 degrees relative to an adjacent unit image. How the patterned image in the area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is generated will be described in detail below. As the mark <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> moves over the static image, i.e., as the sampling element moves over the static image, each unit image <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> changes to constantly change the patterned image in the area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. If the mark <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (i.e., the sampling element) moves at some moderate speed, one can see the patterned image changing continuously, thus making the static patterned image substantially dynamic so as to be more eye-catching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the whole patterned image displayed in the area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may continuously shift in one direction, resulting in a dynamic image in which the patterned image is shifting in one direction with each unit image <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> changing therein. It may be arranged such that the shifting of the whole patterned image can be cancelled, or such that the shifting speed and direction can be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As described above, although it is desirable to superimpose the mark <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the static image displayed on the image display <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, other ways may also be used to display a region or shape on the static image as a sampling element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The image of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is switched to the image of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> after displayed for the prescribed time period. The image of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which is the same as that in the area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, i</cross-reference>.e., the patterned image composed of an array of the repeated unit images <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, appears on the entire screen. Although the static image itself is not displayed in the image of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the sampling element continuously moves over the hidden static image similarly to the display of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring here to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the procedure for displaying an image will be described. In the procedure involving steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an original static image is selected and data for defining a display method is designated, as to the image to be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> First, in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, software is activated. Then, in step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> accepts a command from an operator via an input device such as a keyboard, mouse, or touch panel, to select a static image, which is an original of the image to be displayed. In this step, the static image is captured to the computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the scanner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, electronic camera <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B or the like, and then a desired static image is selected from one or more static images stored in a memory within the computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to a command from the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Next, in step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the shape and size of an element (sampling element) for sampling the static image selected in step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is designated according to a command from the operator. The orientation of the sampling element may also be designated. The shape of a sampling element is not limited to the triangle shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, but includes various shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an example of a screen through which sampling elements can be selected. On this screen, the operator can select any of twenty-one (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) elements through a row (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and column (a-c) designation. A selected element (an element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is highlighted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, any element containing one or more dots (.) generates a pattern through rotation, and thus each dot indicates how adjacent elements are related to each other when rotated. For example, an element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>forms an element-repeated image or a pattern such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Actually, a patterned image in which the hexagon shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is further repeated is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An element containing arrows (&uarr;) is repeated in a manner forming a mirror image with its adjacent elements. For example, an element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>repeats itself to form a pattern such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In this case also, a patterned image in which such a hexagon is further repeated is actually formed. This patterned image is identical with an image formed by a kaleidoscope using three mirrors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;composite element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&rdquo; or a &ldquo;pattern <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>,&rdquo; for example, is made up of two repeats (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) or four repeats (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of a &ldquo;basic&rdquo; element displayed as a mark <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Actually, such a composite element generates a patterned image in which the composite element or pattern is further repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> An element such as an element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>containing neither dots nor arrows generates a patterned image in which the element is repeated only in one direction. In some embodiments, one may be able to opt to designate rotation and mirror-image formation for these basic elements. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The shape of a sampling element may be input as a parameter that expresses the dimensions of its component line or lines and its orientation in terms of values. A sampling element corresponding to an input parameter may be displayed on a display (or the image display <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) connected to the computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that the real sampling element can be viewed on the screen for a check. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the direction and speed for moving the sampling element over the static image are designated according to a command from the operator. The moving direction may be designated by entering both x- and y-axis coordinates. The moving speed may be designated in terms of the amount of movement per second or in terms of both the amount of movement and the frequency of movement (or time intervals), for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the moving (shifting) direction and speed for the whole patterned image are designated according to a command from the operator.

If not, then control returns to step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to repeat steps S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In steps S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the image is presented according to the designated data. In step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, software is activated, and in step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the designated data is read. In step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the video image is displayed on the image display <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a presentation according to the data read in step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not a request is made to terminate the presentation, according to a command from the operator or based on information about how many times the presentation is to be given, for example. If the request is made, control proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to terminate the procedure. Otherwise, control returns to step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to continue the presentation according to the designated data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Any method may be used to combine static images together, patterned images generated based on the static images together, and a static image with a patterned image, and any display sequence may also be applied to the combined images. A static image and a patterned image may be displayed simultaneously as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, or a patterned image alone may be displayed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. A plurality of static images may be displayed in various sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Assuming that static images A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> . . . are prepared and that video images including their patterned images (each including only a patterned image, or both a patterned image and the static image) are B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> . . . , respectively, then they may be developed by switching in sequences such as (1) A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rarr;B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rarr;A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rarr;B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rarr;A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rarr;B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> . . . ,(2) A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rarr;A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rarr;A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> . . . , and (3) B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rarr;B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rarr;B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> . . . . The display sequence in which the image of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> succeeds the image of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> corresponds to that mentioned in (1) above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> According to the image processing system of the invention, an element-repeated or patterned image (dynamic image) is automatically generated on a real-time basis based on a static image. This prevents the user from separately preparing a dynamic image, and hence the amount of data prepared for displaying the image can be reduced. In addition, a patterned image is generated using an image extracted from a static image, and this permits the patterned image to get along well with the static image, and hence can arouse interest in the static image. Moreover, the patterned image looks very entertaining, and gives variegated changing patterns over the entire screen in linkage with changes in the position of a sampling element over the static image to add extremely high eye-catching effects to the generated image. Particularly, when a static image and a patterned image are displayed simultaneously and a sampling element extracted from the static image is also displayed on the screen as a mark, viewers can become aware of how the patterned image is being generated. This further increases the viewers&apos; interest in the displayed image. The feature of the invention is not only to attract viewers&apos; attention to a patterned image, but also to increase its eye-catching effects in relation to an original static image by effectively developing the static image. Therefore, the invention is particularly advantageous when applied to presentations in which one wishes to attract viewers&apos; attention to a static image. </paragraph>
