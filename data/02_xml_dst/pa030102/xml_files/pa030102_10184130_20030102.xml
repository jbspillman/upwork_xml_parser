<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">At least one printer is connected to an image source such as a digital camera via a network. When the printer receives a notification from the image source to switch a first image displayed on a display device to a second image, the printer displays an identifier of the second image according to the notification, and lights up an LED on a print button provided on the printer. When a period in which the printer is permitted to print the displayed image reaches a set time before a timeout, the LED on the print button is flashed. When the timeout is reached, the LED is turned off. When the print button is depressed, the printer sends a request for an image to the image source, receives image data for the image sent from the image source, and prints the image. When the print button is depressed to confirm a decision to print a displayed image while the printer is printing another image, the print decision is stored in a storage device in the printer, and the printer retrieves and executes the stored print decision after the ongoing printing operation is completed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an image printing apparatus that is connected to a network, and more particularly to an image printing apparatus that is capable of printing images displayed on an image display device that is connected to a common network that is connected to the printing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A combination of a digital camera and a color printer can create prints with the print quality that is comparable to the print quality of photographs created by a conventional silver-salt camera. Group photos, which are conventionally photographed and printed through the use of a silver-salt camera, can be provided with good quality by a digital camera and a printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Also, presentations, which are conventionally performed with the use of an overhead projector (OHP) and slides, can be performed with the use of a notebook type personal computer and a video projector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, when group photos are created by an ordinary digital camera and printed by a printer, some shortcomings are experienced. For example, multiple prints may need to be created for the number of people who are photographed and shown in the photos, or prints may need to be created for the number of people who want a particular photo, after checking the number of such people. This is nothing more than making copies of photos that are taken by a conventional silver-salt camera, which can be wasteful and time-consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when generating documents to be distributed in a presentation that is carried out using a combination of an ordinary computer and a projector, multiple sets of the documents may need to be created in advance for the number of expected participants to the presentation, or only a predetermined number of such documents need to be prepared upon confirming the number of participants or destinations at which the documents are to be sent. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to an improvement of the operability in printing images. The present invention relates to a system, apparatus and method, which notifies to the user in a user-friendly manner as to whether the user can request images to be printed. The present invention also relates to a system, apparatus and method, which is capable of printing an image that is displayed on a display device even after the image is switched to another image during printing. </paragraph>

The network can be a wired network such as, for example, Ethernet, IEEE1394 or the like, or a wireless network such as, for example, IEEE802.11b, Bluetooth or the like. In the first embodiment of the present invention, Bluetooth, one type of wireless network, is used as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Bluetooth provides a wireless transmission system that operates in the unlicensed band at 2.4 GHz, and is jointly developed by member companies that contribute to Bluetooth SIG, a business association. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The published Bluetooth specification (version 1) provides functions to structure piconet that forms a network connecting maximum eight devices (seven devices when communicating simultaneously with one another), and a scatternet that forms a larger scale network connecting a plurality of piconets. One of the devices in the piconet functions as a master and all the remaining devices function as slaves. Also, the Bluetooth specification provides functions to authorize accesses to devices within the piconet by personal identification numbers (PIN), and to allow selection and connection of Bluetooth devices that are present within an area where communications can be established. In addition, the Bluetooth specification includes device profiles that are strictly regulated to realize mutual connections of devices, and systems of service discoveries for autonomously structuring networks among devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a connection structure including a digital camera (an image display device) and at least one printer (image printing apparatus) connected by a Bluetooth network. A plurality of printers may be connected by the network, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The printers may be any printers including portable printers and color portable printers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, reference numerals <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>denote portable color printers, reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> denotes a digital camera, reference numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> denotes a display device such as a large-size TV, a projector or the like connected to the digital camera <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through a video cable. This setting allows many people to view images retained in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the same time. Each of the printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has a structure that is generally the same as that of the image printing apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are connected to the digital camera through the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In this system, the printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> form a piconet. The digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> functions as a master in the piconet, and the printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>which are slaves, can independently communicate with the master, i.e., the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A method of image printing that is performed on the system in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> First, when the user handling the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> sets the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a replay mode and turns on the power, a first image is displayed on the display device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, an identifier (file name, image number, image handler, etc.) of the displayed image and timeout information (seconds to accept the image) are sent to all of the printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>within the piconet. Also, when the user operates an operation button <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to switch the image to another image to be displayed, an identifier of the new image and timeout information are sent to all of the printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> At this moment, the display device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> displays the image, the identifier of the image, and remaining seconds for accepting the image for printing while counting down the remaining seconds. The remaining seconds may eventually reach a timeout, which allows the user at the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to know an appropriate timing when he can switch displayed images. Images can be switched anytime after the timeout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, which receive the identifier of the image and timeout information from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, display the identification information of the image on their respective display devices <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, for example, in an upper line in each display device, and turn on LEDs that are assembled in print buttons <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> provided on the respective printers. At the same time, each of the printers starts a countdown with the timeout information received being set as an initial value. For example, as the countdown reaches 5 seconds before the timeout, the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be blinked, and when the countdown reaches the timeout, the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be turned off. The display device <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be included in the user interface module <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Operations on the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on each of the printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may be validated from the start of countdown to the timeout (while the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is continuously lit or is blinking), and invalidated in other cases (when the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> turns off). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment example, a cancel button may be equipped with the user interface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such that the user can sends his intention not to print (i.e., a no-print response) to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> before the timeout is reached, which improves the printing efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> If the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on any of the printers is depressed, that printer sends a print response to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and if the timeout is reached, the printer sends a no-print response to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, when the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives print-responses or no-print responses from all of the printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, or the timeout is reached (for example, there may be a printer that has an abnormal printing condition), the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> determines that the image on display can be switched to another image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, before depressing the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, other buttons (e.g., ten-keys, up/down key, etc.) may be operated to designate the number of copies of the image on display. Each of the printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may display the number of prints on the display apparatus <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (for example, in a lower line thereof), and make prints in the number displayed at the time when the print button is depressed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a situation where the printers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>start printing, and the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>does not start printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> At this moment, in the present embodiment example, the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shifts to and stays in a power-saving mode until the display of the image is switched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment example, even when any of the printers in the piconet is printing, the printer that is printing can immediately present to the user information that may be sent from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> each time a displayed image is switched to another image, and can return responses to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, if such information are to be printed, the printer successively stores the information in the RAM <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within the printer. After completing the on-going printing, printing of an image associated with the stored information can be started even after the display of that image has been completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> show flowcharts of process steps performed by the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is an image printing apparatus in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> indicate part of steps in a program for the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the printer. The CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the printer may be a microcomputer that runs the program read from the ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a storage medium that stores the program in a manner that the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can read out. In another configuration, the program may be stored in a floppy disk or a CD-ROM, and the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may read the program using a floppy disk driver or a CD-ROM driver (not shown in the drawing) and run the program. In this configuration, the floppy disk or the CD-ROM corresponds to a storage medium that stores the program in a manner that the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can read out. Also, the program may be supplied to the CPU from outside through the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Operations performed by the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the power is turned on, and the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed in a state that can communicate with the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> checks in step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as to whether or not an image display switching notification from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been present in the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. If the image display switching notification has arrived, the printer renews the display content displayed on the display device <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and waits an instruction from the user while turning on the LED in the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, identification information (file name, image number, etc.) of an image to be displayed after the previous image is switched is displayed on the display device <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In other words, upon receiving an image display switching notification from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the LED in the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> turns on to let the user know that the image can be printed by operating the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> At the same time when the image display switching notification is received, timeout information included in the image display switching notification is set to an initial value, and a countdown of the response timer is started. In step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to if the timeout is reached, and in step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether a print execution instruction is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> If the timeout is reached in step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, it is determined that the notified image is not to be printed, and a no-print response is returned through the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, the LED within the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is turned off. The timeout indicates that a period in which the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can instruct a printing operation is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If a print execution is instructed through the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a print response is returned through the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and image information (identification information for the image) included in the image display switching notification is added to the last of a print list stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When no instruction of a print execution is found in step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a period of time until the timeout is reached is checked, and a determination is made as to whether or not an image display switching should be notified in step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. If the period of time until the timeout is reached is shorter than a pre-set period of time, this is notified to the user by, for example, blinking the LED within the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When a series of processing steps which starts in step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is completed, a determination is made again in step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as to whether the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is currently printing. If it is printing, a printing process in a single unit is conducted in step <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The printing process in a single unit may be defined as a finely divided process such as a process for one line of the image at a time. For example, in this embodiment example, when an image display switching notification from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is detected through polling, the printing process is divided and progressed bit by bit so that the response will not be extremely delayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As the printing process is progressed, a determination is made in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as to whether or not the latest image display switching notification from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is responded. If a print response or a no-print response has been made, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and the next image display switching notification is checked. On the other hand, neither a print response or a no-print response has been made to the latest image display switching notification, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and waits for an instruction from the user with respect to the latest image display switching notification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When it is determined in step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that the printer is not printing, the print <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> list is checked in step <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> as to whether or not the print list is empty. If it is empty, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. If it is determined in step <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> that the print list is not empty, the printer requests in step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> image data having image information (identification information of an image) at the head of the print list through the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, starts printing with the printer module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and deletes in step <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> the data at the head of the print list that the printer started printing. Then the printer prints image data (JPEG image file) received through the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a single unit, in step <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In this case, when the printer has received an image display switching notification <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for an image (1) from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), and a print instruction <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>A is given within the designated timeout period (step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sends a print response <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>), and adds image (identification) information to the last of the print list (step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). The printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> starts printing (step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>A), sends requests for image data bands <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> using the image information designated in the image display switching notification <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, receives transmissions of the image data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in response to the requests, and successively prints them (step <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>). The image (identification) information for the image (1) added to the print list in step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is deleted from the list in step <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> at the time when the printer starts printing in step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. After a required number of image data band requests and transmissions are repeated, the printing operation is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, displayed images are switched many times on the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during printing an image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an image display switching notification <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for an image (2) is made (step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) while the printer is printing the first image (1). Since this second image (2) is not printed, the printer sends a no-print notification <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>) after the timeout period <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>A (step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). More specifically, the printer receives an image data band transmission <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, and prints the same (step <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>). Then the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and to step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. As the image display switching notification <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for the image (2) is received, the printer presents the image display switching notification <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for the image (2) (step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). The process proceeds through &ldquo;No&rdquo; in step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, the printer sends an image data band request for the image (1) to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, receives an image data band from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and prints a single unit of the image (1). At this moment, when the timeout <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>A for the image (2) occurs while the image (1) is being printed, a no-print response for the image (2) is returned to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while the image data band for the image (1) is being received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When another image display switching notification <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for a still next image (3) is made during printing the first image (1), and there is a print instruction <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>A from the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to instruct that this image (3) be printed (step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), a print notification <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is immediately made (step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). At this moment, image information notified with respect to the image (3) is added to the print list (which is empty in the current state) within the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). More specifically, from the time the image display switching notification <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for the image (3) is received to the time when the print notification <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is returned to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the process proceeds through &ldquo;No&rdquo; in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;No&rdquo; in step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, to step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and if a print execution instruction is detected in step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the print notification <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is returned to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Then, the image information for the image (3) is added to the print list in step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> During printing the first image (1), another image display switching notification <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> for a yet another image (4) is made (step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>), and there is a print instruction <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>A to instruct that this image (4) be printed (step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), a print notification <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> is immediately made (step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). At this moment also, image information notified with respect to the image (4) is added to the print list (which has the information for the image (3) already written in the current state) within the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The printing of the first image (1) is completed with the image data band transmission <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> for the image (1). After the printing is completed (step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>A), the process proceeds through &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;No&rdquo; in step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;No&rdquo; in step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, to step <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> at which the print list is checked. Since the information for the image (3) and the image (4) are described in the print list, a printing operation is started (step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>A) for the first image (3) that has been stored earlier than the other, and a required number of image data band requests <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> and transmission are repeated to perform the printing operation (step <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>). Then, after the printing of the image (3) is completed, a printing operation for the image (4) is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In this example, one print is printed for each of the images. However, in another embodiment example, the printer may be structured so that multiple prints for each image can be printed. In this case, the number of prints for each image may be recorded in the print list, and prints of the recorded number may be printed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> By the structure described above, images displayed on the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be reliably printed. Also, even when displayed images on the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are switched while the printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is printing, information for the images are stored successively in the print list such that printing of the images is reserved, and all of the prints desired by the user can eventually be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a connection structure of a LAN in which printers (image printing apparatuses) <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g, </italic></highlight>a computer (image supply apparatus) <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and a projector (image display apparatus) <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> are mutually connected via network cables. The printers may be any printers including portable printers and color portable printers. The devices and apparatuses in the network can be mutually communicated through a network hub <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Each of the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is an image printing apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment. Each of the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>may have a structure similar to that of the image printing apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is connected through the network hub <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> to the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment assumes a situation such as a presentation or a seminar, where the speaker operates the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and the audiences can individually operate the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> of their own. In the embodiment example, a wired network is structured, but the present invention is also applicable to a wireless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> An image printing method applicable to the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> When the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> on the LAN are switched on, they can communicate with the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> on the same LAN. Each of the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> sends to the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> a request for an image list that describes information for all images to be displayed that are retained at the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and each of the devices receives and stores the image list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Then, when the user operates the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to switch a displayed image to another image, the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> sends an image display switching notification (an image number and a timeout value for the image in the image list) to the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Upon receiving the image display switching notification, the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> immediately sends a request for image data for the image to the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and displays the request. At this time, the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> displays the image, the image number of the displayed image, and remaining seconds for accepting the image for printing while counting down the remaining seconds. The remaining seconds may eventually reach a timeout, which allows the user of the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to know an appropriate timing when he can switch the displayed image. The user at the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can switch images anytime after the timeout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Each of the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g, </italic></highlight>which receives the image display switching notification from the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, displays the image number of the image on each display device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, for example, in an upper line in the display device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, and turns on an LED that is assembled in each print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> provided on each of the respective printers to notify to the users at the respective printers that there is the notification from the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. At the same time, each of the printers starts a countdown with the timeout information received being set as an initial value. For example, as the countdown reaches 5 seconds before the timeout, the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may be blinked, and when the countdown reaches the timeout, the LED <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> on the print button <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be turned off. The display device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may be included in the user interface shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Operations on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may be validated from the start of countdown to the timeout (while the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is continuously lit or is blinking), and invalidated in other cases (when the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> turns off). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another embodiment example, considering a time lag from the time the image display switching notification is received to the time the image is actually displayed on the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the timing to light the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (to validate operations on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>) may be delayed. Furthermore, in still another embodiment example, the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, after sending image data to the projector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, may send to the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>signal for lighting, blinking or turning off the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. In other words, in this embodiment example, the time measurement of a period in which the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can instruct printing is performed by the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, instead of the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment example, any of the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>which do not print a notified image shift to and stay in a power-saving standby mode. Furthermore, in accordance with still another embodiment, before depressing the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, other buttons (e.g., ten-keys, up/down keys, and the like in the user interface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) may be operated to designate the number of prints to be made for an image being displayed. The number of prints designated is displayed on a display device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of each of the corresponding printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>(for example, in a lower line in the display device <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>), and the image is printed in the number displayed at the time the print button is depressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Also, since each of the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>retains the information for all of the images to be displayed, in accordance with yet another embodiment, appropriate buttons on each of the printers may be operated to change the image numbers to select images, and printing of the selected images can be started without regard to whether or not these images are displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, to enable switching of displayed images even when any of the printers on the LAN are printing, a notification that is sent from the computer each time a displayed image is switched is immediately presented to the users at the respective printers even when the printers are printing. Furthermore, if notified images are to be printed by any of the printers, image numbers of the notified images are successively stored in those printers. When the on-going printing is completed, images corresponding to the stored image numbers can be printed even after the display of the images are completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> show flowcharts of process steps performed by the image printing apparatuses. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> indicate part of steps in a program for the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of each of the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>(hereafter generally referred to as the &ldquo;printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>&rdquo;). The CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> may be a microcomputer that runs the program read from the ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a storage medium that stores the program in a manner that the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can read out. In another configuration, the program may be stored in a floppy disk or a CD-ROM, and the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may read the program using a floppy disk driver or a CD-ROM driver (not shown in the drawing) and run the program. In this configuration, the floppy disk or the CD-ROM corresponds to a storage medium that stores the program in a manner that the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can read out. Also, the program may be supplied to the CPU from outside through the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Operations performed by the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> When the power is turned on, the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is placed in a state in which the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> can communicate with the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> obtains an image list describing information (number, identifiers such as file names, image numbers, image handles, comments, etc.) for all images retained by the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> through the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, in step <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> checks in step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> as to whether or not an image display switching notification (image number notification) has been present in the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. If the image display switching notification has arrived, the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> renews the display content displayed on the display device, and waits an instruction from the user while turning on the LED in the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> sets the timeout information included in the image display switching notification to an initial value and starts a countdown. In other words, when the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> receives an image display switching notification from the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the LED installed in the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> turns on to indicate that the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be operated to print an image corresponding to the image number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Then, in step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, a determination as to the timeout is made, and in step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, a determination as to the presence or absence of a print execution instruction is made. In step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, the display device on the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> displays the number of an image corresponding to the image display switching notification, which is displayed after switching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> If the timeout is reached in step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, it is determined that the notified image is not to be printed, and the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is turned off in step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. The timeout indicates that a period in which the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can instruct a printing operation is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> If a print execution is instructed in step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is turned off in step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, and the notified image number is added to the last of the print list retained in the RAM <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> When no instruction of a print execution is found in step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, a period of time until the timeout is reached is checked, and a determination is made as to whether or not an image display switching should be notified in step <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. If the period of time until the timeout is reached is shorter than a pre-set period of time, this is notified to the user by, for example, blinking the LED within the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment example, the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may send to the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> a signal for lighting, flashing or turning off the LED on the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. In other words, in this embodiment example, the time measurement of a period in which the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can instruct printing is performed by the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, instead of the printers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> When a series of processing steps which starts in step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is completed, a determination is made again in step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> as to whether the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is currently printing. If it is printing, a printing process in a single unit is conducted in step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The printing process in a single unit may be defined as a finely divided process such as a process for one line of the image at a time. For example, in this embodiment example, when an image display switching notification from the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is detected through polling, the printing process is divided and progressed bit by bit so that the response will not be extremely delayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As the printing process is progressed, a determination is made in step <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> as to whether or not the LED on the print button is turned off (operations on the print button are invalidated). If the LED is turned off, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and the next image display switching notification is checked. On the other hand, when the LED is lit or blinking, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and waits for an instruction from the user with respect to the latest image display switching notification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> When it is determined in step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> that the printer is not printing, the print list is checked in step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> as to whether or not the print list is empty. If it is empty, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. If it is determined in step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> that the print list is not empty, the printer requests in step <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> image data having the image number at the head of the print list through the network I/F <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, starts printing with the printer module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and deletes in step <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> the data at the head of the print list that the printer started printing. Then the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> prints image data (JPEG image file) received from the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> at the printer section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, in step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In this case, after having received an image display switching notification <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> from the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), when there is a print instruction <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>A given within the designated timeout period (step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>), the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> starts printing (step <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>), and sends requests for image data bands for the designated image number (<highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>), receives the image data bands in response to the requests from the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>), and successively prints them (step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). A required number requests for and transmissions of image data bands are repeated, the printing operation is completed with the transmission of the last image data band <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> operates in the same manner as in the case when an image displayed is not printed (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a case in which an image displayed on the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is printed, and image display switching notifications are issued even during printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In this case, after the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> has received an image display switching notification <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> from the computer (step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), and there is a print instruction to print an image (1) given from the print button <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>A), the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> starts printing (step <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>A), requests image data bands for the designated image number (<highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>), receives the image data bands responding to the requests (<highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>), and performs a printing process in single units (step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). The image number for the image (1) is written in the print list in step <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, but deleted from the print list in step <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> when the printer starts printing in step <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. A required number of image data band requests and transmissions are repeated, the printing operation is completed with the transmission of the last image data band <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, displayed images are switched many times on the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> during printing an image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, an image display switching notification <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> for the next image (2) is made (step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>) while the printer is printing the first image (1). Since this second image (2) is not printed, the timeout is reached (step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Also, while the first image (1) is being printed, an image display switching notification <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> for a still another image (3) is issued (step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>), and if there is a print instruction <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>A to instruct that this image be printed (step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>), the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> immediately adds a notified image number for the image (3) to the print list (which is empty in the current state) within the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Also, while the first image (1) is being printed, an image display switching notification <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> for a yet another image (4) is issued (step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>), and if there is a print instruction <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>A to instruct that this image be printed (step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>), the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> immediately adds a notified image number for the image (4) to the print list (which already contains a description of the information for the image (3) in the current state) within the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The printing operation for the image (1) is completed with the last image data band transmission <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> for the image (1). After completing the printing operation (step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>), the print list is checked (step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>). Since the information for the images (3) and (4) is described in the print list, a required number of image data band requests <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and transmissions <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> for the image (3) at the head of the print list are repeated to print the image (3) (step <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> After the printing operation for the image (3) is completed, the image (4) is printed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment example, one print for each image is printed. However, in another embodiment, the printer is structure such that multiple prints for each image can be printed. In such a structure, the number of prints for each image may be recorded in the print list, and prints for each image in the number recorded will be printed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In the mean time, the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> requests and receives image data at each of the image display switching notifications <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> sent form the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and display the image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> By the structure described above, images displayed on the projector <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> can be reliably printed. Also, even when displayed images are switched by the computer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> while the printer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is printing, information for the images are stored successively in the print list such that printing of the images is reserved, and all of the prints desired by the user can eventually be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Also, the system may be structured such that an information list containing all images to be displayed may be received in advance by all of the printers, and responses are not returned to image switching notifications. By this structure, data transfer prior to a presentation (for preparation of the presentation) may take time, but the amount of data to be transferred at the time of image switching operations during the presentation can be reduced. By such a structure, it is expected that image switching operations can be performed more effectively when many more devices are connected to the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, in addition to the structures of all of the embodiments described so far, the printing apparatus may be equipped with an image storage device having a large storing capacity for storing images. Received image data may be successively stored in the storage device on the printing apparatus instead of printing the image data, or may be successively stored and printed at the same time. The printing apparatus may further be equipped with a device that selects between printing and storing received image data. Furthermore, in another embodiment, the printing apparatus may be equipped with a memory card device with a card slot, and the user may load his own memory card on the memory card device such that the user can carry image data on the memory card, or both of prints and image data on the memory card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments described above, when the operator who transfers image data may set a flag on the image data that permits or prohibits to re-edit or re-distribute the image data. When the printing apparatus receives image data with a flag that permits only printing, the printing apparatus prints the image data, but does not store the image data in the image storage device. In other words, the printing apparatus may be equipped with a device that detects or determines if storage of the received data is permitted, and controls the storage of image data according to the detected or determined result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Also, in another embodiment, the printing apparatus may allow to store image data in the image storage device only when printing media such as recording paper are not available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Further, the printing apparatus may be provided with a structure that allows the user to select between printing and storing images being displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> While the description above refers to particular embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood that many modifications may be made without departing from the spirit thereof. The accompanying claims are intended to cover such modifications as would fall within the true scope and spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The presently disclosed embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
