<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a post-tensioned pole system. In particular, the present invention relates to a post-tensioned pole system includes one or more precast segments which are coupled to one another by a connector and post-tensioned through the use of at least one strand that is external to the wall thickness of the pole segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is well known that poles are used in a wide variety of applications including electrical transmission and distribution environments, lighting, telecommunications and as supports for wind energy turbines. When used in these environments, the poles are subjected to forces from the wind, water and structural loads such as the weight of wire transmission lines or a wind turbine. These forces create a moment or torque that the pole must resist in order to remain in an upright position. In resisting these forces, the pole has a tendency to flex thereby putting the bottom portion of the pole in compression and the top portion of the pole in tension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the past, the poles have been formed of various materials such as steel, wood, concrete, masonry materials and any combination thereof. The use of concrete to form the poles is relatively common due to its availability. However, the use of concrete to form the poles suffers from a number of drawbacks. For instance, while concrete is capable of withstanding a substantial amount of compression force, its ability to resist tension is considerably low. Therefore, different techniques have been established in an effort to enhance the concretes ability to withstand the tension forces imposed on the pole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One technique used to enhance the ability of the concrete to withstand tension forces is pre-tensioning. Pre-tensioning the concrete has been accomplished by embedding strands within the concrete walls of the concrete using a spun or static cast technique. In the static cast method, the strands are arranged within the form prior to pouring the concrete. Both ends of each strand are jacked to place the strands in tension. The concrete is then placed into the form embedding the strands therein. The strands are cut after the concrete has gained adequate strength, releasing the force to the concrete. The tension in the strands places the concrete pole into compression thereby allowing it to withstand a greater amount of tension force. The spun cast technique is similar to the static method in that the strands are placed in the form prior to the addition of the concrete. However, instead of placing the concrete into a static form, the concrete is poured into a machine that spins the concrete forcing the concrete to the outer walls of the form and embedding the strands within the wall of the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned pre-tensioning techniques also suffer from a number of deficiencies. One problem with the spun cast method is that the concrete aggregate separates due to centrifugal force thereby making concrete weak and susceptible to cracking due to unequal distribution of aggregate. In addition, the equipment used to spin the concrete is expensive. In addition, both of the aforementioned methods of pre-tensioning concrete poles are problematic in that it takes a considerable amount of time to properly position the strands in the form prior to pouring the concrete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Additionally, there other problems associated with current concrete pole structures. For example, the concrete structures that are used in these environments are typically unitary structures that extend to a height of about 80-90 feet. This is problematic because certain power transmission line applications may require the poles to extend to greater heights. Additionally, given the fact that poles are a unitary structure, it is very difficult to transport the pole structures from an off-site location to the construction site. Once the poles arrive at the site, they require large cranes and heavy machinery to lift them into position due to the weight and length of the pole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there remains a need for a segmental post-tensioned pole system that increases maximum height of pole while reducing the difficulty in transporting the pole from off-site location to the construction site. In addition, there is also a need to simplify the installation and manufacture of the pole. The present invention fills these needs as well as various other needs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome the above-stated problems and limitations, and to achieve the noted objects, there is provided a precast post-tensioned segmental pole system that is capable of supporting a load and withstanding other external forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In general, the pole system includes several pole segments with similar connectors anchoring them together. For example, the first and second pole segments each have top and bottom ends with a cavity formed therein. The connector is adapted to couple the top end of the first pole segment with the bottom end of the second pole segment. The connector includes upper and lower pieces. The upper piece includes a channel band coupled to the second pole segment and having an inner edge. The connector further includes a stiffener being disposed within the channel band. The lower piece includes a base plate coupled to the first pole segment and a cover plate coupled to the base plate and having an outer edge that is adapted to interlock with an inner edge of the upper piece. The strands are placed in tension and can either continue through or be anchored at any of the segment connectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the pole system may also include an anchor that couples the anchored strand to the connector. The anchor may include a cylinder, a clasping mechanism slidably received within the cylinder, a pipe coupled to the cylinder and a spring mounted within the pipe. The spring retains the clasping mechanism within the cylinder when the strand is coupled when the clasping mechanism is releasably coupled to the anchored strand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further objects, features, and advantages of the present invention over the prior art will become apparent from the detailed description of the drawings which follows, when considered with the attached figures.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings in detail, and initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally designates a post-tensioned segmental pole system constructed in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. Pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include one or more pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> coupled to one another by a connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to form a monopole structure. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a plurality of strands or tendons <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that extend through a hollow interior cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and which are external to pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are placed under tension and coupled between pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used to support a load such as a structural appurtenance, insulator anchor, antenna in various types of service environments including, but not limited, to electrical transmission and distribution, lighting, communications and wind power generation. In addition, pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also withstand external forces such as, but not limited to, wind, water and the like. It will be understood that a number of pole systems may be used in conjunction to form a multi-pole system to increase the height capability of pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For instance, a number of pole systems may be arranged in a tripod configuration to provide support for a single pole system that would extend upwardly from the apex of the tripod. This configuration would essentially double the overall height capabilities of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include one to four pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that may form a monopole structure of up to 120 feet (36 meters). With additional reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, each pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be approximately 30 feet (9 meters) in length having a tapered hexagonal cross-section. It is desirable to use a pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a cross-section that has stiffness characteristics that are independent of lateral applied loads such as, but not limited to, wind or wave forces. Therefore, it is preferable to use a pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a radial symmetrical cross-section with a flat outer surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that appurtenances may be fastened to pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Although a hexagonal cross-section is described and shown herein, it is within the scope of the present invention to use a pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having cross-section in the shape of an octagon or any other radially symmetric cross-sectional shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, outer surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of pole segment may be tapered at the rate of 1 inch (25 mm) over a distance of 10 feet as pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extends from a bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a top portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, an inner surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also tapers inwardly at approximately the same rate as outer surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and defines hollow interior cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Top portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of inner surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may include a thickened portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> where inner surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> tapers inwardly at a greater rate compared to bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of inner surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Thickened portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may begin at an intermediate portion of inner surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and extend to a rim <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at top portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Further, a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed in inner surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and extend through thickened portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to a top surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are hexagonally disposed within hollow interior cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and adapted to allow strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to pass therethrough. The number of apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed in segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably corresponds with the number of strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extending within cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be formed of various types of concrete including, but not limited to, high performance concrete (HPC) which is capable of higher than normal compressive strengths. High performance concrete utilizes fibers that are used to reinforce the concrete instead of using standard reinforced bars to enhance the concrete strength. The high performance concrete may have a minimum compressive strength of 8000 pounds per square inch, a RCP factor of 1000 coulombs, and a minimum freeze-thaw capacity for cold weather environments. However, pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also utilize reinforcement bars or welded wire fabric within the walls of pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to increase the strength of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is used to couple two pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to one another. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, connector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes an upper piece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a lower piece <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Upper piece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes a channel band <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a plurality of studs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Studs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are mounted within bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With additional reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, channel band <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes top and bottom plates <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a cross piece <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and a stiffener <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Top plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is fixedly coupled to studs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and extends inwardly towards cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Cross piece <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extends downwardly from top plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and is coupled to bottom plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Bottom plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends inwardly and parallel with top plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</cross-reference>, bottom plate has a inner edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that is adapted to interlock with lower piece <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Although, inner edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is in the shape of a hexagon, it should be understood that it may be formed in any shape that will allow it to interlock with lower piece <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Stiffeners <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extend between top and bottom plates <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and are used to stiffen channel band <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>, lower piece <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is mounted to top portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is used to interlock with upper piece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Lower piece <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> includes a cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a base plate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and studs <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Studs <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are mounted within top portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of pole segment and is fixedly mounted to base plate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Base plate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is a hexagonal ring and has a support surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is also a hexagonal ring and mounted to a portion of a support surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on base plate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Further, cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes an outer edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> adapted to interlock with inner edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of channel band <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Although outer edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is shaped in the form of a hexagon, it should be understood and appreciated that outer edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be other shapes that will allow it to interlock with inner edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of channel band <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Outer edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is sized so that there is a gap <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> between inner edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and outer edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. However, gap <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is small enough that the rotation between channel band <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is minimized. Cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> also includes a rim <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that may be aligned with rim <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed in top portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has a plurality of holes <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> formed therein that are aligned with apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed in thickened portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may pass therethrough. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>, cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> also has a top surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> where one or more strand anchors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> may be mounted thereon which will be described more fully below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The post-tensioning of pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is accomplished through the use of a plurality of strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that extend within hollow interior cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, but which are external to the walls of pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are adapted to be placed in tension so that pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are capable of withstanding an increased amount of tensile force. Strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be 0.5 inches (12 mm) in diameter and arranged within cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. In particular, strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be arranged in repeats on each of the side of the hexagonal cross-section of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so the resulting radial symmetry provides relatively constant moments of inertia for flexural stiffness independent of lateral force direction. With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may extend through thickened portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to ensure that strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are positioned near inner surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to allow them to make a maximum contribution to flexural stiffness. One strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may extend from bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and be coupled to top end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the same pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In addition, strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may also extend from bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a base pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a top portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of a pole segment positioned on top of the base pole segment. Further, strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may continue to extend to a pole segment further up the pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>, strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are coupled to top portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the use of at least one anchor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Specifically, anchor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> rests against top surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and prevents strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from being pulled downwardly towards bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Anchors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> include a cylinder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> having a clamping mechanism <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> slidably coupled within an interior portion of cylinder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Clamping mechanism <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is a two-piece jaw structure having a variable diameter hole formed therein. The hole is tapered as it extends through the jaws and has one or more teeth or protrusions extending therein to grip and hold onto strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Anchor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> further includes a pipe <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> with a helical spring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> fixedly mounted therein. Pipe <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted to the top ring of cylinder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and spring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is positioned to bias jaws <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> toward top surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In operation, pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be a single pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> used alone, or in combination with one or more pole segments. A single or monopole system may extend to a height of 30 feet. Therefore, a system with four pole segments may extends to a height of 120 feet. Furthermore, a tripod system may extend to a height of approximately 240 feet. If one pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is used by itself as the supporting structure, strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are fed through hollow interior cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of pole segment and threaded through apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> portion of each strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that extends through holes <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is coupled to anchor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In particular, strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pushed upwardly against jaws <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to place the end portion of strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> within the hole formed between jaws <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. As strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is being pushed upwardly,jaws <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> slide upwardly to compress spring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Spring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> prevents the jaws <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> from being dislodged from cylinder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The angled portion of the jaws slides along an inner edge of cylinder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the jaws splits apart. Once jaws <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> open enough to allow strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to enter the inner diameter, the upward force on strands is release and spring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> biased jaws <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> downwardly so that the hold formed between the jaws decreases and the teeth within the hole grips onto strand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The remaining strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are coupled to top portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of pole segment in a similar fashion. Strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> then proceed to extend downwardly to bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed in a foundation hole and backfill such as compact fill, flowable concrete mix or reinforced concrete is added to the hole to support pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are placed in tension by jacking or by other conventional methods to complete the post-tensioned pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Two or more pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may also be used to form pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are first fed through hollow interior cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the bottom or base pole segment and external to the pole segment structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are threaded through apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Some of strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are then coupled to top surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by anchors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as described in detail above. The remaining strands continue to extend through the hollow interior cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the second pole segment. Bottom plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is placed on support surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and inner edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is interlocked with outer edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>. Thus, the second pole segment is resting on top of the bottom or base pole segment. The remaining strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are threaded through apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the second pole segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> All the remaining strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be coupled to cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the second pole segment by using strand anchors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, or in the alternative, some strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be coupled to cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> while the remaining strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> continue to extend to a third pole segment. This process may continue in a similar fashion as described above until the desired height is achieved. For example, in a four pole system as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, thirty-six strands may extend within the cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of a bottom or base pole segment. At the juncture between the base segment and second segment, twelve of those strands may be mounted to cover plate on the base segment and twenty-four would continue to extend within cavity of the second pole segment. The juncture between the second and third pole segments is best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. At this juncture, twelve of those strands may be mounted to cover plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the second pole segment and twelve would continue to extend within cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the third pole segment. At the juncture between the third and fourth pole segments, six of those strands may be mounted to cover plate of the third pole segment and six would continue to extend within cavity of the fourth pole segment. Finally, the six remaining strands would then be coupled to the cover plate of the fourth pole segment. It will be understood that the joining of pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be conducted on the ground so the pole segments extend in a horizontal direction, or may be stacked on top of each other for vertical construction. Regardless of the number of strands in pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the multi-segmented construction are then placed in tension to create a post-tensioned pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and placed in the appropriate foundation as described above. In addition, concrete may then be poured through rims <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> into hollow interior portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in either the single or multi-pole segment structures to create a solid pole structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The present invention further includes a mold unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that may be used to precast pole segments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that are used in pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Mold unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> includes an external mold <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, internal mold <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and a yoke <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Mold unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> shown in the accompanying drawings is an example of a typical mold structure, and it will be understood that the proportions of the molds may vary depending on where the pole segment will be located in the pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For instance, a pole segment that will be positioned at the base or bottom of pole system will be much larger than a mold for a segment that will be positioned at the upper portions of pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, external mold <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> includes a bottom piece <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and a pair of top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. In particular, top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are coupled to bottom piece <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> by a set of hinges <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which allow external mold <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to be placed in closed and open positions. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, external mold <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is in a closed position where bottom piece <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are arranged to form a channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which will define the outer surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In addition, channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> may also taper inwardly along the longitudinal axis of external mold <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> may be rotated outwardly about hinges <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> so that external mold <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is in the open position so that pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be removed from external mold <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, external mold <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> also has a plurality of bolts <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> adjustably mounted within bottom piece <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Bolts <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are mounted within bottom piece <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> so that a portion of each bolt <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> can be independently adjusted to extend variable distances within channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and contact internal mold <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. It is also within the scope of this invention to include bolts <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Yoke <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is removably coupled to a top surface <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and has a bolt <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> mounted thereto that is adapted to extend within channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and contact internal mold <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Yoke <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is used to prevent top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> from floating or rotating relative to bottom piece <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> when the concrete is placed within mold unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, internal mold <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is tubular member having a top piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a bottom piece <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a plurality of tubes <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. With additional reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, bottom piece has an outer surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that has a similar taper compared to channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, but is sized so there is a space between channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and outer surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Further, a collar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> removably couples bottom piece <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to top piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. An outer surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of top piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> extends upwardly from collar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at the same taper as bottom piece <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and then proceeds to narrow even further as it extends toward a rim <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The increased taper towards the top portion of top piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> creates a larger space between channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and outer surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to allow for the formation of thickened portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Tubes <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are used to form apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in thickened portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In particular, tubes <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are mounted to top piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and extend outwardly therefrom in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of top and bottom pieces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The distal ends of tubes <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are tapered to make it easier to remove tubes with top and bottom pieces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> after the concrete hardens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, top piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may also have a uniform taper that is similar to bottom piece <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as it extends from collar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to rim <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. To change top pieces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, collar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is loosened, and the new top piece is slid onto bottom piece <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Collar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is tightened and the change is complete. The uniform taper in top piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> results in a pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with uniform wall thickness along its entire length. In this case, there would be no thickened portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> or apertures formed in pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> since strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may pass through hollow interior cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> without interfering with the walls of pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In forming a pole segment using mold unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> on external mold <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are rotated outwardly about hinges <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to an open position. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, internal mold <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is then placed within channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and supported by bolts <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Bolts <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are adjusted in such a manner so that there is an equal amount of space between channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and outer surfaces <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of internal mold <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are then moved to the closed position. Yoke <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is then placed on top surface <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and is coupled to each top piece <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to prevent top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> from rotating outwardly relative to bottom piece <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Concrete is then poured between channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and outer surfaces <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. After the concrete cures, internal mold <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is removed from the hardened pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereby forming hollow interior cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and apertures <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Yoke <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is then removed from top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and top pieces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are moved to the open position. Pole segment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may them be removed from external mold <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and used in pole system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that pole segments may be formed either at an off-site location or a construction site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It can, therefore, be seen that the invention is one that is designed to overcome the drawbacks and deficiencies existing in the prior art. The invention provides a pole system that includes one or more pole segments that are post-tensioned by strands that are positioned within a hollow interior cavity and external to the wall structure of the pole segments. The use of separate pole segments to form the pole system reduces the difficulty in transporting the components of the pole system. Each pole segment is relatively easy to maneuver and lift through the use of a crane, winch system, or helicopter to simplify installation. In addition, the fact that the strands are positioned within the hollow interior cavity of the pole segment reduces the amount of time it takes to manufacture the pole segments since each strand does not have to be positioned within the form prior to pouring the concrete in the form. Further, the connectors provided in the present invention simplify the process of coupling two pole segments to one another. Additionally, the forms of the present invention eliminates the need to purchase expensive spinning equipment for forming pole segments having a interior cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> While particular embodiments of the invention have been shown, it will be understood, of course, that the invention is not limited thereto, since modifications may be made by those skilled in the art, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings. Reasonable variation and modification are possible within the scope of the foregoing disclosure of the invention without departing from the spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
