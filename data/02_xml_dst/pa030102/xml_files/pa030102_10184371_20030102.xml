<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a quantum cryptography multi-node network and a method of distributing a key on a multi-node network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Conventional Techniques </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a conventional cryptography, decryption is possible theoretically by obtaining an answer of a kind of mathematical problem. However, an enormous time is necessary to calculate the answer by a computer at present, and the decryption is difficult actually. In this way, the conventional cryptography is based on computationally secure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a quantum cryptography is unconditionally secure cryptography which is based on a physical law. Therefore, the quantum crypt cannot be decrypted even if there is a computer with infinite ability. Therefore, unconditional safety of a method of sharing a secret key of a common key cryptogram safely between two nodes is proved based on the law of quantum mechanics. The cryptography method is called a quantum key distribution protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The quantum key distribution protocol is a procedure in which a part of a signal with a quantum level transferred on a quantum communication channel is sampled and the secret key of the common key cryptogram is determined while a measurement result is confirmed on a public communication channel by classical communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is guaranteed based on the uncertainty-principle that a mark of interception of the transmitted signal is always left in the transmitted signal of the quantum level. By comparing the mark with data obtained on a public communication channel through classical communication, it is possible to estimate an upper limit of an amount of information intercepted by a false receiver. Also, it is possible to bring the amount of information intercepted by the false receiver close to zero by the technique of the classical privacy amplification protocol in exchange for shortening of the length of the left key, if the amount of information intercepted by the false receiver does not exceed a certain limit. Thus, the safety is unconditionally proved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The secret key can be always exchanged if quantum cryptography is used. The secure communication becomes possible unconditionally by combining the quantum cryptography with the one-time-pad method which is a common key cryptogram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For the quantum key distribution protocols, various protocols are proposed such as 4-state cryptography, 2-particle interference cryptography, non-orthogonal 2-state cryptography, and time difference interference cryptography. These protocols are described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (JP-P2000-286841A) in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In these quantum key distribution protocols, generally, a single photon is used as a signal of a quantum level, and an optical fiber communication channel or a spatial light communication channel is used as a quantum communication channel. In this case, it is required to provide a private communication channel between a transmitter node and a receiver node for the key distribution. For this reason, when the distribution of the quantum cryptographic key should be carried out between the four terminals <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, it is required to provide six private communication channels <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> between the four terminals, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In conjunction with the above description, a key distribution system using a quantum cryptography is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent application (JP-A-Heisei 8-505019). In this reference, a communication method uses a quantum cryptography to encode and decode a signal. A key is distributed on a quantum communication channel, and data is transmitted from a transmitter node to a receiver node on a public communication channel to determine whether or not the key is intercepted on the quantum communication channel. Common communication medium is used for the quantum communication and the public communication. A calibration signal is transmitted on the public communication channel of the common communication medium to calibrate a system for transmitting the key on the quantum communication channel. The communication medium may be an optical fiber. The transmitting units may be switched between the output of a single photon for a quantum communication and the output of multiple photons for the public communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Also, quantum cryptography on a multi-node connection network is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent application (JP-A-Heisei 9-502320). In the quantum cryptography in this reference, a transmitter node communicates with some of receiver nodes on the quantum communication channel. The receiver nodes are arranged in different branches of a common communication network. This method establishes a secret key different for each receiver node. To synchronize the receiver node before transmission on the quantum communication channel, a timing pulse is transmitted from the transmitter node to the receiver node. Signals on the quantum communication channel are multiplexed and data is transmitted simultaneously with classical multiplexed photon transmission on the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, an optical communication apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent application (JP-A-Heisei 10-290213). In this reference, optical signals multiplexed with different wavelengths light is branched on the way of a transmission route. An optical communication device can absorb the optical signal with the wavelength shorter than a wavelength corresponding to an applied reverse bias potential and demodulate the absorbed signal into an electric signal. Also, the optical communication device can transmit the optical signal with the wavelength longer than the wavelength corresponding to the applied reverse bias potential. The optical communication device is comprised of a pair of front stage and end stage electric field absorption type modulation devices. A reverse bias supply circuit applies the reverse bias potentials to the modulation devices in such a manner that the bias potential on the front stage is lower than that of the end stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also, a quantum cryptography communication system is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (JP-P2000-101570A). In this reference, interception is detected based on the change of a probability distribution in quantum mechanics due to the interception. The distribution is defined by the amplitude and phase of an optical signal. The optical signal from a transmitter node is split into a reference signal strong in intensity and a transmission signal feeble to the extent that the change of a state in the quantum mechanics can be detected. In the transmission, a phase difference is applied between the reference signal and the transmission signal. The difference is determined between the two output lights in the relation of the opposite phase to each other by combining the reference signal and the transmission signal. A secret key is shared between the transmitter node and the receiver node based on a frequency distribution of the difference between the output lights which depend on the fluctuation of a quantum state of the transmission signal. In addition, the fluctuation of the quantum state of the transmission signal is directly detected. At this time, the state of the transmission signal is determined based on reference values which are set to a signal of the difference between the output lights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Also, a method of distributing a key using a quantum cryptography is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (JP-P2000-286841A). In this reference, a transmitter node modulates a first signal by making 1-bit data correspond to two orthogonal states in quantum mechanics. At this time, the transmitter node selects two orthogonal states from quantum mechanical states randomly every the first signal. The first signal is transmitted to the receiver node on a quantum communication channel to distribute a random number table. After the first signal reaches the receiver node, the transmitter node notifies a method of measuring the first signal to the receiver node through a classical communication channel. The receiver node keeps the received first signal for a predetermined time, and produces a random number table from the 1-bit data obtained through the measurement based on the method of measuring the first signal. The transmitter node and the receiver node extract test data from the transmitted random number tables and the received random number table, respectively, and check the test data by notifying the extracted test data each other through the classical communication channel for confirming that there is not interception. Then, the random number table from which the test data is excluded is used as a common key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Also, a quantum encrypt apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (JP-P2000-517499A). In this reference, at least two light pulses are transmitted through a quantum communication channel. An interference generated the light pulse is detected at one of stations. The light pulses which interfere with each other are transferred on a same branch as that of an interferometer. However, the light pulses are delayed in another sequence when they are transferred on the quantum communication channel. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a quantum cryptography multi-node communication network system in which quantum crypts are transmitted and received between multi-nodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a quantum cryptography multi-node communication network system, in which a crypt key can be shared between unspecified nodes on a network, while keeping the principle of quantum cryptography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In an aspect of the present invention, a quantum cryptography multi-node communication system includes a quantum communication channel and a plurality of nodes including a transmitter node and a receiver node and connected with the quantum communication channel. The transmitter node transmits a light signal as a time series of photons to the receiver node through the quantum communication channel, a quantum state of the photons is modulated, and transmits a quantum state sequence to the receiver node. The receiver node predetermines a quantum state sequence, receives the light signal transmitted from the transmitter node, measures quantum states of the received light signal, and determines presence or absence of interception based on the predetermined quantum state sequence, the transmitted quantum state sequence and the measured quantum states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Here, a single route may be predetermined between the transmitter node and the receiver node. In this case, it is desirable that a reception wavelength of the light signal is assigned to each of the plurality of nodes, and that the receiver node receives the light signal as the time series of photons with the assigned wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also, the plurality of nodes may include a plurality of the receiver nodes. At this time, a same wavelength of the light signal may be assigned to the plurality of receiver nodes. In addition, each of the plurality of receiver nodes may receive the light signal with the assigned wavelength, and output the light signal with the assigned wavelength onto the quantum communication channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also, each of the plurality of nodes may connected with the quantum communication channel via a passive optical unit. At this time, the passive optical unit may include a passive wavelength dependent splitter and a passive wavelength dependent combiner. The passive wavelength dependent splitter splits a first light signal component with at least one predetermined first wavelength from the light signal on the quantum communication channel to output to the node. The passive wavelength dependent combiner combines a second light signal component with at least one predetermined second wavelength outputted from the node and the light signal in which the first light signal component is split and outputs the combined light signal onto the quantum communication channel. In this case, it is desirable that the first light signal component is same as the second light signal component. Also, it is desirable that the first wavelength is same as the second wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Also, when the node outputs the second light signal component with a plurality of the second wavelengths, the passive wavelength dependent combiner may include first and second splitters, a plurality of first combiners and a second combiner. The first splitter splits the light signal, in which the first light signal component is split, into first signal components with different wavelengths. The second splitter splits the second light signal component into second signal components with different wavelengths. Each of the plurality of first combiners combines one of the first signal components and a corresponding one of the second signal components to produce a combined signal component. The second combiner combines the combined signal components to output the light signal onto the quantum communication channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Also, the transmitter node may include a transmission quantum state order storage section, a light signal generating section and a transmission section. The transmission quantum state order storage section stores a quantum state sequence. The light signal generating section generates the light signal as the time series of photons having a predetermined wavelength and modulated based on the quantum states stored in the transmission quantum state order storage section. The transmission section transmits the light signal onto the quantum communication channel, and outputs the quantum state sequence to the receiver node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Also, the receiver node may include a first quantum state storage section which stores the predetermined quantum state sequence. A quantum state measuring section receives the light signal transmitted from the transmitter node through the quantum communication channel, and measures the measured quantum state sequence from the received light signal based on the predetermined quantum state sequence. A second quantum state storage section stores the measured quantum state sequence by the quantum state measuring section. A third quantum state storage section stores the transmitted quantum state sequence from the transmitter node, after the reception of the signal light. A first comparing section compares the predetermined quantum state sequence and the transmitted quantum state sequence to detect coincident quantum states. A fourth quantum state storage section stores ones of the measured quantum states corresponding to the coincident quantum states as a comparison resultant quantum state sequence. A second comparing section compares sampled quantum states which are randomly sampled from the comparison resultant quantum state sequence and ones of the measured quantum state sequence corresponding to the sampled quantum states. A determining section determines the presence or absence of interception based on the comparing result by the second comparing section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, a quantum cryptography apparatus to be connected with a quantum communication channel, includes a first quantum state storage section which stores first quantum states of a signal light in a predetermined order. A quantum state measuring section receives the signal light which is transmitted through the quantum communication channel, and measures second quantum states of the signal light from the received signal light based on the first quantum states of the signal light stored in the first quantum state storage section. A second quantum state storage section stores the second quantum states of the signal light which are measured by the quantum state measuring section. A third quantum state storage section stores the first quantum states of the signal light which are transmitted after the reception of the signal light. A first comparing section compares the first quantum states stored in the first quantum state storage section and the first quantum states stored in the third quantum state storage section to detect coincident quantum states. A fourth quantum state storage section stores ones of the measured second quantum states corresponding to the coincident quantum states. A second comparing section compares the second quantum states which are randomly sampled from the second quantum states stored in the fourth quantum state storage section and ones of the measured second quantum states corresponding to the sampled second quantum states. A determining section determines presence or absence of interception based on the comparing result by the second comparing section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Here, the quantum cryptography apparatus may transmit the signal light as a time series of photons to a receiver node through the quantum communication channel, a quantum state of the photons is modulated, and transmits the quantum states of the signal light to a receiver node. In this case, the quantum cryptography apparatus may further include a transmission quantum state order storage section, a light signal generating section and a transmission section. The transmission quantum state order storage section stores the quantum states of the signal light. The light signal generating section generates the signal light and modulated based on the quantum states stored in the transmission quantum state order storage section. The transmission section transmits the signal light onto the quantum communication channel, and outputs the quantum states of the signal light to the receiver node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also, a single route may be predetermined between the transmitter node and the receiver node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Also, a reception wavelength of the signal light may be assigned to the quantum cryptography apparatus, and the quantum cryptography apparatus may receive the signal light as the time series of photons with the assigned wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, a key delivering method in a multi-node network, is achieved: by (a) transmitting a light signal as a time series of photons from a transmitter node to a receiver node through a quantum communication channel, a quantum state of the photons is modulated; by (b) transmitting a quantum state sequence from the transmitter node to the receiver node; by (c) receiving the light signal transmitted from the transmitter node, and measuring a quantum state sequence of the received light signal; and by (d) determining presence or absence of interception based on a quantum state sequence predetermined on the receiver node, the transmitted quantum state sequence and the measured quantum state sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Here, a single route may be predetermined between the transmitter node and the receiver node. In this case, a reception wavelength of the light signal may be assigned to each of the plurality of nodes. The (c) receiving step is achieved by receiving the light signal as the time series of photons with the assigned wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Also, a plurality of nodes may be connected with the quantum communication channel and includes a plurality of the receiver nodes, and a same wavelength of the light signal may be assigned to the plurality of receiver nodes. The (c) receiving step is achieved by each of the plurality of receiver nodes receiving the light signal with the assigned wavelength, and outputting the light signal with the assigned wavelength onto the quantum communication channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Also, the (a) transmitting step may be achieved by generating the light signal as the time series of photons having a predetermined wavelength; by modulating the light signal based on a first quantum state sequence; and by transmitting the light signal from the transmitter node to the receiver node through the quantum communication channel. </paragraph>

Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the multi-node network, a transmitter node <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as one of the nodes encodes a single photon or a time series of photons based on key data necessary for protocols such as 4-state cryptography, 2-particle interference cryptography, non-orthogonal 2-state cryptography, and time difference interference cryptography, and delivers to one selected from among receiver nodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A quantum cryptography encoder and a quantum cryptography decoder which are provided on boards as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and are installed in a node of the transmitter node <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and nodes of the receiver nodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively. It is possible to carry out a quantum key distribution protocol between the transmitter node and the receiver node using this system. That is, it is possible to carry out the quantum key distribution protocol in usual peer-to-peer communication between the transmitter node and the receiver node using this system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The transmitter node <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> encodes the quantum key, and outputs a time series of wavelength controlled single photons to an asymmetrical waveguide interference system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through a branch line optical fiber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The asymmetrical waveguide interference system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a 2-input and 1-output asymmetrical Mach-Zehnder interference system formed using the optical fiber, and operates as a signal wavelength multiplexing unit. The single photon time series <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> reaches an asymmetrical waveguide interference system <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through a trunk line optical fiber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The asymmetrical waveguide interference system <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is same as the asymmetrical waveguide interference system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and operates as a 1-input and 2-output signal wavelength splitter. One of the two outputs is connected with the trunk line optical fiber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the other output is connected with a branch line optical fibers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The asymmetrical waveguide interference system <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is designed to split only the photons with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the branch line optical fiber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The asymmetrical waveguide interference system <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is designed to split only the photons with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into the branch line optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The asymmetrical light waveguide interference system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is designed to split only the photons with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into the branch line optical fiber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the transmitter node <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can freely select one of the receiver nodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by controlling the wavelength of the single photon to be transmitted, and communicates with the selected receiver node in accordance with the conventional quantum key distribution protocol. Thus, a secret key of a common key cryptogram can be shared between the transmitter node and the selected receiver node on the multi-node network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, the quantum cryptography multi-node network system according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in the quantum cryptography multi-node network system, a node <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a node <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a node <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and a node <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are arranged in this order on a main communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The multi-node network system is comprised of a 1-input and 2-output passive optical combiner (AWG) which is connected with the main communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to transmit an optical signal with the wavelengths of &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the node <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the nodes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on the main communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. A 1-input and 2-output optical splitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passive splits an optical signal with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the optical signal on the main communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to output to the node <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and outputs the optical signal with the wavelengths of &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the main communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The 1-input and 2-output optical passive splitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> splits an optical signal with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the optical signal with the wavelengths of &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the main communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to output to the node <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and outputs the optical signal with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the main communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A method of delivering a quantum cryptographic key will be described, using a case of transmission of a quantum cryptographic key from the node <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the node <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the multi-node network system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The node <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> applies quantum states to photons with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order of the quantum states distributed through a classical communication and outputs the photons to the main communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as an optical signal. In case of 4 quantum states, the quantum states are, for example, base state <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of each polarization state of 0 degrees and 90 degrees, and base state <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of each polarization state of 45 degrees and 135 degrees. With the outputted photons with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the optical passive splitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> outputs only the photons with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the main communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and the optical passive splitter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> outputs the photon with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> the node <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In this case, only one communication route from the node <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the node <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be selected for the photons with the wavelength of &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if photons are intercepted by an interception node on the way of the communication route, an interception node returns the photons with the quantum state different from the initial state in the probability of 1/2 to the communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, because the interception node does not know the quantum state of the photon. Thus, the true receiver node can know the interception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the method of distributing the quantum cryptographic key from the node <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is described. However, the quantum cryptographic key can be distributed from the node <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to an optional one of the nodes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the node <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can deliver the quantum cryptographic key to the nodes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> at a same time, by applying the same quantum state to the photons with the wavelengths of &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in order of the quantum states of the photons distributed through the classical communication and by delivering the photons to the main communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. In this case, only one communication route can be selected to each of the photons with the wavelengths of &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, if any interception is carried out on the way of the communication route, the interception node returns the photon to the communication channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the quantum state of the photon different from the initial state in the probability of 1/2, because the interception node does not know the quantum state of the photon. Therefore, the true receiver node can know whether the interception is carried out. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the structure of the quantum cryptography decoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The quantum cryptography decoder is comprised of a quantum measurement order storing section <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, a quantum state measuring section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and a measurement result storing section <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The quantum measurement order storing section <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> stores an order of the quantum states (base states <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) set by a receiver node. The quantum state measuring section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> receives the light signal on the quantum communication channel through a receiving section <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and measures the quantum state (polarization state) of an inputted photon by switching a detecting section (not shown) for detecting the polarization state of the photon based on the base state. The detecting section is a measuring section for measuring 0-degree polarization or 90-degree polarization in case of the base state <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The measurement result storing section <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> stores the measured polarization state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> After the distribution of the quantum cryptographic key from the transmitter node to the receiver node is completed, the order of the quantum states (the base states) of the quantum cryptographic key is delivered from the transmitter node to the receiver node. The receiver node receives the delivered quantum states (the base states) of the quantum cryptographic key and stores the order in a quantum state order storing section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A comparing section <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> compares the order of the base states previously determined in case of the reception, i.e., the order stored in the quantum measurement order storing section <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and the quantum states (the base states) delivered from the transmitter node. The comparing section <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> stored the quantum states which are coincident with each other in the quantum state order storing section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and discards the quantum states which are not coincident with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Next, a comparing section <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> compares the polarization states stored in the quantum state order storing section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the polarization states stored in a measurement result storing section <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. A determining section <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> determines the presence or absence of interception based on the comparing result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Generally, when the discrepancy is equal to or less than 15%, the interception supposes to be not carried out. It should be noted that there is a determination method in which only a first half is used when the first half is coincident with each other but the second half is not coincident, in addition to a full coincidence method. Therefore, the method of the present invention can share a secret key of the common key cryptogram between the two nodes on the multi-node network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, a case is described in which the asymmetrical waveguide interference system is used as a method of the light communication channel switching. However, in place of the asymmetrical waveguide interference system, devices may be used such as a light micro-electromechanical system (MEMS), a bubble switch, a heat/light switch, and a non-linear optical switch which utilizes micro-machine technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The multi-node network of the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments. The asymmetrical waveguide interference system may be not of a 1-input and 2-output type. It is possible to set all the nodes as transmitter nodes by devising the arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The quantum state cannot be kept when active elements such as a light amplifier are inserted into the communication channel. In the conventional quantum encryptation used photons, therefore, the communication using a private line was permissible only. For example, an optical loss in the optical fiber does not have an influence on the operation principle of the quantum cryptography essentially. This is because photons lost due to the optical loss cannot be detected by a detector and signal distortion due to the optical loss can be excluded surely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, various light communication channel switching techniques are developed in the light network technology in recent years. For example, the light communication channel switching techniques are shown in &ldquo;Optical Communication Which Breaks Electronics Communication (G. Stix)&rdquo;, (Nikkei Science, 2001, April, p. 24) which corresponds to &ldquo;THE TRIUMPH OF THE LIGHT (SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN January 2001), &ldquo;Optical Switching Technology Which Advance to Practical Use (David. J. Bishop et al.)&rdquo;, which corresponds to &rdquo;THE RISE OF OPTICAL SWITCHING (SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN January 2001), (Nikkei Science, 2001, April, p. 32), and &ldquo;Last Hurdle-Optical Packet Communication (Daniel J. Blumenthal)&rdquo;(Nikkei Science, 2001, April, p. 40), which corresponds to &ldquo;routing packets with light (SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN January 2001)&rdquo;. The light communication channel switching is realized without using active optical device in most of these papers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> For example, an optical signal multiplexing apparatus and an optical signal demultiplexing apparatus which use an asymmetrical wave guide interference system (AWG) use only the interference effect of light without using any active optical process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, if these asymmetrical light waveguide interference systems are used as the optical signal multiplexing apparatus in a transmitter node and the optical signal demultiplexing apparatus in a receiver node, a plurality of quantum communication channels can be multiplexed on a single optical fiber. Moreover, the light communication channel switching can be carried out from the transmitter node to a desired one of the receiver node nodes by selecting the wavelength of the photon by the transmitter node node. In this way, the quantum key can be distributed between optional two of the nodes on the multi-node network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, the secret key of the common key cryptogram can be safely shared unconditionally between optional two of the nodes in the multi-node network. </paragraph>
