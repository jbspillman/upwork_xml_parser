<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention is directed to a method of removing oxygenated contaminants from an olefin stream. In particular, this invention is directed to an method of removing dimethyl ether from an olefin stream. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, are desirable as a feed source for making derivative products such as oligomers, e.g., higher olefins, and polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. Olefin feed sources have traditionally been produced by cracking petroleum feedstocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,090,977 discloses a method of making olefins by steam cracking. The method includes separating the olefin product into methane, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, propylene and C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>&plus; streams. The disclosed separation preferentially produces propylene, and no propane, butane, butene, or butadiene streams are produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Oxygenate feed stocks, however, are becoming an alternative to petroleum feed stocks for making olefins, particularly large quantities of ethylene and propylene for the production of higher olefins and plastic materials. In general, the olefins are formed by contacting the oxygenate components with a molecular sieve catalyst to catalytically convert the oxygenates to olefins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,499,327, discloses a process for making olefins from methanol using any of a variety of silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) molecular sieve catalysts. The process is carried out at a temperature between 300&deg; C. and 500&deg; C., a pressure between 0.1 atmosphere to 100 atmospheres, and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of between 0.1 and 40 hr<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The process is highly selective for making ethylene and propylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,121,504 also discloses a method of making olefin product from oxygenate feed using molecular sieve catalysts. Water and other unwanted by-products are removed from the olefin product by contacting with a quench medium. After contacting with the quench medium, a light product fraction is obtained which comprises the desired olefins, but also includes dimethyl ether, methane, CO, CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, ethane, propane, and other minor components such as water and unreacted oxygenate feedstock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to further process olefins, it is often necessary to reduce or remove the amount of undesirable hydrocarbon by-products that are present in the olefin composition. This is because derivative manufacturing processes may use catalysts that are quite sensitive to the presence of certain hydrocarbons. For example, dimethyl ether has been found to act as a poison to certain catalysts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,647 discloses that dimethyl ether can adversely impact the oligomerization of certain olefins. The patent describes a process for removing dimethyl ether from a C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and/or C<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>olefin stream using distillation. The stream is distilled and separated into an overhead and a bottoms stream. The overhead stream contains dimethyl ether, water, and various hydrocarbons, and the bottoms stream contains purified olefins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,609,734 discloses a method of removing methanol and dimethyl ether from a mixed hydrocarbon stream. The hydrocarbon stream containing the methanol and dimethyl ether is distilled such that the dimethyl ether and methanol are removed in an overhead stream. Additional methanol is recovered in a side stream, in which a methanol permeable membrane is used to obtain the additional separation. Purified hydrocarbon is removed from an bottoms stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,387,263 discloses a method of making olefins from methanol using a zeolite catalyst. The methanol is contacted with the catalyst in a reactor to form an olefin product containing C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>olefins, water, unreacted methanol, and dimethyl ether, which is considered an intermediate product. The C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>olefins are separated from the water, unreacted methanol and dimethyl ether. The unreacted methanol and the dimethyl ether are then stripped from the water, and recycled to the reactor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,603,225 discloses a method of making methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) by reacting isobutylene with methanol in the presence of a catalyst. The MTBE is recovered by distillation, which also produces a raffinate stream. The raffinate stream contains unreacted olefins and methanol, water, and dimethyl ether. The dimethyl ether is washed from the raffinate stream using a methanol and water wash. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Removal of dimethyl ether from olefin streams is particularly difficult, since very low levels of dimethyl ether can act as catalyst poisons. This means olefin streams such as ethylene and propylene should contain little if any dimethyl ether, if further catalytic processing of the olefin stream is desired. Therefore, it is highly desirable to find additional methods of removing dimethyl ether from olefin streams. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a method for removing oxygenated contaminants such as dimethyl ether from an olefin stream. It is desirable to remove such oxygenated components, since they may poison catalysts that are used to further process such olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention provides, in one embodiment, a method of separating dimethyl ether from an olefin stream. The method comprises separating the olefin stream into a first stream comprising dimethyl ether and lighter boiling point olefin compounds, and a second stream comprising C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point hydrocarbons. The dimethyl ether present in the first stream is then separated using extractive distillation. Desirably, the olefin stream is separated into the first and second streams using distillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the first stream comprises ethylene, and the ethylene is separated from the overhead stream prior to separating the dimethyl ether using the extractive distillation. Desirably, the extractive distillation is carried out in a column having a rectification zone and a stripping zone. In one preferred embodiment, the extractive distillation column has a feed location for introducing the olefin stream into the column such that the rectification zone is above the feed location and the stripping zone is below the feed location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is desirable in the invention that the extractive distillation uses a polar extractant having an average boiling point of at least 100&deg; F. (38&deg; C.) at 1 atm. In general, it is also desirable that the first stream comprises not greater than about 5 wt % C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point hydrocarbons, and the second stream comprises at least about 60 wt % C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point hydrocarbons. </paragraph>

The olefin stream is separated into a first stream comprising the ethylene, propylene and dimethyl ether and a second stream comprising the C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point hydrocarbons. The dimethyl ether present in the first stream is then separated using extractive distillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a method of removing dimethyl ether from an olefin stream made from an oxygenate to olefin reaction process, which comprises contacting the oxygenate with a molecular sieve catalyst to form an olefin stream, wherein the olefin stream comprises ethylene, propylene, dimethyl ether and C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point hydrocarbons. The olefin stream is separated into a first stream comprising the ethylene, propylene and dimethyl ether and a second stream comprising the C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point hydrocarbons. The dimethyl ether present in the first stream is then separated using extractive distillation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Olefins are typically used as feedstreams for forming a variety of end products. One example is ethylene and propylene, which can be used, inter alia, to make plastic materials such as polyethylene and polypropylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Often, olefin streams that are to be used as feedstreams for further processing contain contaminants. An example of one type of contaminant is oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds. There compounds are hydrocarbons that contain at least one oxygen atom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Many oxygenated hydrocarbon contaminants that are found in olefin streams are water soluble, and can, therefore, be removed using a water washing system. However, some oxygenated hydrocarbon contaminants are not very water soluble, and will not be removed using water alone. One such example is dimethyl ether. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this invention, dimethyl ether is removed from an olefin stream by first separating the olefin stream into one or a first stream comprising dimethyl ether and lighter boiling point compounds, and a second stream comprising C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point hydrocarbons. Separation into such streams can be by any means. Distillation is one example. The dimethyl ether is then separated from the first stream by extractive distillation, which is essentially a distillation process that incorporates the use of an extractant to aid in the distillation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The olefin streams from which the dimethyl ether is removed according to this invention, can be provided from any source. For example, the olefins can come from by the cracking of hydrocarbons, such as ethane, propane, butane, naphtha and gas oil, dehydrogenation of paraffins, metathesis reactions of other olefins, catalytic cracking and deep catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although the olefin stream can be provided by any conventional source which contains dimethyl ether, the invention is particularly suited to removing dimethyl ether from olefin streams made from an oxygenate to olefin process. In one embodiment of this invention, an olefin stream containing dimethyl ether is obtained by contacting oxygenate feedstock with a molecular sieve catalyst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the oxygenate feedstock contains one or more oxygenates, more specifically, one or more organic compound(s) containing at least one oxygen atom. In the most preferred embodiment of the process of invention, the oxygenate in the feedstock is one or more alcohol(s), preferably aliphatic alcohol(s) where the aliphatic moiety of the alcohol(s) has from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and most preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The alcohols useful as feedstock in the process of the invention include lower straight and branched chain aliphatic alcohols and their unsaturated counterparts. Non-limiting examples of oxygenates include methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, methyl ethyl ether, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, di-isopropyl ether, formaldehyde, dimethyl carbonate, dimethyl ketone, acetic acid, and mixtures thereof. In the most preferred embodiment, the feedstock is selected from one or more of methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether or a combination thereof, more preferably methanol and dimethyl ether, and most preferably methanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The feedstock, in one embodiment, contains one or more diluent(s), typically used to reduce the concentration of the feedstock, and are generally non-reactive to the feedstock or molecular sieve catalyst composition. Non-limiting examples of diluents include helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, essentially non-reactive paraffins (especially alkanes such as methane, ethane, and propane), essentially non-reactive aromatic compounds, and mixtures thereof. The most preferred diluents are water and nitrogen, with water being particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The diluent is either added directly to a feedstock entering into a reactor or added directly into a reactor, or added with a molecular sieve catalyst composition. In one embodiment, the amount of diluent in the feedstock is in the range of from about 1 to about 99 mole percent based on the total number of moles of the feedstock and diluent, preferably from about 1 to 80 mole percent, more preferably from about 5 to about 50, most preferably from about 5 to about 25. In one embodiment, other hydrocarbons are added to a feedstock either directly or indirectly, and include olefin(s), paraffin(s), aromatic(s) (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,677,242, addition of aromatics) or mixtures thereof, preferably propylene, butylene, pentylene, and other hydrocarbons having 4 or more carbon atoms, or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Molecular sieves capable of converting an oxygenate to an olefin compound include zeolite as well as non-zeolite molecular sieves, and are of the large, medium or small pore type. Non-limiting examples of these molecular sieves are the small pore molecular sieves, AEI, AFT, APC, ATN, ATT, ATV, AWW, BIK, CAS, CHA, CHI, DAC, DDR, EDI, ERI, GOO, KFI, LEV, LOV, LTA, MON, PAU, PHI, RHO, ROG, THO, and substituted forms thereof; the medium pore molecular sieves, AFO, AEL, EUO, HEU, FER, MEL, MFI, MTW, MTT, TON, and substituted forms thereof; and the large pore molecular sieves, EMT, FAU, and substituted forms thereof. Other molecular sieves include ANA, BEA, CFI, CLO, DON, GIS, LTL, MER, MOR, MWW and SOD. Non-limiting examples of the preferred molecular sieves, particularly for converting an oxygenate containing feedstock into olefin(s), include AEL, AFY, BEA, CHA, EDI, FAU, FER, GIS, LTA, LTL, MER, MFI, MOR, MTT, MWW, TAM and TON. In one preferred embodiment, the molecular sieve of the invention has an AEI topology or a CHA topology, or a combination thereof, most preferably a CHA topology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Molecular sieve materials all have 3-dimensional, four-connected framework structure of corner-sharing TO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra, where T is any tetrahedrally coordinated cation. These molecular sieves are typically described in terms of the size of the ring that defines a pore, where the size is based on the number of T atoms in the ring. Other framework-type characteristics include the arrangement of rings that form a cage, and when present, the dimension of channels, and the spaces between the cages. See van Bekkum, et al., <highlight><italic>Introduction to Zeolite Science and Practice, Second Completely Revised and Expanded Edition</italic></highlight>, Volume 137, pages 1-67, Elsevier Science, B. V., Amsterdam, Netherlands (2001). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The small, medium and large pore molecular sieves have from a 4-ring to a 12-ring or greater framework-type. In a preferred embodiment, the molecular sieves have 8-, 10- or 12-ring structures or larger and an average pore size in the range of from about 3 &angst; to 15 &angst;. In the most preferred embodiment, the molecular sieves of the invention, preferably silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves, have 8-rings and an average pore size less than about 5 &angst;, preferably in the range of from 3 &angst; to about 5 &angst;, more preferably from 3 &angst; to about 4.5 &angst;, and most preferably from 3.5 &angst; to about 4.2 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Molecular sieves, particularly zeolitic and zeolitic-type molecular sieves, preferably have a molecular framework of one, preferably two or more corner-sharing &lsqb;TO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rsqb; tetrahedral units, more preferably, two or more &lsqb;SiO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;, &lsqb;AlO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rsqb; and/or &lsqb;PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rsqb; tetrahedral units, and most preferably &lsqb;SiO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;, &lsqb;AlO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rsqb; and &lsqb;PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rsqb; tetrahedral units. These silicon, aluminum, and phosphorous based molecular sieves and metal containing silicon, aluminum and phosphorous based molecular sieves have been described in detail in numerous publications including for example, U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The molecular sieves are made or formulated into catalysts by combining the synthesized molecular sieves with a binder and/or a matrix material to form a molecular sieve catalyst composition or a formulated molecular sieve catalyst composition. This formulated molecular sieve catalyst composition is formed into useful shape and sized particles by conventional techniques such as spray drying, pelletizing, extrusion, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> There are many different binders that are useful in forming the molecular sieve catalyst composition. Non-limiting examples of binders that are useful alone or in combination include various types of hydrated alumina, silicas, and/or other inorganic oxide sol. One preferred alumina containing sol is aluminum chlorhydrol. The inorganic oxide sol acts like glue binding the synthesized molecular sieves and other materials such as the matrix together, particularly after thermal treatment. Upon heating, the inorganic oxide sol, preferably having a low viscosity, is converted into an inorganic oxide matrix component. For example, an alumina sol will convert to an aluminum oxide matrix following heat treatment. </paragraph>

M. Wolterman, et al., Stud. Surf. Sci. and Catal., 76, pages 105-144 (1993), which is herein incorporated by reference. In another embodiment, one or more binders are combined with one or more other non-limiting examples of alumina materials such as aluminum oxyhydroxide, &ggr;-alumina, boehmite, diaspore, and transitional aluminas such as &agr;-alumina, &bgr;-alumina, &ggr;-alumina, &dgr;-alumina, &egr;-alumina, &kgr;-alumina, and &rgr;-alumina, aluminum trihydroxide, such as gibbsite, bayerite, nordstrandite, doyelite, and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the binders are alumina sols, predominantly comprising aluminum oxide, optionally including some silicon.

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The molecular sieve, in a preferred embodiment, is combined with one or more matrix material(s). Matrix materials are typically effective in reducing overall catalyst cost, act as thermal sinks assisting in shielding heat from the catalyst composition for example during regeneration, densifying the catalyst composition, increasing catalyst strength such as crush strength and attrition resistance, and to control the rate of conversion in a particular process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Non-limiting examples of matrix materials include one or more of: rare earth metals, metal oxides including titania, zirconia, magnesia, thoria, beryllia, quartz, silica or sols, and mixtures thereof, for example silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia, silica-titania, silica-alumina and silica-alumina-thoria. In an embodiment, matrix materials are natural clays such as those from the families of montmorillonite and kaolin. These natural clays include sabbentonites and those kaolins known as, for example, Dixie, McNamee, Georgia and Florida clays. Non-limiting examples of other matrix materials include: haloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite, or anauxite.

It has been found that a higher sieve content, lower matrix content, increases the molecular sieve catalyst composition performance, however, lower sieve content, higher matrix material, improves the attrition resistance of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the formulated molecular sieve catalyst composition contains from about 1% to about 99%, more preferably from about 5% to about 90%, and most preferably from about 10% to about 80%, by weight of the molecular sieve based on the total weight of the molecular sieve catalyst composition. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Once the molecular sieve catalyst composition is formed in a substantially dry or dried state, to further harden and/or activate the formed catalyst composition, a heat treatment such as calcination, at an elevated temperature is usually performed. A conventional calcination environment is air that typically includes a small amount of water vapor. Typical calcination temperatures are in the range from about 400&deg; C. to about 1,000&deg; C., preferably from about 500&deg; C. to about 800&deg; C., and most preferably from about 550&deg; C. to about 700&deg; C., preferably in a calcination environment such as air, nitrogen, helium, flue gas (combustion product lean in oxygen), or any combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The process for converting a feedstock, especially a feedstock containing one or more oxygenates, in the presence of a molecular sieve catalyst composition of the invention, is carried out in a reaction process in a reactor, where the process is a fixed bed process, a fluidized bed process (includes a turbulent bed process), preferably a continuous fluidized bed process, and most preferably a continuous high velocity fluidized bed process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The reaction processes can take place in a variety of catalytic reactors such as hybrid reactors that have a dense bed or fixed bed reaction zones and/or fast fluidized bed reaction zones coupled together, circulating fluidized bed reactors, riser reactors, and the like. Suitable conventional reactor types are described in for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,796, U.S. Pat.

The liquid and vapor feedstocks are preferably the same composition, or contain varying proportions of the same or different feedstock with the same or different diluent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The feedstock entering the reactor system is preferably converted, partially or fully, in the first reactor zone into a gaseous effluent that enters the disengaging vessel along with a coked molecular sieve catalyst composition. In the preferred embodiment, cyclone(s) within the disengaging vessel are designed to separate the molecular sieve catalyst composition, preferably a coked molecular sieve catalyst composition, from the gaseous effluent containing one or more olefin(s) within the disengaging zone. Cyclones are preferred, however, gravity effects within the disengaging vessel will also separate the catalyst compositions from the gaseous effluent. Other methods for separating the catalyst compositions from the gaseous effluent include the use of plates, caps, elbows, and the like. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Other processes for converting an oxygenate such as methanol to one or more olefin(s) using a molecular sieve catalyst composition are described in PCT WO 01/23500 published Apr. 5, 2001 (propane reduction at an average catalyst feedstock exposure of at least 1.0), which is herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the conversion of the primary oxygenate, e.g., methanol, is from 90 wt % to 98 wt %. According to another embodiment the conversion of methanol is from 92 wt % to 98 wt %, preferably from 94 wt % to 98 wt %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment, the conversion of methanol is above 98 wt % to less than 100 wt %. According to another embodiment, the conversion of methanol is from 98.1 wt % to less than 100 wt %; preferably from 98.2 wt % to 99.8 wt %. According to another embodiment, the conversion of methanol is from 98.2 wt % to less than 99.5 wt %; preferably from 98.2 wt % to 99 wt %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The oxygenate to olefin process forms a substantial amount of water as a by-product. Much of this water can be removed by cooling the olefin stream from the oxygenate reactor to a temperature below the condensation temperature of the water in the stream. Preferably, the temperature of the product stream is cooled to a temperature below the condensation temperature of the oxygenate feed for the oxygenate to olefins process. In certain embodiments, it is desirable to cool the product stream below the condensation temperature of methanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A quench column is one type of equipment that is effective in cooling the olefin stream from the olefin to oxygenate reaction process. In a quench column, a quenching fluid is directly contacted with the olefin stream to cool the stream to the desired condensation temperature. Condensation produces the condensed water containing stream, which is also referred to as a heavy bottoms stream. The olefin portion of the olefin product stream remains a vapor, and exits the quench column as an overhead vapor stream. The overhead vapor stream is rich in olefin product, and can also contain some oxygenated hydrocarbon by-products as well as water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the quenching fluid is a recycle stream of the condensed water containing, heavy bottoms stream of the quench column. This water containing stream is desirably cooled, e.g., by a heat exchanger, and injected back into the quench column. It is preferred in this embodiment to not inject cooling medium from an outside source into the quench column, although it may be desirable to do so in other separation equipment down stream of the quench column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In one particular embodiment of the invention, the quenched olefin stream is further processed by compression, preferably multi-staged compression. Two, three, four or more stages can be used, with two or three stages being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the olefin stream is compressed to a pressure that is greater than that at which the oxygenate to olefin reaction process is carried out. Preferably, the olefin stream is compressed to a pressure of at least about 30 psia (207 kPa), more preferably at least about 50 psia (345 kPa), most preferably at least about 100 psia (689 kPa). High pressure ranges are particularly preferred, with the upper limit being a practical one based on cost of design and ease of operation. Practical high pressure limits are generally considered to be up to about 1,000 psia (6,895 kPa), with lower limits of about 750 psia (5,171 kPa), about 500 psia (3,447 kPa), and about 400 psia (2,758 kPa) being increasingly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of this invention, the provided olefin stream from which the dimethyl ether is to be removed comprises not greater than about 15,000 wppm water so as to minimize clathrate and/or free water formation in the distillation column in which the olefin stream containing the dimethyl ether is separated from the C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point containing hydrocarbon stream. Preferably the provided olefin stream contains not greater than about 10,000 wppm water, more preferably not greater than 5,000 wppm water, and most preferably not greater than about 1,000 wppm water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It is not necessary in this invention that the provided olefin stream be completely dry. That is, the olefin stream can contain some water. The benefit of the olefin stream containing some amount of water is that additional and/or complex drying equipment will not be needed before separating the dimethyl ether containing stream from the C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point hydrocarbon containing stream. Preferably, the provided olefin stream contains at least about 10 wppm water, more preferably at least about 100 wppm water, and most preferably at least about 200 wppm water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the provided olefin stream from which the dimethyl ether is to be removed is low in methanol so as to make separation of the C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point hydrocarbons from the dimethyl ether containing stream easier. Desirably, the provided olefin stream contains not greater than about 5 wt % methanol. Preferably, the provided olefin stream contains not greater than about 2 wt % methanol, more preferably not greater than about 1 wt % methanol, most preferably not greater than about 0.5 wt % methanol. The methanol content can be controlled when the olefin stream is provided from an oxygenate to olefin process, for example, by appropriate adjustment of conversion and/or quenching conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In this invention, a C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point stream, which is comprised of a majority of 1-butene and higher boiling point compounds (such compounds including 1-butene and any hydrocarbon having a boiling point higher than that of 1-butene, including hydrocarbons having less than 4 carbons) is desirably separated from the provided olefin stream prior to removing the dimethyl ether. Any conventional separation process can be used. Distillation is preferred. In such a case, distillation temperature is controlled so that the dimethyl ether is removed in one stream along with lighter boiling point hydrocarbons, and the C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point compounds would be removed as a separate stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, a C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point steam is separated as a separate or second stream, and comprises at least about 50 wt % C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point compounds. Preferably, the C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point stream comprises at least about 60 wt % C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point compounds, more preferably at least about 70 wt % C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the second stream comprises not greater than about 30 wt % C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&minus; olefin and lighter boiling point components, C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&minus; olefin and lighter boiling point components being considered propylene and any hydrocarbon compound having a boiling point less than propylene. Preferably, the C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&minus; olefin and lighter boiling point stream comprises not greater than about 20 wt % C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&minus; and lighter boiling point compounds, more preferably not greater than about 15 wt % C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&minus; and lighter boiling point compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the dimethyl ether in the separated olefin stream is removed from the olefin portion of the stream using extractive distillation. The olefin stream containing the dimethyl ether can comprise predominantly ethylene and propylene, preferably at least about 50 wt % ethylene and propylene, more preferably at least about 60 wt % ethylene and propylene, and most preferably at least about 70 wt % ethylene and propylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment on the invention, the ethylene is separated from the olefin stream prior to extractive distillation. Such separation can be by any conventional means. Distillation is preferred. When ethylene is separated from the olefin stream prior to extractive distillation, the resulting olefin stream desirably contains at least about 70 wt % propylene, preferably at least about 80 wt % propylene, more preferably at least about 90 wt % propylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The olefin stream that contains the dimethyl ether that is to be removed by extractive distillation is low in C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point components to provide for easier removal of the dimethyl ether. In one embodiment of the invention, the olefin stream comprises not greater than about 5 wt % C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point components. Preferably, the olefin stream comprises not greater than about 2 wt % C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point components, more preferably not greater than about 1 wt % C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Oxygenate contaminants can be removed to very low quantities in an olefin stream using an extractive distillation process under the appropriate conditions and with an appropriate extractant. Extractive distillation differs from a wash or conventional distillation process in that olefin is distilled from the contaminant using an extractant to aid the distillation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Extractive distillation is typically carried out using a vessel or tower having internal packing or trays that creates a temperature difference from top to bottom of the tower. The upper portion of the tower is the cooler portion, and higher volatile components in the olefin exit from the top of the tower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The location of the feed point of the extractant relative to the hydrocarbon feed point in the extractive distillation column can be adjusted for optimal results. In one embodiment of the invention, however, the extractive distillation has a rectification and stripping zone. It a preferred embodiment, the rectification zone is located above the hydrocarbon feed location, which will aid in keeping methanol and dimethyl ether out of the overhead hydrocarbon product stream. In another preferred embodiment, the stripping zone is located below the hydrocarbon feed point, which will aid in keeping propane out of the bottoms stream which contains dimethyl ether and extractant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, extractive distillation is carried out at an overhead column pressure of at least about 120 psia (827 kPa). Preferably, extractive distillation is carried out at an overhead column pressure of at least about 150 psia (1034 kPa), more preferably at least about 175 psia (1026 kPa), and most preferably at least about 200 psia (1378 kPa). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to maintain higher top stage temperatures in the extractive distillation column to avoid clathrate or free water formation. The greater the content of the methanol in the top stage, however, the lower the temperature can be, since the presence of methanol will inhibit clathrate or free water formation. In one embodiment of the invention, the top stage temperature is at least about 10&deg; F. (&minus;12&deg; C.). Preferably, the top stage temperature is at least about 20&deg; F. (&minus;7&deg; C.), more preferably at least about 30&deg; F. (&minus;1&deg; C.), and most preferably at least about 40&deg; F. (4&deg; C.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> An extractant or solvent is added to the extractive distillation vessel or tower, preferably in a quantity to enhance or suppress the volatility of the oxygenate relative to the olefin. This makes it easier to distill the oxygenate from the olefin, resulting in removal of the oxygenate to very low levels. In one embodiment, the extractant is added to the extractive distillation vessel at a molar ratio of extractant to total hydrocarbon feed of from about 4:1 to about 1:1; preferably from about 3:1 to about 1.2:1; and more preferably from about 2.5:1 to about 1.5:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Extractants which can be used in this invention are liquids at 1 atm. These extactants also desirably have an average boiling point of at least 100&deg; F. (38&deg; C.), preferably at least 120&deg; F. (49&deg; C.), and more preferably at least 150&deg; F. (66&deg; C.), each boiling point stated at 1 atm. Average boiling point, as defined herein, takes into account the boiling point of each compound in the extractant on a weight average basis. For example, an extractant containing 90 wt. % of a compound having a boiling point of 100 degrees and 10 wt. % of a compound having a boiling point of 200 degrees would have an average boiling point of 110 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The extractants are also desirably polar compositions. Such compositions preferably contain compounds such as water, monohydric alcohols, polyhydric alcohols, or mixtures thereof. Preferred monohydric alcohols include ethanol and propanol. Preferred polyhydric alcohols include glycols. Preferred glycols include ethylene glycol and tri-ethylene glycol. It is desirable that the extractant contain at least about 75 wt. % water, monohydric alcohol, and or polyhydric alcohol, preferably at least about 85 wt. %, more preferably at least about 90 wt. %, and most preferably at least about 95 wt. %. Water is most preferred as the extractant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The extractive distillation vessel or column can be of conventional design. Examples include a packed distillation column and a column containing trays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The extractive distillation process is desirably operated at a pressure higher than the quench operating pressure. Preferably extractive distillation is carried out at an operating pressure of at least about 50 psi (345 kPa) higher than the quench, more preferably at least about 100 psi (689 kPa), and most preferably at least about 150 psi (1034 kPa) higher. Preferably, the extractive distillation process is carried out at a pressure of from about 100 psia (689 kPa) to about 5000 psia (34,474 kPa). More preferred operating ranges are from about 150 psia (1034 kPa) to about 4000 psia (27,579 kPa); about 200 psia (1379 kPa) to about 3000 psia (20,684 kPa); about 250 psia (1,724 kPa) to about 2500 psia (17,237 kPa); and about 300 psia (2,068 kPa) to about 2000 psia (13,790 kPa). As the pressure in the extractive distillation vessel increases, the more oxygenate, particularly dimethyl ether, is removed from the olefin stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The extractive distillation process is particularly effective for removing very low concentrations of dimethyl ether present in an olefin stream. It is a very efficient process for removing dimethyl ether from an olefin stream which contains not greater than 20 wt. % dimethyl ether. Extractive distillation carried out according to this invention is even effective with olefin streams containing not greater than 10 wt. %, 5 wt. %, 1 wt. %, 0.5 wt. % or 0.1 wt. % dimethyl ether. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, extractant is added to the top of an extractive distillation column, and is removed as a lower or bottoms product from the bottom of the extractive distillation column. The extractive distillation column is desirably operated below the boiling point of the extractant, and above the boiling point of the product effluent at the operating pressure of the distillation column. As the extractant travels down the distillation column, dimethyl ether is absorbed into the extractant, and removed along with the extractant as a liquid bottoms product from the extractive distillation column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The extractive distillation process of this invention allows for the recovery of an olefin product having very low dimethyl ether levels. The total dimethyl ether content of the ethylene and/or propylene product streams, particularly an olefin stream containing at least 50 wt. % ethylene and/or propylene is generally not greater than about 5000 wt. ppm dimethyl ether. Ethylene and/or propylene streams containing not greater than about 3000 wt. ppm, 2000 wt. ppm, 1000 wt. ppm, 500 wt. ppm, 250 wt. ppm, 100 wt. ppm, 50 wt. ppm, 10 wt. ppm and 5 wt. ppm dimethyl ether are also readily achievable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> At least a majority (i.e., 50%) of the dimethyl ether entering the extractive distillation column is recovered in the lower or bottoms stream of the extractive distillation column which contains the extractant. Preferably, at least about 75%; more preferably, at least about 85%; and most preferably, at least about 95% of the dimethyl ether entering the extractive distillation column is recovered along with the extractant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The dimethyl ether contained in the extractant leaving the extractive distillation column can be recovered and used after a regeneration process. Regeneration of the extractant can be accomplished by conventional means. Preferably, the extractant is regenerated by separating the extractant from absorbed compounds in a distillation column. Preferably, an extractant that has a boiling point temperature at least about 5&deg; F. (3&deg; C.), more preferably at least about 10&deg; F. (6&deg; C.) higher, than the absorbed compounds is used in the extractive distillation column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The bottoms product from the extractive distillation column is fed into the distillation column for regeneration. The distillation column produces an overhead stream comprising oxygenates and hydrocarbons that were absorbed by the extractant in the extractive distillation column. The bottoms product from the distillation column is regenerated extractant that can be returned to the extractive distillation column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the extractant is cooled before being returned to the top of the extractive distillation column. Cooling the extractant below the temperature of the extractive distillation column&apos;s overhead product stream aids the efficiency of the column. In an extractive distillation column using water as the extractant, preferably the temperature of the extractant is cooled to below about 95&deg; F. (35&deg; C.), and more preferably the extractant is cooled to below about 90&deg; F. (32&deg; C.), before being returned to the extractive distillation column. The extractant can be cooled by conventional means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> If methanol is used as the extractant, the dimethyl ether containing extractant can be combined with an oxygenate stream that is used to feed an oxygenate to olefins reaction system. The dimethyl ether and the methanol will readily react with the catalyst in such a system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The ethylene and propylene streams treated and separated according to this invention can be polymerized to form plastic compositions, e.g., polyolefins, particularly polyethylene and polypropylene. Any conventional process for forming polyethylene or polypropylene can be used. Catalytic processes are preferred. Particularly preferred are metallocene, Ziegler/Natta, aluminum oxide and acid catalytic systems. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,258,455; 3,305,538; 3,364,190; 5,892,079; 4,659,685; 4,076,698; 3,645,992; 4,302,565; and 4,243,691, the catalyst and process descriptions of each being expressly incorporated herein by reference. In general, these methods involve contacting the ethylene or propylene product with a polyolefin-forming catalyst at a pressure and temperature effective to form the polyolefin product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of this invention, the ethylene or propylene product is contacted with a metallocene catalyst to form a polyolefin. Desirably, the polyolefin forming process is carried out at a temperature ranging between about 50&deg; C. and about 320&deg; C. The reaction can be carried out at low, medium or high pressure, being anywhere within the range of about 1 bar to about 3200 bar. For processes carried out in solution, an inert diluent can be used. In this type of operation, it is desirable that the pressure be at a range of from about 10 bar to about 150 bar, and preferably at a temperature range of from about 120&deg; C. to about 250&deg; C. For gas phase processes, it is preferred that the temperature generally be within a range of about 60&deg; C. to 120&deg; C., and that the operating pressure be from about 5 bar to about 50 bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In addition to polyolefins, numerous other olefin derivatives may be formed from the ethylene, propylene and C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin compounds, particularly the butenes in the C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point stream separated according to this invention. The olefins separated according to this invention can also be used in the manufacture of such compounds as aldehydes, acids such as C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>mono carboxylic acids, alcohols such as C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>mono alcohols, esters made from the C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>mono carboxylic acids and the C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>mono alcohols, linear alpha olefins, vinyl acetate, ethylene dicholoride and vinyl chloride, ethylbenzene, ethylene oxide, cumene, acrolein, allyl chloride, propylene oxide, acrylic acid, ethylene-propylene rubbers, and acrylonitrile, and trimers and dimers of ethylene and propylene. The C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefins, butenes in particular, are particularly suited for the manufacture of aldehydes, acids, alcohols, esters made from C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>mono carboxylic acids and C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>mono alcohols and linear alpha olefins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Examples of separating dimethyl ether from olefin streams are shown in the Figures. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, oxygenate is sent through a line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to an oxygeante to olefin reaction system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The olefin reaction system includes an oxygenate to olefin reactor which converts the oxygenate to olefin, and a quench and compression system which removes a significant portion of the water by-product formed in the oxygenate to olefin reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Olefin from the olefin reaction system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sent through a line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a distillation process <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> where C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefins and higher boiling point components are separated from the olefin. The C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefins and higher boiling point components leave the distillation process as a bottoms stream though a line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and light olefins (i.e., C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>olefins), with little if any remaining C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefins and higher boiling point components, leave the distillation process <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as an overhead stream through a line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to an extractive distillation column <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The extractive distillation column has a rectification zone <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> above the hydrocarbon feed location, and a stripping zone <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> located below the hydrocarbon feed point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> An extractant is fed to the top portion of the extractive distillation column <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to extract dimethyl ether contained in the olefin overhead stream from line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The dimethyl ether and extractant leave the extractive distillation column through a bottoms line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A portion of the material in the bottoms line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is heated using a heating system, e.g., heat exchanger, (not shown) and recycled back to the extractive distillation column <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&minus; olefin and lighter boiling point hydrocarbon containing stream leaves the extractive distillation column <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as an overhead stream through a line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&minus; olefin and lighter boiling point hydrocarbon containing stream is subsequently separated into ethylene and propylene streams, and contains substantially no dimethyl ether. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Another example of separating dimethyl ether is shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an olefin stream is sent through a line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to a fractionation system <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The fractionation system <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> separates a C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus; olefin and lighter boiling point hydrocarbon containing stream and a C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus; olefin and higher boiling point stream from the olefin stream, leaving dimethyl ether in a C<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>stream in line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which contains a substantial portion of propylene, along with propane. The olefin stream comprising the dimethyl ether is sent through a line to a separator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, where propylene is separated as an overhead stream, and leaves the separator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> through a line <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A bottoms stream leaves the separator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> through a line <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>.
