<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a passive entry having an anti-theft function, and more particularly to a passive entry having an anti-theft function for preventing damage of relay attack by use of plural repeaters so that elapsed time from transmission of a request signal to a car-mounted transmitter-receiver to reception of an answer signal is counted, and only when the counted time value is within a valid elapsed-time value, a car door is locked or unlocked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, a passive entry used with a car comprises a transmitter-receiver mounted in the car and one or more portable transmitter-receivers for performing bidirectional signal transmission with the car-mounted transmitter-receiver. In the passive entry, during bidirectional signal transmission, the car-mounted transmitter-receiver transmits a request signal by a low frequency carrier signal, and if, at a transmission timing of the request signal, the portable transmitter-receivers exist in the proximity of the car, that is, within a reach range of the low frequency carrier signal, the portable transmitter-receivers receive the request signal. At this time, the portable transmitter-receivers transmit an answer signal by a high frequency carrier signal in response to the received request signal, and when the car-mounted transmitter-receiver receives the answer signal, an apparatus mounted in the car, e.g., a door is automatically locked or unlocked by the car-mounted transmitter-receiver. That is, upon receiving a legal answer signal when the door is locked, the car-mounted transmitter-receiver automatically unlocks the door, and on the other hand, upon receiving a legal answer signal when the door is unlocked, it automatically locks the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the passive entry having such a function, when a person carrying a portable transmitter-receiver approaches a car, a car door can be automatically unlocked without having to operate the portable transmitter-receiver; on the other hand, when the person carrying the portable transmitter-receiver moves away from the car, the car door can be automatically locked without having to operate the portable transmitter-receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the existing passive entry, when unlocking the car door, the person carrying the portable transmitter-receiver has only to approach the car, and on the other hand, when locking the car door, the person carrying the portable transmitter-receiver has only to move away from the car. Therefore, the person takes no trouble to lock or unlock the car door by a key in hand or by operating the operation keys of the portable transmitter-receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the existing passive entry, when unlocking the car door, the person carrying the portable transmitter-receiver must approach the car. However, if repeaters are used to relay a low frequency carrier signal for transmitting a request signal and a high frequency carrier signal for transmitting an answer signal, the car door can be unlocked even if the person carrying the portable transmitter-receiver does not approach the car. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram for explaining a state in which bidirectional communication is possible between a car-mounted transmitter-receiver and a portable transmitter-receiver if two repeaters are used when the portable transmitter-receiver is distant from a car. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, since the owner (not provided with a reference numeral) of a car <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> having a portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is considerably distant from the car <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is placed outside a reach range E<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>of a request signal from a car-mounted transmitter-receiver (not provided with a reference numeral) mounted on the car <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, since the car-mounted transmitter-receiver is placed outside a reach range of an answer signal from the portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, communication between the car-mounted transmitter-receiver and the portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is impossible in this state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> first repeater <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and a second repeater <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>intervene between the car-mounted transmitter-receiver (not provided with a reference numeral) mounted in the car <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> distant from the car so that a request signal and an answer signal can be transmitted between the car-mounted transmitter-receiver and the portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The first repeater <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is placed within a reach range E<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>of a low frequency carrier signal (request signal) transmitted by the car-mounted transmitter-receiver and the second relay <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is placed within a reach range E<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>of a low frequency carrier signal (request signal) transmitted by the portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Upon receiving the low frequency carrier signal (request signal) from the car-mounted transmitter-receiver, the first repeater <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>converts the low frequency carrier signal to a high frequency carrier signal to transmit the request signal to the second repeater <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Upon receiving the request signal transmitted by the high frequency carrier signal, the second repeater <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>converts the high frequency carrier signal to a low frequency carrier signal and transmits the request signal to the portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by the low frequency carrier signal so that the request signal is transmitted to the portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, upon receiving a high frequency carrier signal (answer signal) from the portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the second repeater <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>amplifies the received high frequency carrier signal and then transmits the answer signal to the first repeater <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>by the high frequency carrier signal. Upon receiving the answer signal transmitted by the high frequency carrier signal, the first repeater <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>amplifies the received high frequency carrier signal and then transmits the answer signal to the car-mounted transmitter-receiver by the high frequency carrier signal so that the answer signal is transmitted to the car-mounted transmitter-receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the existing passive entry, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, if the repeaters <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are used, since the reach range E<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>of the low frequency carrier signal (request signal), and in some cases, a reach range of the high frequency carrier signal (answer signal) can be substantially expanded, the owner of the car <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> carrying the portable transmitter-receiver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can unlock a car door even if he is considerably distant from the car <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The above-described act is used to unlock a car door by malicious people without permission of a car owner and is called relay attack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The existing passive entry has the risk of a car door being unlocked using the repeaters <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>by malicious people, that is, undergoing relay attack. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in view of such a technical background and provides a passive entry having an anti-theft function for disabling operations on a car door that are performed at positions considerably distant from the car by use of repeaters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, the passive entry having the anti-theft function of the present invention comprises a car-mounted transmitter-receiver mounted in a car and one or more portable transmitter-receivers. In the passive entry, the car-mounted transmitter-receiver generates a request signal; upon receiving the request signal, any of the portable transmitter-receivers transmits an answer signal in response to the request signal; and upon receiving the answer signal, the car-mounted transmitter-receiver controls an apparatus mounted in the car, such as car door locking and unlocking. The car-mounted transmitter-receiver has a timer for counting time from transmission of the request signal to reception of the answer signal and has a means for recognizing the received answer signal as legal only when an elapsed-time value counted by the timer is within a valid elapsed-time value set in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described means, the car-mounted transmitter-receiver is provided with a timer for counting time from transmission of a request signal to reception of an answer signal, and only when an elapsed-time value counted by the timer is within a valid elapsed-time value set in advance when the answer signal is received, the received answer signal is recognized as a legal answer signal. In the case where repeaters intervene between the car-mounted transmitter-receiver and a portable transmitter-receiver, a counted elapsed time from the transmission of a request signal from the car-mounted transmitter-receiver, through reception of the request signal in a portable transmitter-receiver and transmission of an answer signal in response to the request signal from the portable transmitter-receiver, to reception of the answer signal in the car-mounted transmitter-receiver is not within a valid elapsed-time value set in advance because of delay of relay signals by the repeaters. Therefore, even if the car-mounted transmitter-receiver receives the answer signal, it judges the answer signal to be illegal and nullifies various functions to be subsequently executed, so that control of an apparatus mounted in the car such as car door locking and unlocking is not performed, and the car can be prevented from being stolen by relay attack.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a car-mounted transmitter-receiver is provided with a timer for counting time from transmission of a request signal to reception of an answer signal so that a car door is locked or unlocked only when an elapsed-time value counted by the timer is within a valid elapsed-time value set in advance when the answer signal is received. In the case where repeaters intervene between the car-mounted transmitter-receiver and a portable transmitter-receiver, a counted elapsed time from the transmission of a request signal from the car-mounted transmitter-receiver, through reception of the request signal in a portable transmitter-receiver and transmission of an answer signal in response to the request signal from the portable transmitter-receiver, to reception of the answer signal in the car-mounted transmitter-receiver is not within a valid elapsed-time value set in advance because of delay of relay signals by the repeaters. Therefore, even if the car-mounted transmitter-receiver receives the answer signal, it nullifies various functions to be subsequently executed, so that the car door is neither locked nor unlocked, providing the effect of preventing the car from being stolen by relay attack. </paragraph>
