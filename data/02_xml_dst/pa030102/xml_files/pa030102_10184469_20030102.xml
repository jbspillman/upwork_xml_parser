<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to metal-to-metal seals, and in particular to an improved gasket for sealing between a wellhead housing and a wellhead connector. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In oil and gas wellhead assemblies, tubular members are connected end-to-endand sealed by a gasket or seal ring. One type of seal ring, particularly used in subsea wellhead assemblies, is of metal and has upper and lower legs. A rib extends radially outward from a junction of the legs. Each leg has a conical sealing surface that engages a conical seat on one of the wellhead members. The conical sealing surface is a continuous cone that extends from the tip of the leg to the rib. The taper angle of the sealing surface is typically slightly different that the taper angle of the seat, creating an interference metal-to-metal sealing engagement. A coating, such as a silver alloy, may be applied to the sealing surface to enhance sealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This type of seal works well. However, improvements are desired in the ability of the seal to seal against high pressure gas over long periods of time. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The seal of this invention has two oppositely extending legs and a rib extending radially from the junction of the legs. A pair of sealing bands are located on at least one of the legs. The sealing bands are separated by an annular recess. One of the sealing bands extends from the tip of the leg to the recess. The other extends from the rib to the recess. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the bands are located in the same conical surface of revolution. The taper angle is slightly smaller relative to the axis of the seal ring, than the seat. This causes greater contact pressure in the sealing band located adjacent the tip than the one next to the rib. A coating of molybdenum sulfide is applied to the sealing bands in the preferred embodiment. The recess has tapered upper and lower edges, and in the preferred embodiment, has a concave base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Preferably, both legs are identical. However, one version of the seal has a contingent seal leg in the event the conical seat on the lower tubular member is damaged. The contingent seal leg has only a single sealing band, and it is located adjacent the tip and separated by as support section. The contingent seal band is at a much steeper angle, relative to the axis of the seal ring, than the two seal bands on the opposite leg. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, wellhead housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> terminating on its upper end in a rim with an upward facing shoulder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A conical primary seat or sealing surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extends downward and inward from shoulderl<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Primary seal surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has a lower marginal edge that joins a secondary seat or seal surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Secondary seal surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is preferably conical, also, but at a lesser angle relative to the axis of bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> than primary seal surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The lower marginal edge of secondary seal surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> joins a transition surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The axial extent of secondary seal surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is less than the axial extent of primary seal surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the preferred embodiment. Transition surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is a conical surface with a lower edge that joins bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A wellhead connector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> will connect to wellhead housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Wellhead connector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has a lower portion that slides over the exterior of wellhead housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Wellhead connector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has a locking member such as dogs (not shown) that are moved into engagement with grooves (not shown) formed on the exterior of wellhead housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Wellhead connector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has a bore <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> that is coaxial with bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A downward facing shoulder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of wellhead connector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> contacts and bears against shoulder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of wellhead housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is located radially inward from downward facing shoulder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> has an outer wall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is cylindrical and coaxial with wellhead connector bore <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. A conical seat or sealing surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> extends upward and inward from recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Conical surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> has an upper marginal edge that joins a transition shoulder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Transition shoulder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is perpendicular to the axis of bore <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A gasket or seal ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> locates between wellhead connector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and wellhead housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Seal ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is generally T-shaped, and in this embodiment has an upper end or leg <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a lower leg or end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that are symmetrical. Each portion has a first seal band <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> near one end and a second seal band <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> spaced from seal band <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> by a recess <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. A rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> extends radially outward on the exterior of seal ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> locates in recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, with the outer side of rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> located inward from recess outer wall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Each first seal band <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> extends from a tip of its seal leg <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> toward rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Each second seal band <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> extends from rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> toward the tip of its seal leg <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, recess <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is located midway between the tip of each leg <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and rib <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Each seal band <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is substantially the same width in this embodiment. Recess <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> has a width that is selected to increase the contact pressures of seal bands <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> against their seats. However, the widths of the seal bands <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> should be sufficiently large so as to avoid any leakage due to small scratches in the seal bands <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> or seats that occur during installation. Preferably the width of each band <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is several times the width of recess <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, preferably the upper and lower edges of recess <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are tapered. Also, recess <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is preferably a continuous curved surface, having a concave base <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed at a radius. Recess <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is fairly shallow, having a depth that is less than its width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Seal ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is of metal and is constructed so that its seal bands <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> interferingly engage conical surfaces <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The interference causes elastic and permanent yielding when wellhead connector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> connects to wellhead housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The elastic yielding of seal ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> provides the necessary sealing between seal bands <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and conical seats <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, each seal band <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is at the same conical angle relative to the axis of seal ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and on the same conical surface of revolution. This conical angle, however, is preferably slightly different from the angle of its seat <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so as to create more contact stress on the first conical band <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> than the second conical band <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the angle <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is smaller relative to the axis of seal ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> than the angles of seats <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of wellhead members <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Suitable angles <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are in the range from 22 to 45 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the metal body of seal ring <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is preferably of high strength metal, such as a stainless steel having a yield strength at least from 35 to 40 thousand pounds per square inch. A coating <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed on seal bands <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to provide lubrication and prevent galling from occurring. Coating <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is preferably molybdenum sulfide. In the preferred method, seal bands <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are finished to a high degree of smoothness, such as 8 RMS, then thoroughly cleaned.. The molybdenum sulfide is coated on the smooth surface without abrasive blasting the underlying metal. This provides a very smooth surface finish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a contingent gasket <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in the event that primary seal surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of wellhead housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> becomes damaged. Seal ring <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> has an upper seal surface that is the same as in the other embodiments. It has a first seal band <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and a second seal band <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> separated by a recess <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. The lower leg, however differs and may be constructed as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,915. The lower leg has a support section <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> that extends downward, overlying primary seal surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Support section <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is conical, at the same inclination as primary seal surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, however may be at a lesser dimension so that it does not touch. This results in a gap between support section <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and the damaged primary sealing surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Under load, a portion of support section <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> will deflect and touch primary seal surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, but not enough to cause sealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A lower seal surface <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> extends downward from support section <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. Lower seal surface <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> inclines relative to the axis of bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the same inclination as secondary seal surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. It is sized at a greater diameter so as to create an interference fit with secondary seal surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Seal ring <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> has an inner diameter with an upper portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> a that is conical and leads to a central portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that is cylindrical. Central portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>leads to a lower portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that is conical. Central portion <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is of greater diameter than upper and lower portions <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. This provides a recessed or concave inner diameter to assist in the flexibility of seal ring <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The invention has significant advantages. Tests have shown that a seal constructed as above was able to withstand more stringent pressure tests than prior art seals having only a single seal band and no recess. This is particularly important for deepwater subsea well installations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been shown in only two of its forms, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that it is not so limited but is susceptible to various changes without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, although the discussion above deals with permanent or plastic deformation of the seal ring, it is also applicable to metal seal rings designed for elastic deformation. </paragraph>

<claim-text><highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A well assembly, comprising: 
<claim-text>an upper tubular member having a rim and a conical seat located on an inner surface of the rim; </claim-text>
<claim-text>a lower tubular member having a rim and a conical seat located on an inner surface of the rim of the upper tubular member; </claim-text>
<claim-text>a seal having an upper leg that has an outer sealing surface that seals against the seat of the upper tubular member, a lower leg that has an outer sealing surface that seals against the seat of the lower tubular member, and a rib that extends radially outward from a junction of the upper and lower legs; </claim-text>
<claim-text>each of the sealing surfaces comprising two conical bands separated by an annular recess, with one of the conical bands extending from a tip of the leg on which it is located toward the rib, and the other of the conical bands extending from the rib toward the tip of the leg on which it is located; </claim-text>
<claim-text>the recess being smaller in width than the conical bands and having tapered upper and lower edges; </claim-text>
<claim-text>the conical bands being at the same conical angle and in the same conical surface of revolution; </claim-text>
<claim-text>the conical angle of the conical bands being slightly smaller than a conical angle of each of the seats, relative to an axis of the tubular members, so as to cause a greater contact pressure with the conical band that begins at the tip than the conical band that begins at the rib. </claim-text>
