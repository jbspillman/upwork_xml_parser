<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A method for forming a tantalum oxide capacitor is disclosed, and more particularly, a method for forming a tantalum oxide capacitor is disclosed in which tantalum oxide is deposited by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process so that the step-coverage of the tantalum oxide layer is improved and accordingly the electrical characteristics of the resultant capacitor are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, a capacitor stores a charge and then supplies the charge required for the operation of a device, such as a semiconductor device. As the integration of the semiconductor devices increases, the size of the cells becomes smaller, and the capacitance required for the operation of the devices increases. The capacitance required in a semiconductor device having a greater integration than 64M DRAM is greater than 30 pF per cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Also, as the integration of the semiconductor devices increases, miniaturization of capacitors has been required. However, due to the limitation of the size required in storing a charge to satisfy a required capacitance, difficulties arise in miniaturizing semiconductor capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The N/O (SiN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>/SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) capacitor, which is in current use, cannot be employed with the next generation DRAM which has an integration of greater than 256M. As a result, a tantalum oxide capacitor has been developed. However, as the aspect ratio increases in the tantalum oxide layer according to the miniaturization of the device, the step-coverage characteristic deteriorates. For example, as the design rule is reduced from 0.16 &mgr;m to 0.13 &mgr;m, the step-coverage may be reduced from 96% to 73%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The reduction of the step-coverage may cause deterioration of the electrical properties of the capacitor, which cause reduction of capacitance of the capacitor. Therefore, a capacitance sufficient to operate the semiconductor cannot be secured. Furthermore, if the lower electrode is made of a metal, the tantalum oxide layer may not be deposited evenly due to the roughness of the surface of the metal, so there is a possibility that the tantalum oxide layer will become too thin in some locations. Such a phenomenon causes a leakage current since the electric field is concentrated when a bias is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Due to such a problem of the conventional art, there is a considerable need for forming the tantalum oxide layer uniformly on the lower electrode, to increase the step coverage and prevent the problem of the tantalum oxide layer becoming too thin as a result of the roughness of the underlying metal electrode. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Methods for forming a tantalum oxide capacitor are disclosed, in which tantalum oxide is deposited by an atomic layer deposition ALD process so that the tantalum oxide layer is deposited uniformly on a lower electrode, whereby the step-coverage of the tantalum oxide layer is improved and accordingly the electrical characteristics of the capacitor are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One disclosed method for forming a tantalum oxide capacitor comprises: forming a nitride layer by nitriding an upper part of a lower electrode; depositing a tantalum-nitride Ta&mdash;N layer on the nitride layer by using an atomic layer deposition ALD method; forming a tantalum oxide layer by oxidizing the tantalum-nitride layer; and forming an upper electrode on the tantalum oxide layer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</cross-reference> consecutively illustrate a disclosed process for manufacturing a tantalum oxide capacitor. In the drawings, the construction of the lower electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown as a single layer since that is not the main subject of this disclosure. Variations of the lower electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to one disclosed process, a nitride layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is first formed on a lower electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by nitriding the upper part of the lower electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> More particularly, such a process prevents the forming of an oxide layer (silicon oxide) of low dielectric constant, which may be formed on an interface when a tantalum oxide layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is deposited on the lower electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, wherein the surface of polysilicon is nitrided by using a plasma under a NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere (or N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O atmosphere) at a temperature ranging from about 200 to about 600&deg; C., by an In-Situ process in a low pressure chemical vapor deposition chamber. In such a situation, in substitution for using the plasma, a rapid thermal process (RTP) by Ex-Situ or an electrical furnace can be used to nitride in a temperature ranging from about 600 to about 950&deg; C. under an ammonia atmosphere for a time period ranging from about 1 to about 30 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> However, if the lower electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is made of a metal, the nitriding process becomes different according to the kind of the metal, and in general, the process is performed in a lower temperature than in the case the lower electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is made of polysilicon. More particularly, the surface of the lower electrode is nitrided using a plasma under NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere (or N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere) at a temperature ranging from about 200 to about 450&deg; C., by an In-Situ process in a low pressure chemical vapor deposition chamber. Also in such a situation, instead of using plasma, a RTP by Ex-Situ or an electrical furnace can be used to nitride at a temperature ranging from about 400 to about 600&deg; C. under an ammonia atmosphere (or N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> atmosphere), for a time period ranging from about 10 to about 100 seconds and, in case of a RTP and for a time period ranging from about 1 to about 100 minutes in case of the electrical furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> tantalum-nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is deposited on the nitride layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> using an atomic layer deposition process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In performing such a process, a tantalum atomic layer is formed by applying a tantalum hydro fluoride pulse, applying N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or Ar or another inert gas onto tantalum atomic layer, and a nitride atomic layer is formed by applying an ammonia NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>pulse. Then, the tantalum atoms and the nitride atoms are combined with each other, to form a tantalum-nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In such a situation, the chemical vapor of a tantalum compound such as the tantalum hydro fluoride can be achieved by supplying a predetermined quantity of the tantalum compound gauged by a quantity controller such as a mass flow controller MFC into an evaporator or an evaporation pipe, and then evaporating the tantalum compound at a temperature ranging from about 150 to about 200&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> After such a process, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> tantalum oxide layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed by oxidizing the tantalum-nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, whereby the nitride in the tantalum-nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is substituted by the oxide to form a stable tantalum oxide layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the tantalum-nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is oxidized by applying oxygen using a plasma at a temperature ranging from about 200 to about 600&deg; C. by an In-Situ process in a low pressure chemical vapor deposition chamber. In such a situation, as a substitute for the plasma, an RTP by Ex-Situ or an electrical furnace can be used to oxidize at a temperature ranging from about 600 to about 950&deg; C. for a time period ranging from about 1 to about 30 minutes under an oxygen atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> However, in case the lower electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is made of a metal, the oxidizing process becomes different, and according to the crystalline variation or the proceeding of oxidization, the oxidization process is performed at a lower temperature than in the case the lower electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is made of polysilicon. More particularly, the tantalum-nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be oxidized by applying oxygen using a plasma at a temperature ranging from about 200 to about 450&deg; C. by an In-Situ process in a low pressure chemical vapor deposition chamber. Also in such a situation, as a substitute for the plasma, an RTP by Ex-Situ or an electrical furnace can be used to oxidize at a temperature ranging from about 400 to about 600&deg; C. under an oxygen atmosphere, for a time period ranging from about 10 to about 100 seconds in case of the RTP, and for a time period ranging from about 1 to about 100 minutes in case of the electrical furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> After the oxidizing process, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the capacitor is manufactured completely by forming the upper electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The upper electrode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be formed by depositing a single layer or a multiple layer with one or more materials selected from the group consisting of a polysilicon, titanium nitride (TiN), tantalum nitride (TaN), tungsten (W), tungsten nitride (WN), tungsten suicide (WSi), ruthenium (Ru), ruthenium oxide (RuO2), iridium (Ir), iridium oxide (IrO2), and Platinum (Pt). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the disclosed method for forming a tantalum oxide capacitor, tantalum oxide is uniformly deposited by an atomic layer deposition ALD process, and therefore, the step-coverage of the tantalum oxide layer is improved and the electrical characteristics of the capacitor are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in comparison with the conventional atomic layer deposition method, the disclosed method includes fewer process steps, so the time and cost can be reduced and the productivity of the entire manufacturing process can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred embodiment has been described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that this disclosure should not be limited to the described preferred embodiment, but various changes and modifications can be made within the spirit and the scope of this disclosure. Accordingly, the scope of this disclosure is not limited by the described range but the following claims. </paragraph>
