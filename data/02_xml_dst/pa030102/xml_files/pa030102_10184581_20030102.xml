<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a facility and a method of operating a facility for providing care, and especially to a facility and a method of operating a facility for providing care to patients with diminished mental and/or physical capacity (such as Alzheimer patients). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Alzheimer Disease causes gradual breakdown in the nerve cells of the brain. The brain changes and no longer works as it used to. As a result, people with Alzheimer Disease become less and less able to make sense of information from the outside world and to send messages to their bodies. People with Alzheimer Disease become unable to think, remember, understand, and make decisions as before. They generally have trouble with everyday activities such as getting dressed, cooking a meal, or washing the car. Eventually, Alzheimer patients become unable to look after themselves and will develop other illnesses such as pneumonia, which will cause death. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In current care facilities for Alzheimer patients and patients suffering from other debilitating diseases, the safety and health of the patient are primary concerns. However, little effort has been made to improve the quality of life of such patients in terms of their day-to-day enjoyment of their surroundings. Activities are very limited in current facilities. More attention to such quality of life issues would certainly increase patient enjoyment and may be beneficial to their overall health. Moreover, improving the quality of life of these patients may also improve the well being of the family and friends of the patients as placing a loved one in a care facility is typically a traumatic and trying experience that often extends for years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Statistics indicate that one out of five people will need special care at some point in their lives. It is thus very desirable to develop methods and facilities for caring for patients requiring professional care that improve their quality of life and that of the people closely associated with them. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention provides a facility for providing care to debilitated patients including: a residence area staffed with health care professionals and a plurality of areas having different entertainment (for example, festive, holiday, game or sporting) themes (that is, different implicit or recurrent ideas or a motifs). Each of the areas can, for example, have a different theme or one or more themes can be generally repeated in more than one area. In one embodiment, a different holiday theme is provided in each of a plurality of areas. The different areas can be in different structures or buildings or can be located in a single structure. Preferably, one or all of the areas are accessible to patients with generally any affliction (mental or physical) and to generally all age groups (including children). The facility can also include at least one classroom area. The classroom area can, for example, be used to provide instruction at a grade level commensurate with the ability of the patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The facility can also include at least one restaurant that is handicap accessible. The restaurant can be staffed by at least one trained health care provider or professional (for example, a nurses&apos; aid). Likewise, a plurality of the staff (for example, the servers) can be trained health care providers. The restaurant can be open to the public. The restaurant can also include an area for feeding and/or care of pets. The area for feeding and care of pets is preferably suitably separated from the restaurant area for the patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for providing care to debilitated patients comprising: providing a residence area staffed with health care professionals where patients can live; and providing a plurality of areas in the vicinity of the residence area for use by the patients. The area have different entertainment themes as described above. The areas can be open to the public (that is, to non-patients such as family and friends).

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the present invention provides a facility <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> including a residence area or building <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which can include a large lounge, a dining area, and an old-fashioned, grade school classroom <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (for example, a third-grade classroom) complete with teacher and daily activities for the residents. The residence area can, for example, have on the perimeter of an upper floor or elsewhere therein a plurality of single or double rooms depending on the desired residency capacity. Building <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can also include meeting rooms, storage, and can include an handicap accessible exit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. One or more handicap accessible ramps can be provided between different levels or floors making all areas handicap accessible. Handicap accessible elevators can also be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Facility <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can include a handicap accessible restaurant <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (for example, a buffet-style restaurant) that caters to the needs and desires of physically and mentally handicapped men, women and children as well as their family and friends. Restaurant <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be open to the public and can provide an atmosphere where anyone can bring a loved one, relative, or friend and not be concerned about care provided and not embarrassed in any way. At least one of the servers or other restaurant staff is preferably a trained health care provider or professionals (for example, a nurses&apos; aid) that can assist in substantially any way. Preferably, a plurality of the servers or other restaurant staff are trained health care providers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The menu of restaurant <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can, for example, include some regular diet items and some special, for example, soft, diet items&mdash;preferably at affordable prices. The main staff and nurses of facility <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are preferably on call for any emergency.

Suitable exits, bathrooms and dining tables can be provided for such clientele. Bathrooms can, for example, include changing tables for the incontinent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, along the outer perimeter of facility <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are constructed or provided a plurality (seven in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) of areas <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Each of areas <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be decorated or otherwise designed around an entertainment theme, for example, a sporting, game, festive or holiday theme. Areas <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can, for example be chalet-style shops.
