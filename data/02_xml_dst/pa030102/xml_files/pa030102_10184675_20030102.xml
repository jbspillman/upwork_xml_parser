<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a variable movement headrest arrangement for providing support to the head of an occupant of a vehicle upon vehicle impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Improvements in safety mechanisms in the automotive industry continue to be made year after year. Such safety mechanisms include safety headrests. An example of safety seat headrests can be found in Viano et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,043, which is incorporated herein by reference. Such safety headrest mechanisms provide support to the head of a vehicle occupant during crash situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> More specifically, upon rear impact of a vehicle, the occupant of the vehicle compresses into the vehicle seatback, as the head, neck, and torso move substantially in unison. There typically is greater compression in the torso and buttocks regions than in the shoulder region of the occupant. Thus, it has been a concern that the seatback may possibly deflect under the torso and buttocks load before the head and neck of the occupant contacts the headrest attached to the seatback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Upon front impact of a vehicle, an occupant of the vehicle moves forward relative to the vehicle seatback. Upon contact with a front interior panel or a deployed airbag from the front panel, the occupant experiences rebound movement in a rearward direction. Similar to a rear impact situation as described above, the occupant in such a situation would then provide a rearward load into the seatback and compress into the vehicle seatback, as the head, neck, torso, and buttocks move substantially in unison. Thus, in a front impact it is also a concern that the seatback may possibly deflect under the torso load prior to the head and neck of the occupant contacting the headrest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As a result, safety headrest mechanisms have been designed such that, upon impact having rearward movement of a seat occupant, the occupant&apos;s torso contacts an impact target of a vehicle seat with a rearward load or force. The impact target is operatively connected to a headrest or such that, upon the rearward load on the impact target, the headrest portion moves forward toward the head of the occupant. The forward movement of the headrest portion in the crash situation lessens the gap which may exist between the occupant&apos;s head and the headrest portion, preventing or lessening the risk of whiplash to the occupant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, it is desirable to have the headrest arrangement move forward at a high initial velocity in order to decrease the gap between the occupant&apos;s head and headrest portion more quickly, but without contacting the occupant&apos;s head while moving at the high initial velocity. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a cost effective mechanism to support the head of an occupant of a vehicle upon front and rear vehicle impact. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a vehicle seat and headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having seat bottom <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with fore end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and aft end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>seatback <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> joined to seat bottom <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> adjacent aft end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> pivotally and slidably attached to seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes moveable headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which, in this and in most typical embodiments, is cushioned. As will be described in greater detail below, headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> moves variably upon vehicle impact. In the embodiment shown, such variable movement occurs in first and second manners wherein the first and second manners relate to first and second forward velocities respectively, those being the velocities of the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> forward toward the occupant or the front of the vehicle, and first and second trajectories respectively, those being the trajectories or paths of headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Such variable movement could be along any suitable combination of trajectories and velocities. As long as at least one of the first forward velocity and first trajectory is different than one of a second forward velocity and second trajectory, movement in first and second manners, variable movement, has been achieved. However, as will be explained in more detail, in the event of a vehicle impact, it is preferable that the headrest move in a first manner so as to more quickly lessen the gap between the head of an occupant and the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and move in a second manner so as to decrease the forward velocity and provide support upon contact with the occupant&apos;s head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As will be also described in greater detail below, headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is guidedly or cammingly moved from the normal position to the actuated position upon impact and irrespective of, or prior to, the occupant being in contact with the seatback <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> movable with respect to seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As shown, seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes upper cross member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having ends <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, each of which have a side member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> integrally attached thereto and extending downwardly therefrom. Lower cross member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends across seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to connect side members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Lower cross member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be attached to side members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by any suitable means, such as by bolts (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the upper cross member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes at least one guide member, in this embodiment bushings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Such bushings may be attached to the cross member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or formed within the cross member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. While not shown, the guide members could also be connected to any part of the seatback frame. Furthermore, the guide members, such as the bushings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> shown, may be fixedly, rotatably, or otherwise movably connected to seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by any suitable means. In this embodiment, bushings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are welded to upper cross member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown, headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having cushion frame <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, headrest extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extending downwardly therefrom, and impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to which extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends. The impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may have any suitable configuration or shape and may be made from any suitable material. In this embodiment, impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is disposed within seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and between side members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are operatively associated as the headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> moves variably with respect to the seat back frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As described in greater detail below, headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> cooperates with seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to define shifting axes about which headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> pivots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, headrest extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends downwardly from cushion frame <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through each guide member, in this embodiment bushings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, to an impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Each guide member defines a guideway, in this embodiment guideway <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As shown, the headrest extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in this embodiment constitutes two posts. However, a single post or any other suitable extension may be utilized. Likewise, a single guide member or any other suitable number of guide members may be utilized. Furthermore, while not shown the headrest extension of the headrest arrangement could include or constitute an upper portion or part of the seatback frame such that the upper portion or part could move variably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in this embodiment, one or more movement-allowing connectors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, such as links or hinges shown, may be used to pivotally or otherwise suitably attach impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to side members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Such movement-allowing connectors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be connected at each end to the impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and side member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> respectively, in a pivotal, fixed, or otherwise suitable manner. More specifically, as shown in the embodiment depicted, each of the movement-allowing connectors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be pivotally attached to the seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on pivot axis A generally perpendicular to the fore and aft direction. The other end of the movement-allowing connector may also be pivotally attached to the impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>, the pivot axis A is offset relative to the impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> such that a rearward force applied to the impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will tend to cause the movement-allowing connector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to pivot about the pivot axis A and the impact target to move in a generally rearward and upward direction. Of course, any other suitable movement-allowing connector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> between the impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the side member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, or between any suitable portion of the headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, could be used, such as multiple linkages for example, such that the impact target pivots about a fixed or variable (instantaneous) pivot axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Rearward loading of impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will cause headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to pivot toward the head of the occupant. Preferably, a suitable biasing member is operatively associated with the seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in order to bias headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> against such movement. As shown in this embodiment, such biasing member may consist of springs <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> attached between the lower cross member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and each link <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. However, such biasing member may be operatively associated with or between the seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner. Furthermore, while in this embodiment, spring <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is a metallic coil, any suitable biasing member, such as an elastic tube, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in this embodiment, a damper <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be connected to the impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for retarding rearward movement of headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as will be described in further detail. The damper <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be any suitable dampening or biasing material, device, or mechanism which lengthens, expands, or extends under a relatively light or suitable tensile load while suitably retarding, which may include preventing, movement under a compressive load. If one or more dampers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are employed, they may be disposed at any suitable location , and be connected between the seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or any other suitable component, and the impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the headrest extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, or any other suitable component in any suitable manner and at any suitable location in order to retard rearward movement of headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, and without limitation, dampers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be disposed between the lower cross member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and links <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in one embodiment of the present invention the guide member, in this embodiment the bushing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, includes a guideway <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which in this embodiment includes a cam configuration <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a first movement portion and a second movement portion, the operation of which is described in paragraphs below. While the guideway <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in this embodiment has a first movement portion and a second movement portion, the guideway <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is not limited to such a configuration but may have any suitable configuration. Furthermore, the guide member could utilize a slot or any other suitable configuration in guiding the follower as will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The cam configuration <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in this embodiment includes a first guideway wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a second guideway wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As shown, second guideway wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may have first contact portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and second contact portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> formed vertically adjacent each other and integrally connected. In this embodiment the first guideway wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a relatively flat surface configuration inclined at an angle relative to the adjacent portion of the extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The first contact portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and second contact portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the second guideway wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> both have relatively curved or arcuate surface configurations. Of course, any other suitable configuration of the first and second guideway walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be used. Likewise, any suitable configuration of first and second contact portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, may be used </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the follower <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, in this embodiment a cam <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, may be disposed on extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Cam <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be disposed on extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by any suitable means such as by welding or molding. The follower <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, in this embodiment cam <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, cooperates with the guideway <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the guide member, in this embodiment the bushing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having a cam configuration <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with a first guideway wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and second guideway wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. While the follower in this embodiment is a cam, any other suitable follower configuration could be utilized, such as a projection projecting laterally from the extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and engaging a slot or other suitable configuration of the guide member. Furthermore, while in this embodiment the follower is connected to the extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the guide member is connected to the seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the follower could also be connected to the seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the guide member could be connected to the extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The follower, in this embodiment the cam <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, has a first follower portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a second follower portion <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The second follower portion <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> includes a first surface portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a second surface portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed vertically adjacent each other and integrally connected. As shown in this embodiment, first and second surface portions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may have similar arcuate or curved surface configurations. However, any other suitable configurations of the first and second surface portions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be used and the configurations of the first and second surface portions may be mirror images of each other or different. In the embodiment shown, while extending the first surface portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> initially at approximately 30 degrees from the extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to cooperate with the first contact portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the second passageway wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has been found to be satisfactory, any suitable angle may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown, and as discussed in further detail below, in this embodiment the first and second surface portions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> slidably contact first and second contact portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively, to provide improved head support to the occupant upon vehicle impact. Of course, first surface portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may also slidably contact second contact portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and second surface portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may also slidably contact first contact portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, in this embodiment the first follower portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> extends from extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> opposite first and second surface portions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and has a first follower end <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to slidably contact the first guideway wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. While the first follower end <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the first follower portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has been shown in this embodiment to have a relatively flat surface configuration, inclined relative to the extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to slidably cooperate with the first passageway wall, any other suitable configuration may be used. During normal use of the vehicle seat and headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the first follower portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> serves to prevent the extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from shifting back and forth, and to provide a substantially snug fit within the guide member, in this embodiment the bushing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> However, upon vehicle impact, first and second follower portions <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and first and second guideway walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, are configured to cooperate together to move headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in first and second manners, e.g., first and second forward velocities and first and second trajectories of headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. More specifically, upon impact of the vehicle, an occupant of the vehicle provides rearward load on impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In turn, connectors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> pivot about axis A and the impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> moves in a generally rearward and upward direction. As a result, extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> slides upwardly through the guideway <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the guide member, in this embodiment the bushing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and first surface portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> slides along first contact portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and first follower portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> slides along first guideway wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This movement, movement in the first manner, defines the first forward velocity and first trajectory of headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> toward and relative to the occupant&apos;s head. This movement also defines the first movement portion. More specifically, this movement in the first manner causes the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to pivot with respect to the seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> along a first trajectory about and above a constant or shifting axis. The first trajectory and the force of the impact define a first forward velocity of the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> toward the head of the seat occupant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Then, the second surface portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> slides along second contact portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as follower portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> continues to slide along and past first guideway wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This movement, movement in the second manner, defines the second velocity and second trajectory of headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> toward and relative to the occupant&apos;s head. This movement also defines the second movement portion. More specifically, this movement in the second manner causes the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to pivot with respect to the seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> along a second trajectory about and above a constant or shifting axis. The second trajectory and the force of the impact define a second forward velocity of the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> toward the head of the seat occupant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Each of the constant or shifting axes is the pivot axis, also called the instant center axis, instantaneous pivot axis, or instantaneous axis, about which the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> pivots at any given time during movement along a particular trajectory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments shown, the pivot axis, also called the instant center axis, instantaneous pivot axis, or instantaneous axis, about which the headrest portion pivots shifts throughout the trajectories of the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> during a rearward loading of the impact target. Shifting the instantaneous axis downwardly allows the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move in a more forwardly direction toward the occupant&apos;s head upon a rearward force to the impact target. Preferably, the vehicle seat and headrest arrangement is such that the instantaneous axis shifts within a relatively lower range of positions during camming between the first surface portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the first contact portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The resulting trajectory is such that the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will move in a direction more directed toward the occupant&apos;s head during the course of the first trajectory. Shifting the instantaneous axis upwardly, within a relatively higher range of positions, after the movement in the first manner has been accomplished, allows the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move more upwardly, and support the occupant&apos;s head, during movement in the second manner. In the embodiments shown, the cam is formed such that the instantaneous axis shifts upwardly upon contact of the second surface portion with the second contact portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In summary, upon vehicle impact, the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> moves forwardly and upwardly in first and second manners, along first and the second trajectories, and at first and second forward velocities. The greater the crash acceleration, the greater the velocity of headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the first and second manners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Although both trajectories provide for both forward and upward movement of the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the first trajectory allows the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move more forwardly and the second trajectory allows the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move more upwardly. The first forward velocity is preferably greater than the second forward velocity. The first forward velocity allows the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to quickly move a predetermined distance to lessen the gap between the occupant&apos;s head and the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The second velocity allows the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to further lessen the gap and to slow down or stop relative to the seat occupant&apos;s head for supporting the occupant&apos;s head upon contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In this particular embodiment, headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> moves in a forward and upward direction for a predetermined distance toward the occupant&apos;s head in order to lessen the gap therebetween. More specifically, during movement of the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the first and second trajectories, the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is configured to move forward a predetermined distance. While a distance range between 2 and 25 centimeters may be suitable, any suitable distance may be used and will be dependent, at least in part, on the interior design parameters of the particular vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the particular embodiment shown, due to the configuration of the first surface portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the first contact portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> moves more forwardly than upwardly to define the first trajectory, providing the first forward velocity. Due to the configuration of the second surface portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the second contact portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> moves more upwardly than forwardly to define the second trajectory, providing the second forward velocity. Thus, in this embodiment, the first forward velocity is greater then the second forward velocity in the direction toward the head of the vehicle occupant. Accordingly, surface portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and contact portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are designed to reduce headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> movement directly toward the occupant&apos;s head after movement in the first manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In normal vehicle seat and headrest arrangements, during the initial stages of an impact, the occupant&apos;s torso is in contact with the seatback while the occupant&apos;s head is several inches forward of the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This condition is consistent with the body being reclined at about 20-25 degrees from vertical with the neck being approximately vertical. In contrast, the seat is usually at a reclined angle of approximately 20-25 degrees from vertical, with the headrest either following the inclination of the seatback or curving slightly forward. In any event, for seating comfort, the head is usually not in contact with the headrest while driving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As the occupant loads the seatback in an impact, force builds up behind the torso and buttocks of the seat occupant as the head, neck, torso, and buttocks move in unison. Typically, there is a greater compression in the torso and buttocks regions of the seat, with a gradual reduction up to the shoulder level as the body remains upright. The more severe the crash, the greater the compression of the occupant into the seatback. As this action is occurring, the initial load of the occupant tends to deflect the seatback rearwardly. The amount of deflection is related to the bending stiffness of the seatback. The seatback may possibly deflect under the torso load prior to the head and neck of the occupant contacting the headrest. The current invention reduces this &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; effect by bringing the headrest forward into a head supporting position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In a front impact of the vehicle, the occupant initially moves forward relative to the vehicle seatback. Upon contact with a front interior panel or a deployed airbag from the front panel of the vehicle, the occupant experiences rebound movement in a rearward direction. As the occupant loads the seatback in a rebound during the front impact, force builds up behind the torso and buttocks of the occupant. Like a rear impact, depending upon the compliance of the seatback, the occupant compresses into the cushion as the head, neck, and torso move in unison. In this situation, like in a rear impact situation, there is a greater compression in the buttocks region than in the shoulder region of the occupant. Thus, there is a potential that the seatback deflects under the torso load prior to the head and neck of the occupant contacting the headrest, resulting in a gap between the head and the headrest in a front crash situation and the potential for a &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> With the present invention and in the event of a front impact, the sudden substantial deceleration in forward velocity will cause the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move forward from the normal position, independent of the occupant contacting the seatback <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or impact plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Upon front impact of the vehicle, when the occupant is initially thrown forward, the forward inertia of the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will cause the follower <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to follow the guideway <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> such that the first follower end <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> will slidably engage the first guideway wall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> while the first surface portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> slidably engages the first contact portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This allows headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move at least in the first manner, at the first forward velocity and along the first trajectory. Then, similar to a rear impact situation described above, the second surface portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> will slidably engage the second contact portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This allows the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move in the second manner, at the second forward velocity and along the second trajectory. As in a rear impact situation, the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will then have moved in a forward direction for a predetermined distance toward the occupant&apos;s head in order to lessen the gap between the headrest and the occupant&apos;s head. The damper <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> serves to retard, which may include preventing, movement of the headrest back from the actuated or forward position back to the non-actuated or normal position before and after contact between the occupant&apos;s head and the headrest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> depict another embodiment which operates similar to the embodiment described above. This embodiment includes components similar to components of vehicle seat and headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> above. Similar components will be referred to by the same reference characters used to identify like components in the first embodiment. However, in this embodiment, a different guide member, bushing <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, is disposed on seatback frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and includes a first guideway wall <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and second guideway wall <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> having a pair of first and second contact portions <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. A follower, in this embodiment a cam <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, is disposed on extension <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and includes a pair of first and second surface portions <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> formed to cooperate with the pair of first and second contact portions <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, respectively. As shown, the first guideway wall <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> includes a planar surface upon which a first follower portion <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> slides during movement of the headrest arrangement <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Similar to the embodiment described above, the first and second surface portions <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> slidably contact the first and second contact portions <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, respectively, to define first and second forward velocities and first and second trajectories of the headrest <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> during vehicle impact and to accordingly provide improved head support to the occupant upon vehicle impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> While not shown, as a further alternative example embodiment, the invention may be constructed such that the impact target <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is not connected to the side member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, the impact target could be supported in the non-impact position via a guide member and follower for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the embodiments described above may be made by any conventional means using any conventional materials known in the vehicle seating art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts one method <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of supporting the head of a vehicle occupant in a vehicle seat having a seatback and a headrest arrangement movable with respect to the seatback. Method <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> includes providing the headrest adapted to be spaced from the head of the occupant in the seat to define a normal or rest position of the headrest arrangement in block <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. In the normal position, an instant center of the headrest arrangement is designed or configured substantially lower relative to the center of gravity of the headrest arrangement. Thus, upon front impact of the vehicle in block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, the headrest arrangement independently moves from the normal position toward contact with the occupant&apos;s head in a first manner and a second manner to define an actuated position of the headrest, irrespective of the occupant being in contact with the seatback of the vehicle seat. The configuration of the guideway and the follower allows the headrest to independently move forward to support the occupant&apos;s head upon a front impact in a first manner and second manner. As described above, the first manner involves the headrest moving along a first trajectory at a first forward velocity. The second manner involves the headrest moving along a second trajectory at a second forward velocity. In block <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the method includes retarding movement of the headrest arrangement back from the actuated position to the normal position, before and after contact with the head. The damper retards such movement. This provides improved support to the occupant&apos;s head from rebound toward the seatback in the case of a front impact. </paragraph>
