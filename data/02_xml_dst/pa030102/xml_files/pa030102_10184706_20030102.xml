<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Disclosure </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The disclosure relates to a method for forming a capacitor of a semiconductor device and, more particularly, to a method for forming a metal (MIS) capacitor of a semiconductor device, in which a TiN layer forming an upper electrode is deposited by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method using an MO source in a low temperature, whereby crystallization of TiN is minimized to prevent roughness of the surface, and Cl is not contained in the TiN layer to improve the leakage current characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As the manufacturing technology of semiconductor integrated circuits has been developed, the width of the element formed on a semiconductor substrate has become finer, and the level of integration per unit area has increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as the integration of memory cells increases, the space occupied by the capacitor for storing the charge has become narrower, so the development of the cell capacitor with a high capacitance per unit area is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, the capacitor stores a charge and then supplies the charge required for the operation of the semiconductor device, and as the integration of the semiconductor increases, the size of the cells becomes smaller whereas the capacitance required for the operation of the semiconductor device increases little by little. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As the degree of integration of semiconductor device increases, miniaturization of the capacitor has been required in the conventional art. However, according to the limitation of the charging capacitance, a difficulty in making high integration capacitors in regard to the size of cells has arisen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, to overcome such a problem, in order to increase the amount of charge stored in the capacitor, a material having a high dielectric constant such as TaON has been used to form a dielectric layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view illustrating the problem of a capacitor formed by a conventional method of forming a capacitor of a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as the upper electrode is deposited on the dielectric layer at a high temperature, the surface roughness as in &ldquo;A&rdquo; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> occurs, which results in reduction of capacitance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, since the upper electrode is made of chemical vapor deposited (CVD) TiN using TiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>as a source, if the thickness of the electrode is greater than 500 &angst;, the Cl contained in the upper electrode causes a crack on the surface of the upper electrode to increase the leakage of current. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The disclosure provides a method for forming a metal (MIS) capacitor of a semiconductor device, in which a TiN layer forming an upper electrode is deposited by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method using an MO source at low temperature, whereby the crystallization of TiN is minimized to prevent the roughness of the surface, and Cl is not contained in the TiN layer to improve a leakage current characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the disclosure provides a method for forming a capacitor of a semiconductor device, comprising the steps of: forming a nitride layer by a nitriding process or nitric-oxidizing process on a surface of a silicon substrate formed with a lower electrode; forming a dielectric material layer made of a tantalum on the nitride layer, with a chemical vapor; and forming a TiN layer that is an upper electrode, on the dielectric material layer with an ALD method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The upper electrode is preferably formed by a cycle including a TEMAT vapor pulse or TDMAT vapor pulse, an Ar or N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>purge, a NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas pulse, and an Ar or N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>purge. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a method will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2C</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views for illustrating the consecutive steps of a method for forming a capacitor of a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> nitride layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is formed by a nitriding process or nitric-oxidizing process on the surface of a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, using a plasma, a rapid thermal process (RTP), or furnace, so that the forming of a oxide layer of low dielectric constant on an interface is prevented when a dielectric layer which is an amorphous TaON layer is deposited later on the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> formed with a metallic lower electrode (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Here, the nitride layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be formed by performing the nitriding process or the nitric-oxidizing process on the surface of the semiconductor device, by supplying a mixture of NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas or NO gas with a rapid thermal process at a temperature of 700&deg; C. to 900&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Further, the nitride layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be formed by performing the nitriding process or the nitric-oxidizing process on the surface of the semiconductor device, by an in-situ process, by using a plasma in an atmosphere of NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas at a temperature of 300&deg; C. to 600&deg; C., for 30 seconds to 10 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B, a</cross-reference> dielectric material layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which is an amorphous TaON layer is formed by a surface chemical reaction on the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which has undergone the nitride process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In that situation, the TaON layer is formed by forming a tantalum atomic layer by applying a tantalum hydrofluoride pulse, performing a purge process with nitrogen or argon, forming a nitride atomic layer by applying an ammonia pulse and, consequently, combining the tantalum atoms with the nitride atoms to form a tantalum nitride film (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the chemical vapor of a tantalum compound such as the tantalum hydrofluoride is formed by supplying a predetermined quantity of the tantalum compound gauged by a quantity controller to an evaporator or an evaporation pipe, and then evaporating the gauged quantity of the tantalum compound at a temperature of 150&deg; C. to 200&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Also, the tantalum oxide film is formed by oxidizing the tantalum nitride film (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In such a situation, a dielectric material layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be formed using Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>in substitution for TaON, and the uniformity of the dielectric material layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is improved by a thermal treatment at high or low temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C, a</cross-reference> TiN layer that is an upper electrode <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is formed on the dielectric material layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> with an ALD method at a low temperature of 50&deg; C. to 350&deg; C., using an MO source, that is, Ti(N(C2H5CH3)2)4 (TEMAT) and NH3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In such a situation, Ti(N(CH3)2)4 (TDMAT) can be used as the MO source in substitution for the TEMAT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the TiN layer that is the upper electrode <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is formed by a cycle indicating a TEMAT vapor pulse or a TDMAT vapor pulse, an Ar or N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>purge, an NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas pulse, and an Ar or N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>purge, to a thickness of 50 &angst; to 1600 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> However, in case the upper electrode <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> indicates a TiN layer formed by the ALD method and a TiN layer formed by a sputter so as to increase thickness, the TiN layer according to the ALD method is formed having a thickness of 50 &angst; to 300 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to the disclosure, a method for forming a metal MIS capacitor of a semiconductor device is provided, in which a TiN layer forming an upper electrode is deposited by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method using an MO source at low temperature, whereby the crystallization of TiN is minimized to prevent roughness of the surface, and Cl is not contained in the TiN layer to improve the leakage current characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Although a preferred embodiment of the method has been described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the method should not be limited to the described preferred embodiment, but various changes and modifications can be made within the spirit and the scope of the disclosure.
