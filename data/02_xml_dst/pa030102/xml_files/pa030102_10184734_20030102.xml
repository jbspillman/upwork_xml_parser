<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART STATEMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a door handle assembling construction used for an outside handle of, for example, a four-wheel vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> When an outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is assembled to a door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of an automobile door as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pulled to turn a bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and then is moved to a position in which the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is less liable to interfere with a square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> to prevent interference of the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a counter weight <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which constitute a mechanism section of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, with the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. At the time of assembling, the worker must always perform a motion of passing the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>while pulling the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> With this method, the worker must perform the assembling work while maintaining, by hand, a state in which the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is pulled out against the urging force of a spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the worker is forced to keep an unnatural posture and a pulling force. This work is a troublesome work, and thus it brings about an increase in fatigue of worker and a decrease in work efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to decrease the force for pulling out the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to make the work easy to do, it can be thought that the reaction force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is decreased so that the worker can pull out the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> easily, thereby reducing the load on the worker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In some cases, however, the reaction force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is increased so as to improve the sense of heaviness in order to take measures for the improvement in the sense of operation of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the improvement in the quality of sound in opening and closing the door, the prevention of opening of door at the time of side impact, and the like. Also, in some cases, the reaction force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is utilized to secure a weight balance between the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the handle mechanism section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Thus, there is a tendency to increase the reaction force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> according to the conditions, so that it is difficult to decrease the urging force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to a degree such as not to impose a load on the worker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Also, even if the force for the worker to pull out the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is decreased, the pulling motion itself cannot be eliminated. Also, as described above, the decrease in the reaction force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> degrades the quality such as the sense of operation, the quality of sound, and the prevention of opening of door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As a method for solving the above-described problems, there is available a method in which the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is temporarily fixed by using a separate stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that does not relate to the function of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. In this method, the stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is inserted between the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by pulling out the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is temporarily fixed by utilizing a force of pulling the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the direction of F2 by means of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, by which a state in which the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pulled is maintained. The use of this method eliminates the need for decreasing the reaction force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and enables the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to be set freely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In this method, however, it is necessary to perform the work for installing the stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the work for removing the stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> after the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is assembled to a door <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the number of work steps increases undesirably. Also, since it is difficult to use the removed stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for another purpose as a part assembled to the vehicle, the removed stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> must be disposed of or recycled. Therefore, the manpower for waste disposal and management work relating to the vendor is needed. That is to say, the above-described method suffers disadvantages in terms of environment, work manpower, and parts control. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is fixed to a door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the base portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed with a hole <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>through which an arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>projecting from the back side (front side of the figure) of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the cabin side is inserted. On the back face of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a wall portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is erected so as to surround the hole <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>. When the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is fixed to the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the wall portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>erects toward the door inside (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Also, the wall portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is mounted with a bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> serving as a mechanism section with a pin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> so as to be turnable. Further, the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to the rod <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the door latch <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by a clip <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is urged in the direction such as to pull up the rod <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by a spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>). At the upper part of the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is fixed a counterweight <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The counterweight <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> plays a role of a balance weight for preventing unintended rotation of the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> caused when the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is pulled out to the outside by an inertial force at the time when a shock is applied to the door from the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> stopper portion (protruding portion) <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is provided on the inside at the end of the wall portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>erecting on the back face of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed by a groove or a protrusion provided on the wall portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is pulled out and the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is tilted through angle A as compared with the state in which the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is installed to the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (see reference character <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a corner portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>at the tip end of the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>engages with the stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the corner portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is provided on the outer peripheral surface side of the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which turns around an axis <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the base portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> when the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is pulled out, and the stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is provided in a portion facing the outer peripheral surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, the installation of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with an attachment face element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for installing the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In a substantially central portion of the attachment face element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a concave portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>recessed to the cabin side (front side of the figure) is provided to secure a space for inserting a hand when the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is operated. Further, the attachment face element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed with square holes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, before the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is installed to the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, first, the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pulled out of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> against the urging force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), and then the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is tilted through angle A with respect to the ordinarily installed case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>indicated by the two-dot chain line to form a temporarily held case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>indicated by the solid line. The arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>engages with the stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on the wall portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, since the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in this state is pulled toward the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by the urging force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), the engagement force between the corner portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>increases, so that the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is kept in an open state even if worker&apos;s hold of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is lost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The reason why this state is established before the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is installed to the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is as described below. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, since the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is not formed so large enough as compared with dimension L1 of the mechanism section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> plus the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> must be inserted into the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>so that the mechanism section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> passes through the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>while the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is tilted slightly and the angle thereof is changed. Thereupon, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, if the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is made in a state of being pulled out, the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> tilts, so that dimension L2 of the mechanism section plus the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>becomes smaller than dimension L1. Therefore, merely by slightly changing the angle at the time of insertion into the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the mechanism section can be caused to pass through the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, so that the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> does not interfere with the mechanism section, and thus the speed of assembling work can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The reason why the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is not formed so large enough is as described below. The width dimension (dimension in the vertical direction of vehicle) of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is determined considering the ease of grip. Considering the balance of design, the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> cannot be made much larger than the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. If possible, the width of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is made equal to that of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, that is, the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is made narrow in width. For this reason, the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>which is covered with the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> cannot be so large enough as compared with dimension L1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is pulled out of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the state in which the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is not installed to the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is tilted through a certain angle with respect to the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as compared with the state in which the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is installed to the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> engages with the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to keep a pulled-out state. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the insertion into the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is made easy, so that the mechanism section can be inserted into the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Thus, after the base portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted into the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the mechanism section mainly consisting of the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are inserted into the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in the above-described temporarily held state, the back face of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is still tilted through angle A, and when the tilt of the back face of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is returned and the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is set so as to be aligned with the surface of the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the corner portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comes off the stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and thus the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is made in a closed state by the urging force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Specifically, before the mechanism section is caused to pass through the square hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is kept in an opened state. However, at the time when the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is installed to the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and angle A between the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> becomes zero so that the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>cannot be held temporarily, the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made in a closed state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, two screw holes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>formed in the attachment face element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and internal threads <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are aligned and tightened by screws <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, by which the fixation of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is completed. Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the rod <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the door latch <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is connected to the clip <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Thus, by fixing the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the screws <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, after assembling, the angle of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is kept in a set state, that is, zero, and the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is not made in the state of being tilted through angle A. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, at the time of the ordinary operation of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>does not lie on a path through which the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is brought in and out, so that the stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are located in positions in which they do not interfere with each other, and thus the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> does not engage with the stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>after assembling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The operation of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> after assembling will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</cross-reference> show a state before the handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is pulled out, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 14</cross-reference> show a state of handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having been pulled out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, by pulling out the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is turned around the axis <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the base portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and projects in the outside direction of F1 (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). By this operation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>projecting from the back face of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the cabin side is moved in the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and thereby a tip end portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is pushed. If the pushing force exceeds the urging force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the direction of Y (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>), the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> turns in the direction of X (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) around the pin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. By this turning of the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the rod <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> fixed to the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by the clip <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is pushed down in the direction of Z (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>), whereby the door latch <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> This embodiment, which is configured as described above, achieves the following effects: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> (1) Since the construction is such that the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> makes angle A horizontally with respect to the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and is held by utilizing the force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the bell crank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the counterweight <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which constitute the mechanism section of the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, can be inserted without a special force while the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is kept in a pulled-out state, so that the efficiency of assembling work increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> (2) Since a separate stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is not used unlike the conventional construction, there is no work for installing the stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and work for removing the stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> after the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is installed to the door <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is eliminated. Also, there is no need for providing a place at which the removed stopper <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is stored at the side of the vehicle body assembling line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> (3) Since the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is constructed so that the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> itself has functions, even when the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is removed from the door outer panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be reused, and special tools and jigs are not needed in a general servicing environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> (4) Since the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a construction such as not to interfere with other parts in a state of being installed to the door <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and is not a large-sized structure, the influence on the strength is little, and the influence on the collision performance is kept to a minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> (5) Since the stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is provided on the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> unlike the conventional construction, so that the stopper portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>can be molded integrally with the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and the construction is simple, the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be manufactured at a low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> (6) Since an element need not be added, the function can be performed by almost the same weight as compared with the case of the original shape. Therefore, the construction of this embodiment contributes to a reduction in weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> (7) Since the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be kept in a pulled-out state merely by lightly pressing the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, there is no need for reducing the reaction force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and the setting of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can have a degree of freedom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, as described above, there is provided means for temporarily holding the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in a pulled-out state against the urging force of the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> without relying on the human power of worker when the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is assembled. The present invention is not limited to this embodiment, and the outside handle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be used not only for a side door but also a back door. Also, it can be used for a vehicle having one side door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Next, various modifications will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference>. In a first modification shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, convex portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(protruding portions) are provided on the inside of the wall portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> so as to face each other, and concave portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are provided in the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this modification, when the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is fully opened (pulled out to the maximum), the convex portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>engages with the concave portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, by which a temporarily holding function is secured. Also, in the ordinary handle operating state, the convex portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> serves to support the sliding motion of the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In a second modification shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, in the case where the tilt direction of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with respect to the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is vertical, the tip end of the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> engages with a step portion of a convex portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>formed on the upper inside face (face extending substantially in parallel with the lengthwise direction of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Specifically, by pulling out the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and tilting it around the lengthwise axis thereof, the tip end of the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>engages with the convex portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In the ordinary handle operating state, the convex portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the case portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> serves to support the sliding motion of the arm portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the grip portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
