<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> A subject of the present invention is an apparatus for choking the control stage of a steam turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect, a subject of the present invention is a steam turbine, especially for geothermal applications. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As is known, geothermal power stations exploit the endogenous heat of the earth to produce the steam that will directly or indirectly feed the steam turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In particular, various cycles may be adopted for using the abovementioned steam, which cycles in the present case may be summarized as follows: turbines fed with indirect steam produced by means of heat exchangers, turbines fed with steam originating directly from the geothermal well, and finally turbines fed with what is known as &ldquo;flashed&rdquo; steam, meaning turbines in which the steam originating from the well is introduced into a water tank from which the steam for feeding the turbine is taken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the present invention relates to cycles of the second type or turbines fed with steam originating directly from the geothermal well. In such cases, the geothermal well is fed with water to achieve the necessary production of steam, a balance always being preserved between the conflicting requirements of feeding the turbines and &ldquo;cultivating&rdquo; the geothermal well. In such conditions, it is clear that the production of steam from the subsoil does not guarantee a flow rate and a pressure that are constant over time. Specifically, if the flow rate is kept constant, for example, the pressure may vary substantially in the course of a few months, with the consequence that on any change in pressure the sections of the steam inlet into the nozzles of the turbine would also have to be changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of sizing the inlet sections appropriately, therefore, the pressure and flow-rate conditions of the steam entering the turbine can only be estimated and it will subsequently be necessary to adapt the abovementioned inlet sections in order to obtain the optimum performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition to the abovementioned variations in flow rate and/or pressure inherent in the steam generation system itself, the use of direct steam also influences the said values, thus introducing a further degree of uncertainty into the data for designing the inlet sections of the turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The steam originating directly from the geothermal well contains impurities, such as for example sulphur compounds or silicates, which may create scaling that forms on the inside walls of the turbine and/or cause wear and erosion of the steam passage sections. This phenomenon changes the internal geometry of the turbine and consequently the pressure and flow-rate values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is thus clear that, in order to be able to adapt the inlet sections of the turbine to the requirements resulting from the variability of the inlet flow rate and/or pressure, there is a very evident need to change the number of nozzles of the first stage through which the steam passes, increasing it when the pressure falls and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For this purpose, it is known to shut down the turbine, gain access to the inner space and directly modify the inlet section of the nozzles, blocking off the necessary number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, it is clear that such a solution suffers from numerous disadvantages, primarily unacceptable machine shutdowns due not only to the time required for the work of blocking off the nozzles but also to the time necessary for cooling and restarting the turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is also known to make such an adjustment in a different manner that makes it possible to operate during the functioning of the turbine and hence to eliminate the abovementioned disadvantages. This arrangement provides for the use of valves fitted to the intake pipe admitting the steam into the turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> This solution also is not free from disadvantages, owing to the fact that the valves have to be fitted to individual pipes that feed groups of nozzles. In this case, specifically, the production of the pipes is complex and costly, and has an adverse effect on the optimum geometry of the intake pipe, inevitably causing additional losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The problem on which the present invention is based is therefore that of proposing an apparatus for the choking of the control stage of a steam turbine, and a steam turbine that possesses structural and functional characteristics such as to satisfy the abovementioned requirements and, at the same time, to overcome the disadvantages cited with reference to the known art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With reference to the abovementioned figures, the reference <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been used to designate a steam turbine, in particular for geothermal applications, which in its more general structure possesses technical features that are substantially known in the industry and, as such, will be mentioned only briefly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows diagrammatically the plant into which the turbine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fitted, corresponding to what is known as a direct steam cycle. The reference <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been used to designate a geothermal well fed in a manner such as to obtain steam that is passed directly to the turbine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The latter is conventionally formed by a rotor, or impeller, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, mounted in a shell <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and associated with a generator, designated <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The reference <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been used to designate a steam inlet section from which a feed pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the said turbine runs. Having passed through the latter, the flow of steam passes through a final section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the said pipe, structured in the form of a circular ring coaxial with the rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The feed pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which extends from the abovementioned inlet section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the abovementioned final section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, defines the internal geometry of the turbine in the steam inlet zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Facing this final section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> defining a first stage for action of the turbine. This final section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> thus represents the feed section for feeding the abovementioned nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The impeller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extends conventionally in the radial direction in rings of blades, of which the blades of the first stage of the turbine have been designated by the reference <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> An apparatus for the choking of the control stage of the said turbine, designated as a whole by the reference <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is advantageously provided in alignment with the nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the first stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> This apparatus comprises closure means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for closing at least one of the nozzles of the first stage of the turbine, an example of embodiment of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Specifically, this figure shows a transverse section through the turbine taken at the level of the feed pipe and in which three mobile walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are shown, forming part of the abovementioned closure means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the plan shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the said walls are configured in the form of a sector of a circular ring which extends through an angular sector equal to the angular extension of a predetermined number of nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. It is particularly advantageous to provide, as in the example shown, a first wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which extends through an angular sector Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> equal to the angular extension of two nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a second wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which extends through an angular sector X equal to the angular extension of four nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and finally a third wall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>which extends through an angular sector Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> equal to the angular extension of eight nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The abovementioned individual sectors of nozzles are defined by delimitation elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, in the form of small columns or sectors disposed radially relative to the final section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the feed pipe. These small columns further define a sliding track for the abovementioned walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The presence of the said sectors Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and X of varying extent makes it possible to obtain optimum adaptation of the possibilities of adjustment, as will be shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As regards the distribution of the three abovementioned sectors Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and X, the latter may be contiguous or otherwise, as in the case shown. This distribution depends, for example, on the presence of sectors or arcs of larger nozzles choked inside the turbine, as for example the sector designated A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the example shown, this sector A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is equal to a sector corresponding to twenty-two nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Along the extension of the circular ring corresponding to the nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the first stage, then, are defined arcs or angular sectors of nozzles, on which action can be taken in different ways in order to obtain a choking that permits the better adaptation of the geometry of the turbine to the steam pressure and flow-rate conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a linear development of the nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and of their subdivision into sectors defined not only by the references given above (X, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) but also by the further references A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The upper portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the development of the upper half of the nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, while the lower portion shows the development of the lower half of the nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In the subdivision between lower half and upper half, the arc A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shown partly in the upper half and partly in the lower half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The arcs or sectors A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> represent an equivalent number of steam intake sectors which, when the machine is shut down, can be closed by means of closure elements fixed and predetermined as a function of the intended configuration, or of the pressure estimated at the intake. In the example shown, the arc A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponds to a sector equal to twenty-two nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, while the arc corresponding to the sum of the arc B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the arc B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is equal to twenty-eight nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The arcs or sectors X, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, by contrast, represent an equivalent number of steam intake sectors which can be closed or opened as a function of the position assumed by the abovementioned mobile walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>actuated by control means <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> during the functioning of the machine. The progressive and combined closure of the abovementioned walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>covers a broad range of possibilities that extends from a minimum value of two nozzles to a maximum value of fourteen nozzles, obtained when all the walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the example shown, the sector named A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is always open and the opening, in order, of the sectors Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, X makes it possible to maintain a continuous intake arc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Also present in the example shown are a sector C, corresponding to an arc of four closed nozzles, and a sector D of approximately 15&deg;, interposed between the arc X and the arc B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and corresponding to an arc of four nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The abovementioned control means <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are structured in a manner such as to cause the closure means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and in particular the walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, to assume at least one position of rest and one working position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the position of rest, the walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are positioned in a circular ring further out than that corresponding to the nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and do not interfere with the flow of steam within the feed pipe or influence the optimum geometry of the latter (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the working position, the walls are disposed to close the respective sector of nozzles in the vicinity of the final section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the feed pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this position, each of the walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is delimited by a stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, or lower guide, disposed tangentially relative to the final section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the feed pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and is also in contact with the delimitation elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the inlet section of the respective sector of nozzles. Each of the walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>thus comprises a closure surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is positioned behind the final section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the feed pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and corresponding to the inlet section of the corresponding sector of nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The abovementioned walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>thus define, in the working position, a break in continuity interposed between the feed pipe and the corresponding nozzles. This break in continuity is directly facing the inlet section of the corresponding sector of nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The control means <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are structured in a manner such as to cause each of the walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to translate in a direction of displacement parallel to the closure surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the said wall. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each direction of displacement corresponds to a radial direction relative to the final section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the feed pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the control means <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> comprise, for each of the walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, a connecting element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> operationally associated with the closure means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and provided with an end that extends outside the turbine. This connecting element is produced in the form of a rod having one end solidly fixed to the corresponding wall, movable along its own axis and provided with seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> produced in the form of rings. This connecting element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be associated with a manual wheel outside the turbine, in a manner such as to be capable of actuation during the functioning of the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The wheel control system is removable in that blocking means <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are also provided to retain the closure means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the working position. These blocking means comprise a nut/counternut system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> screwed onto the rod <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to span a plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> defining the base of a frame <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> inserted coaxially with the rod <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A locking pin <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is inserted into a channel <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to prevent the latter from rotating about its axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A description is given below of the method of use of the closure means described above and of the control means described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As a function of the pressure/flow-rate value desire at the inlet of the turbine, the number of nozzles through which the passage of steam is allowed is adjusted. In particular, in order to reduce the pressure (and increase the flow rate) the nozzles of a particular sector are opened progressively, causing the corresponding wall to translate from the working position into the position of rest. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, all the walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are shown, for example, in the position of rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> For this purpose, the wheel control is actuated, causing the available sectors to open in sequence in order to achieve a high degree of precision and graduation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Conversely, in order to increase the pressure (and reduce the flow rate) the wheel control is actuated causing the respective wall to translate from the position of rest into the working position. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows one of the walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>disposed in the working position, with the corresponding nozzles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> This position is ensured by the blocking means <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In particular, the frame <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is inserted and the nut/counternut system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is secured. The insertion of the locking pin <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> prevents the rod <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from rotating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> From the above, it will be appreciated that the provision of movable walls which, in the working position, act directly to close the final section of the feed pipe makes it possible to meet the abovementioned requirements. In particular, the advantageous configuration of a choking apparatus according to the present invention makes it possible to eliminate the unacceptable machine shutdowns necessary to install and remove fixed closures, making it possible to operate from outside the turbine when the latter is in operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, this configuration makes it possible to maintain the optimum geometry of the feed pipe unaltered, avoiding structural complications and hence keeping both size and costs within limits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It is clear that alternative embodiments and/or additions are possible to what has been described above and illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As an alternative, and as shown in the figures, the number, shape, dimensions or configurations of the walls provided may be different, for example depending on contiguous nozzle sectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The control means may also be different, for example providing directions of displacement of the walls that may be either linear, as provided in the example shown, or curved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> To replace the manual wheel, alternative embodiments may be provided, comprising, for example, an electrical, pneumatic or hydraulic actuator. These systems permit the remote or automatic manoeuvring of the choking apparatus according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the preferred form of embodiment of the apparatus and turbine described above, a person skilled in the art, in order to meet contingent and specific requirements, may make numerous modifications, adjustments or replacements of elements with others that are functionally equivalent, without thereby departing from the scope of the claims that follow. </paragraph>
