<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method of and a device for detecting the amount of ink in the ink fountain in a printer such as a stencil printer, and more particularly to such a method and a device in which the amount of ink is detected on the basis of the oscillation frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There has been known a printer such as a stencil printer in which ink is supplied to an ink fountain in a printing drum by an ink pump from an exchangeable ink container. In such a printer, the amount of ink in the ink fountain is detected by an ink sensor and when the ink in the ink fountain is consumed to a predetermined amount, the ink pump is operated to replenish the ink fountain with the ink from the ink container in order to keep constant the amount of ink in the ink fountain. (See, for instance, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 60(1985)-193687) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As a method of detecting the amount of ink, there has been proposed a method in which the tip of a needle antenna connected to an oscillator is dipped in the ink and the amount of the ink is detected on the basis of the oscillation frequency of the oscillator which varies with the depth to which the antenna is dipped in the ink. (See, for instance, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 58(1983)-62520) With this method, since as the depth to which the antenna is dipped in the ink increases, the electrostatic capacity around the antenna increases and the oscillation frequency of the oscillator lowers, the amount of ink in the ink fountain can be kept constant by replenishing the ink fountain with the ink so that the oscillation frequency detected becomes constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, the oscillation frequency also depends upon the dielectric constant of the ink, and when the ink is small in dielectric constant, change of the oscillation frequency is small, which makes it difficult to detect change of the oscillation frequency with change of the amount of ink in the ink fountain. To the contrast, when the ink is large in dielectric constant, unnecessary radiation increases and the accuracy in detecting the change of the oscillation frequency is deteriorated. When detection of change of the oscillation frequency with change of the amount of ink in the ink fountain is difficult or the accuracy in detecting the change of the oscillation frequency is deteriorated, it becomes impossible to keep constant the amount of ink in the ink fountain and as a result, quality of the printed image deteriorates. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing observations and description, the primary object of the present invention is to provide a method of and a device for detecting the amount of ink which can properly detect change of the oscillation frequency irrespective of the dielectric constant of the ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of detecting the amount of ink in an ink fountain in a printer on the basis of change of oscillation frequency wherein the improvement comprises </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> the step of changing the oscillation frequency on the basis of dielectric constant information on the dielectric constant of the ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The dielectric constant information may represent the dielectric constant of the ink itself, or may represent other factors such as the viscosity of the ink, the color of the ink, the time for which the ink is left to stand and the date of production of the ink on the basis of which the dielectric constant of the ink can be calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The dielectric constant information may be obtained by measuring the dielectric constant of the ink or may be obtained from an information storage means attached to the ink bottle for supplying ink to the ink fountain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As the information storage means, for instance, a nonvolatile memory (e.g., an EEPROM) which can hold data for a predetermined time interval without supplying power. This applicant has proposed a system for variously controlling a printer on the basis of information stored in such an information storage means attached to consumables like an ink bottle. See Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-18507. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further the dielectric constant information may be input through an input means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a device for detecting the amount of ink in an ink fountain in a printer on the basis of change of oscillation frequency wherein the improvement comprises </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> a frequency changing means which changes the oscillation frequency on the basis of dielectric constant information on the dielectric constant of the ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The frequency changing means may be arranged to obtain the dielectric constant information by measuring the dielectric constant of the ink and to change the oscillation frequency on the basis of the dielectric constant information thus obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further, the frequency changing means may be arranged to change the oscillation frequency on the basis of dielectric constant information provided from an information storage means attached to the ink bottle for supplying ink to the ink fountain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The device may further comprises an input means so that the frequency changing means changes the oscillation frequency on the basis of the dielectric constant information input through the input means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, since the oscillation frequency is changed on the basis of the dielectric constant information, the change of the oscillation frequency can be easily detected by increasing the oscillation frequency when the ink is small in dielectric constant and, unnecessary radiation can be suppressed and the accuracy in detecting the change of the oscillation frequency can be improved by decreasing the oscillation frequency when the ink is large in dielectric constant, whereby change of the oscillation frequency can be accurately detected and the amount of ink in the ink fountain can be accurately detected irrespective of the dielectric constant of the ink, which makes it feasible to keep constant the amount of ink in the ink fountain and to obtain high quality images.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> stencil printer comprises a printing drum <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> around which a master <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is wound. An ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is disposed inside the printing drum <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to rotate about a rotary shaft <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow A in contact with the inner peripheral surface of the printing drum <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby supplying ink to the printing drum <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A doctor roller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is disposed in the vicinity of the ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to control the amount of ink supplied to the outer peripheral surface of the ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The doctor roller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with respect to the ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a space t intervening therebetween. An ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed at the contact area of the ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the doctor roller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. An ink supply mechanism <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> supplies ink to the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by a ink supply pump (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When passing through the space t between the ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the doctor roller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in response to rotation of the ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the ink in the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> adheres to the outer peripheral surface of the ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to form an ink layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of a uniform thickness. As the ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> rotates, the ink layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is conveyed to the contact area of the ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the printing drum <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and transferred to the inner peripheral surface of the printing drum <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, the ink transferred to the inner peripheral surface of the printing drum <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passes through the printing drum <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> under the pressure of the ink coater roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and is transferred to a printing paper <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through the master <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The amount of ink in the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is detected by an ink amount detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the ink amount detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a receiver circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a detector circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, an amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a comparator circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and an antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With reference to also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is an LC resonance circuit having a winding and a capacitor and the oscillation frequency from the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be controlled by changing the bias of a variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A. The control signal for changing the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A is input from the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The receiver circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a kind of tuning circuit and generates a harmonic signal when it receives a signal of a particular frequency and is tuned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Since ink is larger than air in dielectric constant, the electrostatic capacity of the capacitor of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> increases as the amount of ink in the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> increases, and vice versa. Accordingly, in order to keep the amount of ink in the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> constant at a predetermined amount, the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is controlled so that a signal of a frequency corresponding to the predetermined amount is oscillated, and the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is set to be tuned to the frequency of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The detector circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> converts the frequency signal generated by the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a DC voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> amplifies the DC voltage output from the detector circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The comparator circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> compares the value of the signal output from the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a reference value. When the value of the signal output from the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is not smaller than the reference value, the comparator circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generates an ON-signal to turn on a switching circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Whereas when the value of the signal output from the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is smaller than the reference value, the comparator circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generates an OFF-signal to turn off the switching circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The switching circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is for controlling the ink supply pump (not shown) and only when the switching circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is on, the ink supply pump supplies ink to the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> reads out information representing the kind of ink stored in a memory <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> attached to the ink bottle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and generates a control signal for setting the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with reference to a table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) representing the relation between the kind of the ink and the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A (based on the dielectric constant according to the kind of ink). Bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A to cause the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to oscillate at a frequency optimal to the dielectric constant of the ink is calculated in advance for each of a plurality of kinds of ink and the kind of ink is related to the calculated bias in the table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided with a connector <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A which is connected to a circuit board <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on which the memory <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is mounted and reads out the kind of the ink stored in the memory <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the ink bottle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is set in the stencil printer and the circuit board <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is connected to the connector <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A, the kind of the ink stored in the memory <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is readout. The detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is also connected to a display panel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and determination in processing performed by the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is displayed on the display panel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Operation of the stencil printer will be described, hereinbelow. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the processing to be performed by the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The detecting circuit first determines whether an ink bottle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has been set in the stencil printer. (steps S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) When it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that an ink bottle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has been set in the stencil printer, the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> reads out ink information representing the kind of the ink in the ink bottle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from a memory <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> attached to the ink bottle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. (step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) When it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that an ink bottle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has not been set in the stencil printer, a display to call upon the operator to set an ink bottle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is made on the display panel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. (step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) Steps S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are repeated until an ink bottle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> After reading out the ink information, the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> refers to the table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B and determines whether the kind of the ink read out is in the table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B. (step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) When it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that the kind of the ink read out is in the table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B, the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> gets bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A corresponding to the kind of the ink from the table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B (step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>), and outputs a control signal corresponding to the bias to the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). Whereas when it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that the kind of the ink read out is not in the table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B, an error message such as &ldquo;The kind of ink is not good&rdquo; is displayed on the display panel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) and the bias is set to a default value (step S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Then the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sets the oscillation frequency according to the bias represented by the control signal. (step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> oscillates at an oscillation frequency thus set. When ink exists in the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the tip of the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is in contact with the ink, the dielectric constant of the ink increases the electrostatic capacity and the oscillation frequency at which the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> actually oscillates becomes lower than the oscillation frequency set by the control signal from the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. At this time, since the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not tuned to the oscillation frequency of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the output voltage from the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> becomes lower than when the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is tuned to the oscillation frequency of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the value of the signal output from the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is smaller than the reference value and the comparator circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generates an off signal, whereby the switching circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned off. In this state, the ink supply pump is not operated and no ink is supplied to the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> To the contrast, when the ink in the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is consumed and the tip of the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> comes to be away from the ink, the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> oscillates at the oscillation frequency set by the control signal from the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. At this time, the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is tuned to the oscillation frequency of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and outputs a harmonic signal at a high voltage. Accordingly, the value of the signal output from the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is not smaller than the reference value and the comparator circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generates an on signal, whereby the switching circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned on. In this state, the ink supply pump is operated and ink is supplied to the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from the ink bottle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Then, when the amount of ink in the fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is increased and the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the ink again, the ink pump is stopped, whereby the amount of ink in the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is kept constant during printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the stencil printer, since the oscillation frequency of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is changed according to the kind of the ink or the dielectric constant of the ink, the change of the oscillation frequency can be easily detected by increasing the oscillation frequency when the ink is small in dielectric constant and, unnecessary radiation can be suppressed and the accuracy in detecting the change of the oscillation frequency can be improved by decreasing the oscillation frequency when the ink is large in dielectric constant. Accordingly, change of the oscillation frequency can be accurately detected and the amount of ink in the ink fountain can be accurately detected irrespective of the dielectric constant of the ink, which makes it feasible to keep constant the amount of ink in the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and to obtain high quality images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Though, in the first embodiment described above, the table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B represents the relation between the kind of ink and the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A, the table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B may be arranged to represent the relation between the dielectric constant of ink and the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A when the ink information stored in the memory <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> represents the dielectric constant of the ink. Further, when the ink information stored in the memory <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> represents another factor such as the viscosity of the ink, the color of the ink, the time for which the ink is left to stand or the date of production of the ink which can affect the dielectric constant of the ink, the table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>B may be arranged to represent the relation between such a factor and the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the structure of an ink amount detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. The ink amount detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; of this embodiment differs from the ink amount detecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment in that a control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which measures the dielectric constant of the ink and outputs a control signal for changing the oscillation frequency of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the measured dielectric constant of the ink is provided in place of the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> outputs a control signal which sets the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that the value of the signal output from the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> becomes equal to a reference value and the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> oscillates at the frequency at which the value of the signal output from the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> becomes equal to the reference value. Since the output signal of the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is an analog signal, the control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is provided with an A/D convertor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Operation of the second embodiment will be described with reference to the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, hereinbelow. In the second embodiment, the depth to which the antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is dipped in the ink fountain <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is set to a predetermined default value. A control signal for setting the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to an initial value is first output to the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. (step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) This causes the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to oscillate at the default oscillation frequency, whereby the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> outputs an output signal and the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> amplifies the output signal and inputs the amplified output signal into the control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. (step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) Then whether the output signal is equal to the reference value is determined. (step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) When it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> that the output signal is equal to the reference value, the control signal is set to provide the bias at that time. (step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) Otherwise, the control signal is changed to change the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) and then step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are repeated until the output signal becomes equal to the reference value. Steps S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are repeated until the output signal becomes equal to the reference value in a predetermined time interval. When the output signal does not become equal to the reference value in the predetermined time interval, an error message to the effect that it is impossible to detect the amount of ink is displayed on the display panel <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Though the oscillation frequency of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is changed by setting the bias of the variable capacitance diode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A of the oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the detecting circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment and by the control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment, the oscillation frequency may be changed by manually inputting a desired oscillation frequency through a keyboard or a control panel. </paragraph>
