<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present application claims priority from U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/301,814, filed July 2, 2001.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Printed pages may be bound into a book using various methods, for example, using a hot-melt adhesive. In this method, a hot-melt adhesive may be applied to an inner surface of a central portion of a cover or to a spine of a book block. The cover may then be positioned such that the inner surface of its central portion abuts the spine. Heat and pressure may be applied to the contact area to cause the cover and the spine to adhere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> When heat is applied to the hot-melt adhesive, the substance changes from a high to a low viscous state. When the adhesive is in the low viscous state, pressure may be applied to the spine area causing the adhesive to spread out over the desired location, adhering to the pages and cover. Once the adhesive has cooled, the adhesive returns to its original high viscous state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> If the adhesive is not sufficiently heated, the viscosity does not become low enough, and the adhesive may not spread between the pages. On the other hand, if the adhesive is over heated, the viscosity of the adhesive may become too low, and the adhesive may run off into undesired locations. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, elements shown in the figures have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements may be exaggerated relative to other elements for clarity.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Some embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method for bookbinding. A hot-melt adhesive tape having layers with different viscous properties in the melted state is used. The tape may be positioned between a spine of a book block and an inner surface of a central portion of a book cover such that a layer having a high-viscosity hot-melt adhesive substance may be positioned next to the cover and a layer having a low-viscosity hot-melt adhesive may be positioned next to the spine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is a schematic illustration of a hot-melt adhesive tape according to some embodiments of the present invention. In the exemplary configuration, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> hot-melt adhesive tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may comprise a first adhesive layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a second adhesive layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The widths of layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may vary according to the application&apos;s requirements. However, it should be noted that tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may have a different configuration, such as, for example, having at least another adhesive or non-adhesive layer in between layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Adhesive layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise a high-viscosity hot-melt adhesive substance. Adhesive layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may comprise a low-viscosity hot-melt adhesive substance. When heated to a high temperature, such as, for example, between 80&deg; C. and 200&deg; C., the viscosity of the adhesive substance of layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be, for example, 5000 CPS. When heated to a high temperature, such as, for example, between 80&deg; C. and 200&deg; C. the viscosity of the adhesive substance of layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be, for example, 1900-2250 CPS. At room temperature, the viscosity of the adhesive substances of both layers may be similar. In some alternative embodiments, the viscosity of the adhesive substance of layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be different from that of layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also at room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> When the high-viscosity hot-melt adhesive substance is heated, it remains highly viscous and therefore practically immobile in comparison to a low-viscosity hot-melt adhesive substance that when heated becomes fluid and tends to flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The low-viscosity adhesive substance may be selected according to desired properties, such as, for example, viscosity, penetration properties, wetting properties, binding temperature and speed. Typically, tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be in a form of a roll (not shown) having a width that is generally equal to the length of the pages of a book block being bound. Tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is cut to a desired size at the time of use. Generally, the size to which tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is cut when binding is substantially equal to the width of the spine of the book block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This is especially useful in a book machine or other made-to-order printing/binding machine by winch the pages are printed and/or collated at a store or an office location. In such a situation, once the pages are collated and the eventual width of the stack is known, the strip of adhesive tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then cut to the appropriate width. An example of such a machine is described in WO 01/56794 to the common assignee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is a schematic illustration of a book having a hot-melt adhesive tape according to some embodiments of the present invention. An exemplary book <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, having a plurality of pages <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> aligned into a book block having a spine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a cover having a central portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, is described. A strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of hot-melt adhesive tape <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, described hereinabove with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, may be placed between an inner surface of central portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and spine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> causing them to adhere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> By using different viscosity layers, adhesive strip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may enable adhesion to both the cover and the pages such that layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, being of higher viscosity when heated, may adhere to central portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the cover book without leakage. The adhesive substance of layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, being of lower viscosity than that of layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when heated may spread into the pages to afford adequate adhesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> While certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes, and equivalents will now occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
