<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a door handle for a vehicle which mounts a sensor electrode for detecting the presence of a person in a door handle of an automobile, and more particularly to a door handle adapted to be used in a vehicle and having a slit in which a sensor electrode is disposed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As one of theft prevention (security) systems for a vehicle, there has been proposed a system in which a driver of the vehicle (specified person) carries a portable unit (remote controller) having a function of opening or closing a door and the transmission and the reception of radio wave signals are performed between the portable unit and the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In this system, when the system detects that the driver approaches the vehicle, the authentication or identification whether the driver is the authorized driver or not (authentication or identification based on the transmission and the reception of an authentication code) is performed. Then, when it is authenticated that the driver is the authorized driver, a door lock device is operated so as to perform the door unlocking operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Examples of such a vehicle theft prevention system are disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 308149/1998 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 160897/2000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the prior art disclosed in the previously-mentioned Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 308149/1998, the system detects the approaching of a driver to a vehicle by a signal based on the change of electrostatic capacitance. This operation is performed by a structure in which a hollow space is formed inside an outside door handle made of synthetic resin and an equilibrium cable for detecting electrostatic capacitance is housed in a hollow portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A drawback of this prior art lies in that a sensor electrode (equilibrium cable) is housed in the hollow portion of the resin handle and hence, the capacitance of the sensor electrode is remarkably changed when water enters the hollow portion so that it is difficult to discriminate this change from a change of capacitance which is generated when a person approaches the vehicle. Accordingly, a waterproof structure is indispensable in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, since HOT and GND of the sensor electrode is arranged in the inside of the outside handle, the system does not function when the material of the outside door handle is not made of resin material. That is, there arises a fear that the material of the outside door handle is limited. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a door handle for vehicle which can solve the above-mentioned drawbacks of the prior art. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To solve the above-mentioned drawbacks, the present invention adopts means in which a slit opening at a door-side surface of a door handle body is formed in a door handle body and a sensor electrode covered with a synthetic resin mold is housed in the slit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Due to such means, it is possible to generate the electrostatic capacitance which can be used as the reference for change of electrostatic capacitance for detecting the presence of a person between the sensor electrode and a door panel. Accordingly, even if a door handle body is formed of metal or material which is produced by applying metal plating on synthetic resin material, the sensor electrode can be used as a sensor for detecting the presence of the person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, since the sensor electrode is arranged in the inside of the slit in a form that the sensor electrode is covered with the synthetic resin, no particular waterproof structure is necessary and an erroneous detection caused by moisture, dust or the like can be eliminated. Further, the sensor electrode is not influenced by material which constitutes the door handle body and hence, the required detection characteristics can be sufficiently ensured.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of a door handle for vehicle according to a present invention are explained in detail in conjunction with attached drawings hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is constituted of a metal-made door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is disposed in an opening portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> located at a rear side of a door outer panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and having a hollow portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> therein and a cover <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> made of synthetic resin which closes the hollow portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The cover <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is mounted on the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by snap-fitting a plurality of projections (not shown) which are formed on the cover <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> into holes (not shown) which are formed in the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Further, the cover <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured to the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> using small screws or welding. As such fixing means, usually available fixing means can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes an arm <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is extended into the inside of the door outer panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at a front side thereof, while the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with a key cylinder casing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a bell crank body <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which is cooperatively coupled with a link mechanism (not shown) of a door lock device at a rear side thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> made of metal assumes a state in which the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is brought into electric contact with the door outer panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When a driver wants to bring the vehicle door into an opened state, the driver puts his hand into a recessed portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the outer panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the vehicle door and grips a grip portion of the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The driver then rotates the rear portion of the vehicle door toward outside the vehicle about a distal end portion of the arm <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (in the counterclockwise direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) thus bringing the vehicle door into the opened state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the driver wants to close the vehicle door, the driver pushes the vehicle door in the direction opposite to the opening direction so that the vehicle door is brought into a closed state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a back view of the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as viewed from the door outer panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plurality of slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are preferably formed in a back surface (a surface which faces the door side) of the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at the door outer panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side, wherein the slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are extended in the longitudinal direction. The slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are configured such that the hollow portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is communicated with the outside of the vehicle through the slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although two slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are formed in the illustrated example, the number of slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be three or more. It is preferable to set the width of the slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to equal to or more than 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is covered with a synthetic resin mold <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is arranged in the slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Since the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is covered with the synthetic resin mold <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, there is no possibility that foreign materials such as raindrops, dust or the like directly adhere to the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, there is no change of electric capacitance which may be generated by adhesion of foreign materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated example, the width of the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is set to 1 mm and the width of the slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is set to 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is comprised of a U-shaped portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is positioned in the inside of the slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is opened upwardly and front and rear horizontal portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which are extended from both ends of the U-shaped portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the frontward and backward directions in the hollow portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Distal end portions of the front and rear horizontal portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are extended over the resin mold <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and are welded to harnesses <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by soldering. The resin mold <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is constituted of a portion disposed in the slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and portions which are extended along an inner surface of the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The resin mold <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the inside thereof may be pushed into the slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, in a state that the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed in the inside of the slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, resin is filled in the slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by injection molding thus forming the resin mold <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A radio wave transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which transmits signals to a person who performs an open/close manipulation of the door is arranged in the inside of the hollow portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). In the illustrated drawing, the transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the harness <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are collectively arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> To support the transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, usually available means such as caulking, screws or the like is used. Since the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is arranged at a back surface of the transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is irrelevant to a radio wave direction (vehicle-side direction) from the transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, there is no possibility that the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> adversely affects output signals from the transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As can be understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> major portion of the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is mounted in the inside of a portion of the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> corresponding to a plate thickness which is usually used. Accordingly, to put the present invention into practice, it is unnecessary to increase the thickness of the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a system block diagram when a keyless entry system (that is, a vehicle theft prevention (security) system) is applied to a door open/close device, wherein the keyless entry system enables locking (unlocking) of a vehicle door without using a vehicle key when a driver (an authorized person) has a portable unit called a remote controller and approaches or moves away from the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In this system, the vehicle is provided with two out-vehicle/in-vehicle antennas consisting of a first transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a second transmission antenna <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for performing the communication with the outside of the vehicle, wherein the first transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is arranged in the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mounted on the vehicle door outside the vehicle and the second transmission antenna <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is disposed in an instrument panel disposed in the inside of a vehicle room. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Further, the first transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is connected to a first transmission part <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the second transmission antenna <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is connected to a second transmission part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and both transmission parts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are respectively connected to a controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is in charge of the control of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Further, the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which detects a person approaching the vehicle door and a sensor detection part <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which detects a person based on information from the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are connected to the controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed in the inside of the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transmits a first request signal (out-vehicle request signal) and a second request signal (in-vehicle request signal) respectively to the first transmission part <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the second transmission part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> These signals are modulated and the request signals of 134 kHz, for example, are transmitted from the first transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the second transmission antenna <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to a portable unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which a driver carries at the time of riding on the vehicle as the out-vehicle request signal and the in-vehicle request signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Further, the vehicle is provided with a reception antenna <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The reception antenna <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> receives signals outputted from the portable unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. For example, signals of 300 MHz are transmitted to the reception part <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and are inputted to the controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> after being demodulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a function of storing codes such as a first code for performing door locking, a second code for performing starting of an engine, an ID code of a transponder and the like in the inside of a memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> even when the supply of electricity is interrupted. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the portable unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the system. The portable unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a transmission antenna <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which transmits signals to the vehicle at 300 MHz and a reception antenna <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which receives the ID request signals of 134 kHz transmitted from the vehicle. The transmission antenna <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the reception antenna <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are connected to a transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which is connected to a controller <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> When the reception antenna <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> receives the request signal (out-vehicle request signal) of 134 kHz from a vehicle-mounted unit, the signal is demodulated by the transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and is inputted to the controller <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> transmits the first code and the second code stored in the inside of the memory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The transmission/reception circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> modulates the request signal and transmits the signal of 300 MHz, for example, to the vehicle-mounted unit of the vehicle from the transmission antenna <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> From the first transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the second transmission antenna <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which constitute the vehicle-mounted units, the request signals of the frequency 134 kHz, for example, are transmitted to the portable unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. When the portable unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which the driver carries receives such a request signal, signals of the frequency 300 MHz which are obtained by modulating the first and the second codes in response to the received signals are returned as acknowledgement signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The reception antenna <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is mounted on an inner mirror disposed in the inside of the vehicle and the signals of frequency 300 MHz received by the reception antenna <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are demodulated by the reception circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and are inputted to the controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can receive the first and the second codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> This system is configured to detect the approach of a person carrying the portable unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the vehicle door using the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mounted in the inside of the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, when the driver or the person opens the vehicle door <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to make the vehicle door assume the opened state, the electrostatic capacitance is changed due to the operation of the driver to grip the grip portion of the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (approach of a hand). Accordingly, it is possible to detect that the person is present or the person is about to get on the vehicle in response to the change of the electrostatic capacitance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When the person approaches the vehicle door so as to bring the vehicle door into the opened state, the person extends his hand to the grip portion of the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and grips the grip portion of the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, pulls the grip portion outside the vehicle so as to operate the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the opening direction thus performing the operation to set the vehicle door at the opened state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Here, by setting a line connected to the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at a given oscillation level, that is, in the oscillation state in which the oscillation level is held by an external oscillation circuit, a total electrostatic capacitance C consisting of electrostatic capacitance generated between the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and electrostatic capacitance generated between an infinite extension line with respect to the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fluctuated or changed from the state in which a given oscillation is performed (oscillation level) when the person&apos;s hand approaches the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the hand grips the grip portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this manner, when the hand approaches the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and grips the grip portion, the oscillation level is fluctuated (to high level or low level). Accordingly, in the sensor detection part <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, with respect to the value of the oscillation level which performs the detection that the person is recognized, by presetting a threshold level or by setting the threshold level such that the threshold level is changed in response to the situation, when the oscillation level becomes equal to or more than the threshold level or equal to or less than the threshold level, for example, the determination of the presence of person which sufficiently takes the will of the person who is going to open the vehicle door into account can be realized so that the detection accuracy of the sensor as a person detection sensor can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In this manner, when the door opening operation by the person is detected, the controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> gives a door lock release signal to the door lock part <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in a state that the door is unlocked so that it is possible to automatically unlock the vehicle door <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> without performing the lock/unlocking manipulation using the vehicle key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of a door handle <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the door handle cover <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided at its outer surface with a door lock switch <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which has a conventional structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The switch <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a switch body <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> made of a synthetic resin material and a cover <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> made of a rubber material. A switch mechanism having a moving electric contact <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, stationary opposed electric contacts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and springs <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> to urge the cover <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in one direction is housed in the body <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. When the driver who caries the portable unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> stands outside the vehicle and pushes or operates the door lock switch <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, a signal from the switch <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is transmitted through a wire <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) to the door lock part <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) so as to make the door at the lock state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The door lock body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided with a single slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into which the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sealed by a mold member <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is fitted (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The mold member <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is composed of a resin base member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in which the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is housed and a synthetic resin mold part <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in which the transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is molded. The electric wire <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> extending from the door lock switch <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> runs between the mold part <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the resin base member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The resin base member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is provided with a projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which is formed along the slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and brought into seal contact with the inside of the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> when the mold member <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is fitted into the slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to ensure a water-proof structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The door open/close operation of the second embodiment is the same as that of the first embodiment and hence the description thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As can be understood from the illustrated embodiment, the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is covered with the resin mold <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the major portion of the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is housed in the inside of the slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the door handle body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, no particular seal means is necessary. Further, no particular separate space for accommodating the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> With respect to the number of the slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, provided that the slit causes no problem on the mechanical strength of the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, one slit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for one large sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is sufficient. By adopting a plurality of slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be reversed upside down. Particularly, by arranging two slits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal center axis of the outside door handle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the detection of person can be performed using the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at a fixed detection sensitivity irrespective of the manner of gripping the grip portion by the person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Since the sensor electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed at the back of the transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, there is no fear that the transmission output from the transmission antenna <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
