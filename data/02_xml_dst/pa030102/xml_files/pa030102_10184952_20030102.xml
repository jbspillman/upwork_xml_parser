<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a technology in pedestal level control circuits for video signal processing in a television receiver, etc., more precisely, for pedestal level adjustment, such as brightness adjustment, cutoff adjustment for adjusting white balance of color video images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a conventional television receiver, the pedestal level of a video signal output from a tuner or the like is not always constant. Therefore, for brightness adjustment, the pedestal level is clamped to a predetermined level and then is offset by a predetermined amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when a plurality of video signals are switched for use, for example, when an external video signal is input from external equipment, the adjustment as described above is performed with respect to these video signals to equalize the pedestal levels between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For display of color video images, cutoff adjustment in which the pedestal level is adjusted in the above-described manner for video signals of each of, for example, R, G, and B (red, green, and blue) is performed in order to adjust white balance in accordance with non-uniformity in the emission of a cathode ray tube (CRT). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a conventional pedestal level control circuit for performing the above-described brightness adjustment or cutoff adjustment will be described more specifically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a conventional pedestal level control circuit (brightness adjustment circuit) for adjusting brightness of both internal and external video signals. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> clamp circuit <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> fixes the pedestal level of an internal video signal while being input from, for example, a tuner, to a predetermined level. A clamp circuit <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> fixes the pedestal level of an external video signal while being input from external equipment, to the same level as the internal video signal. A reference voltage source <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> sets the predetermined pedestal level. A switch <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> selects internal video signals or external video signals. An amplifier <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> amplifies an input video signal, and converts, through a load resistor <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a current while being output from a transistor <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into a voltage that the amplifier <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> outputs. A D/A converter <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> converts a digital adjustment data signal that is for brightness adjustment into an analog voltage signal. A brightness adjustment current output circuit <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> converts the analog voltage signal to a current signal and supplies it to the amplifier <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> so that the pedestal level of the video signal output from the amplifier <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is set to a level in accordance with the brightness adjustment data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the pedestal level control circuit having the above-described configuration, the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> both use the same reference voltage source <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, so that the pedestal levels of the internal and external video signals are clamped to the same level to eliminate fluctuations in the pedestal level. Moreover, the brightness adjustment is performed by offsetting the pedestal level in accordance with the brightness adjustment data, based on the pedestal levels of the same level, so that there is no difference in the basic luminance of video images to be displayed, regardless of which the switch <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is directed to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows another conventional pedestal level control circuit (brightness and cutoff adjustment circuit) which has a configuration for performing brightness adjustment and cutoff adjustment with respect to internal and external video signals of three channels of RGB. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, both the reference voltage source <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and the D/A converter <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> are the same as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The clamp circuit <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, the switch <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, and the amplifier <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, each being respectively the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> are provided for each of the R, G, and B video-signal channels. However, in addition to a signal current for brightness adjustment, respective signal currents for cutoff adjustment are input to each amplifier <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. The brightness adjustment current output circuit <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> outputs the signal current for brightness adjustment to the amplifiers <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> for R, G and B. Furthermore, a D/A converter <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and a cutoff adjustment current output circuit <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> are provided. The D/A converter <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> converts a digital data signal for cutoff adjustment for each of R, G, and B to an analog voltage signal, and the cutoff adjustment current output circuit <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> converts the analog voltage signal to a current signal and supplies it to the amplifier <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> so that the pedestal level of the video signal output from each amplifier <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is set to a level in accordance with the brightness adjustment data and the cutoff adjustment data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the pedestal level control circuit having the above-described configuration, as in the circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the pedestal levels for all the R, G, and B and the internal and external video signals are clamped to the same level. Therefore, regarding brightness adjustment, the pedestal levels are offset by an amount in accordance with the brightness adjustment data for all the cases. On the other hand, regarding the cutoff adjustment, the pedestal level is offset by an amount in accordance with the cutoff adjustment data of each corresponding color. Therefore, there is no difference in the luminance of video images to be displayed, regardless of the switching of the switch <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> either to an internal video signal or an external video signal, and white balance suitable for non-uniformity in the emission of a CRT or the like can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional pedestal level control circuits, the clamp circuit is provided for each video signal, so that the circuit scale tends to be large. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform brightness adjustment or cutoff adjustment after clamping the video signal. Therefore, for example, configuring elements or blocks subsequent to the clamp circuit in one IC chip requires input terminals (pins) to which the brightness adjustment signal or the like are input; digital input interfaces; power source circuits and power source terminals of two types for digital and analog signals; and lines between the IC chips (bus lines) or the like. Moreover, in a case in which the brightness adjustment or the like is performed based on digital signal processing and the D/A converter or the like is provided in the vicinity of the clamp circuit or the like, video signals are more susceptible to noise caused by the digital signals. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, with the foregoing in mind, it is an object of the present invention to facilitate a reduction of a circuit scale and to reduce the number of the pins of the IC chip and the number of lines between the IC chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A first pedestal level control circuit of the present invention includes a video data signal output means for outputting a digital video data signal; a pedestal level adjustment data signal output means for outputting a pedestal level adjustment data signal used to generate an analog video signal having a predetermined pedestal level; and a video signal generating means for generating the analog video signal having the predetermined pedestal level based on the video data signal and the pedestal level adjustment data signal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In one preferable embodiment of the first pedestal level control circuit, the video signal generating means includes a digital signal synthesis means for synthesizing the video data signal and the pedestal level adjustment data signal; and a D/A converting means for converting a digital signal synthesized by the digital signal synthesis means to an analog signal to generate the analog video signal having a predetermined pedestal level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one preferable embodiment of the first pedestal level control circuit, the pedestal level adjustment data signal is a brightness adjustment data signal for adjusting a luminance of video images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The pedestal level is adjustable for, for example, brightness adjustment, without a clamp circuit being used, by generating, as described above, an analog video signal having a predetermined pedestal level in the step where signals are digital or in the step where the digital signals are D/A converted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one preferable embodiment of the first pedestal level control circuit, a plurality of sets are provided, each including the video data signal output means, the pedestal level adjustment data signal output means and the video signal generating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one preferable embodiment of the first pedestal level control circuit, three sets are provided, each including the video data signal output means, the pedestal level adjustment data signal output means and the video signal generating means, the three sets corresponding to video images of red, green and blue, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In one preferable embodiment of the first pedestal level control circuit, the pedestal level adjustment data signal is a brightness and cutoff adjustment data signal both for performing brightness adjustment commonly to the video images of the three colors, and for performing cutoff adjustment for video images independently for each color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Also the above preferable embodiments allow brightness adjustment or cutoff adjustment to be performed without a clamp circuit being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a second pedestal level control circuit includes a holding means for holding a predetermined pedestal level of a first video signal; a clamping means for clamping a second video signal such that a pedestal level of the second video signal is equal to the pedestal level of the first video signal that is held; and a switching means for selectively switching the first video signal and the clamped second video signal to output the signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With this embodiment, the pedestal level of the second video signal can be adjusted without a control signal such as a pedestal level adjustment signal. Furthermore, the pedestal level of the first video signal can be held, so that even if the first and the second video signals are asynchronous, the pedestal level can be adjusted by clamping the second video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In one preferable embodiment of the second pedestal level control circuit, the first video signal having a predetermined pedestal level is an analog video signal having a predetermined pedestal level that is generated based on a digital video data signal and a pedestal level adjustment data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Thus, the first video signal having a predetermined pedestal level can be obtained easily, and the pedestal level of the second video signal can be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one preferable embodiment of the second pedestal level control circuit, the video signal generating means outputs an analog signal based on the pedestal level adjustment data signal when the second video signal is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Thus, the analog signal output from the video signal generating means becomes a signal having a constant level in accordance with the pedestal level adjustment data signal, so that even if the first and the second video signals are asynchronous, the pedestal level of the first video signal can be held, and also the second video signal can be clamped at a timing in accordance with the second video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one preferable embodiment of the second pedestal level control circuit, a plurality of sets are provided, each set including the holding means, the clamping means, and the switching means. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Thus, cutoff adjustment can be performed without equalizing the pedestal levels of the second video signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one preferable embodiment of the second pedestal level control circuit, a plurality of sets are provided, each including the clamping means and the switching means, and the clamping means performs a clamping operation based on a pedestal level held by one holding means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one preferable embodiment of the second pedestal level control circuit, three sets are provided, each including the clamping means and the switching means, the three sets corresponding to video images of red, green and blue, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus, cutoff adjustment can be performed without equalizing the pedestal levels of the second vide signals, and only one holding means is sufficient to adjust the pedestal levels of the plurality of second video signals with the pedestal level of the first video signal held by the holding means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for controlling a pedestal level includes the steps of selectively generating a first analog digital signal having a predetermined level based on a digital video data signal and a pedestal level adjustment data signal for adjusting a pedestal level of an analog video signal generated based on the video data signal, or an analog signal having a predetermined signal based on the pedestal level adjustment data signal, holding the predetermined pedestal level of the first analog video signal or the predetermined level of the analog signal, clamping a second analog video signal such that a pedestal level of the second analog video signal is equal to the predetermined pedestal level or the predetermined level that is held, and selectively switching between the first analog video signal and the clamped second analog video signal to output the signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The pedestal level is adjustable in brightness, for example, without using a clamp circuit, by generating a first analog video signal having a predetermined pedestal level in the step where signals are digital or in the step where the digital signals are D/A converted, as described above. Furthermore, the second analog video signal is clamped based on the pedestal level of the first analog video signal, therefore the pedestal level of the second analog video signal is adjustable without a control signal such as a pedestal level adjustment signal. Furthermore, when the analog signal having a predetermined level is selected, the analog signal becomes a signal having a constant level in accordance with the pedestal level adjustment data signal, so that even if the first and the second analog video signals are asynchronous, the pedestal level of the first analog video signal can be held and the second analog video signal can be clamped at a timing in accordance with the second video signal.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an entire configuration of a brightness adjustment circuit that is a single-channel pedestal level control circuit of Embodiment 1 of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this brightness adjustment circuit includes a video data signal output section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (video data signal output means), a brightness adjustment data signal output section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (pedestal level adjustment data signal output means), D/A converters <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (first D/A converter and second D/A converter), an analog signal synthesis circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>(video signal generating means, analog signal synthesis means), and an amplifier <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The video data signal output section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> outputs video data signals that are digital signals. The brightness adjustment data signal output section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> outputs brightness adjustment data signals that are digital signals indicating a brightness adjustment amount. The D/A converters <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> perform D/A conversion of the video data signal and the brightness adjustment data signal, respectively, and output a video signal and a brightness adjustment signal, respectively, that are currents (analog signals) having a magnitude corresponding to these data signals. The analog signal synthesis circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> synthesizes the video signal and the brightness adjustment signal by adding the currents, converts it to a voltage with a resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and outputs the video signal (voltage) that is brightness adjusted. The amplifier <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> amplifies the video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the thus configured brightness adjustment circuit, the D/A converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> outputs a video signal whose pedestal level is in a predetermined reference level, based on the video data signal output from the video data signal output section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The D/A converter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> outputs a brightness adjustment signal of a level corresponding to an offset amount from the pedestal level of the predetermined reference. Then, the video signal and the brightness adjustment signal are synthesized by the analog signal synthesis circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, so that a video signal that is brightness adjusted is output from the amplifier <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and thus a display apparatus such as a CRT or a LCD (liquid crystal display) is driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As described above, the video signal having the predetermined pedestal level that is generated by D/A conversion and brightness adjustment signal are synthesized, so that the video signal that is brightness adjusted can be obtained without the clamp circuit being provided. Therefore, the circuit scale can be reduced easily. Furthermore, the video signal and the brightness signal are synthesized in the step where they are output from the D/A converters <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so that digital signals are separated from analog signals easily, and therefore they are hardly affected by noise. In addition, when brightness adjustment is performed to digital video data or in the step where the digital video data is D/A converted, other video adjustment processing (e.g., reproduction rate adjustment or black scale correction) that are required to be performed based on the uniform pedestal level between R, G and B can be performed collectively before outputting from the video data signal output section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> When converters utilizing current outputs as above are used as the D/A converters <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, signals can be synthesized comparatively easily. In addition, unlike converters utilizing voltage outputs, the signal synthesis is not restricted by the dynamic range between the power source and GND, so that the dynamic range of output signals can be enlarged easily (therefore, it is possible to increase the resolution of D/A (graduation) without limit). However, the present invention is not limited to the converters utilizing current outputs, and also when converters utilizing voltage outputs are used, the advantages of the present invention as described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The video signal and the brightness adjustment signal can be synthesized on the output side of the amplifier <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The video data signal output section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the brightness adjustment data signal output section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are not necessarily provided as separate circuits, and for example, it can be configured such that video signals and brightness adjustment data signals can be output by one microcomputer circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Instead of the analog signal synthesis circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the digital signal synthesis section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (digital signal synthesis means) can be provided to synthesize the video data signal and the brightness adjustment data signal in the step where signals are digital. In this case, it is sufficient to provide one D/A converter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (D/A converting means) that is the same as the D/A converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The digital signal synthesis section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> can be configured with a dedicated circuit or can be configured with, for example, the processing function of a microcomputer. The video data signal output section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the brightness adjustment data signal output section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> also can be configured with the processing function of a microcomputer in combination therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to provide a latch on the output side of the brightness adjustment data signal output section <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or input only one sampling pulse during one frame period or the like so that the amount of brightness adjustment is changed at a timing outside the video display period such as a vertical retrace period. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, as long as the above-described advantages can be obtained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An example of a brightness and cutoff adjustment circuit for performing brightness adjustment and cutoff adjustment with respect to three channel video signals of R, G and B will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The elements having the same function as those in Embodiment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> bear the same reference numerals, and will not be described further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> matrix circuit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> converts, for example, a digital luminance signal Y and color-difference signals R-Y and B-Y to video signals R, G and B of the three primary colors. The video signals R, G and B are input to the D/A converters <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> that are provided corresponding to each color. Brightness and cutoff adjustment data signal output sections <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (pedestal level adjustment data signal output means) output brightness and cutoff adjustment data signals obtained by adding a cutoff adjustment amount for each color for adjusting white balance in accordance with non-uniformity in the emission of the CRT or the like to the brightness adjustment amounts that are equal among them. Other elements such as the D/A converters <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that are the same as those in Embodiment 1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) can be provided for each color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Also in the thus configured brightness and cutoff adjustment circuit, the video signal having the predetermined pedestal level generated by the D/A converter and the brightness and cutoff adjustment signal are synthesized in the same manner as in the brightness adjustment circuit of Embodiment 1, so that video signals that are brightness adjusted and cutoff adjusted can be obtained without clamp circuits being provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As in Embodiment 1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), the video data signal and the brightness and cutoff adjustment data signal are synthesized by the digital signal synthesis section <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in the step where the signals are digital, and then the synthesized signal can be D/A converted by the D/A converter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> An example of a brightness adjustment circuit for brightness adjusting a video signal in response to a video signal that has been brightness adjusted in the manner, for example, as described in Embodiment 1 will be described. In this example, an internal video signal generated inside a device in which a brightness adjustment circuit is provided and an external video signal that is externally input are selectively switched. Such switching is used, for example, to display a receiving channel number or character information by partial superimposition on broadcast video images, or to switch between broadcast video images and other video images by unit of one or more frame periods for display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in this brightness adjustment circuit, a brightness adjusted video signal output from the analog signal synthesis circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> or the D/A converter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of Embodiment 1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) is input as the internal video signal to one input terminal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a switch <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (switching means), and also is input to a sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (holding means). The sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> holds a voltage of the pedestal level of the internal video signal, that is, the level corresponding to the brightness adjustment signal output from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at a timing in accordance with a sampling pulse in synchronization with the internal video signal. A clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> (clamping means) clamps the pedestal level of the external video signal in response to a clamp pulse, using the voltage held by the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> as the reference voltage, and inputs it to an input terminal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the switch <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. An output terminal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the switch <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is connected to the amplifier <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, and the amplifier <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are configured, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in greater detail. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes a first emitter follower circuit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, a differential switch <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, a sample/hold switch <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, a sample/hold current source <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, a first current mirror circuit <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, a capacitor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, a second emitter follower circuit <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, and a third emitter follower <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The first emitter follower circuit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> includes a transistor <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> whose base receives an internal video signal and a power source <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The differential switch <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> includes transistors <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> whose bases receive an output voltage (emitter voltage) from the first emitter follower circuit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> and a feedback voltage, which will be described later, respectively, and the differential switch <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> compares the two voltages. The sample/hold switch <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> lets the differential switch <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to be on at a timing when a sampling pulse of H level is input. The sample/hold current source <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is connected between the sample/hold switch <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> and GND (ground). The first current mirror circuit <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> includes transistors <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and performs mirroring with respect to collector currents of the two transistors. The capacitor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is connected to the ground at one terminal and holds a pedestal level (voltage) of the internal video signal set by charge and discharge by the collector currents of the transistors <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in accordance with the difference in the base voltages of the transistors <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> while the sampling pulse is in L (Low) level. The second emitter follower circuit <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> includes a transistor <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> whose base receives a voltage held by the capacitor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and a power source <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The third emitter follower <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> includes a transistor <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> whose base receives an output from the second emitter follower <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and a power source <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> and feedbacks the output to a transistor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of the differential switch <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> has a similar configuration to that of the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> includes a fourth emitter follower circuit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> including a transistor <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and a power source <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, a differential switch <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> including transistors <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, a clamp switch <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, a clamp power source <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, a second current mirror circuit <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> including transistors <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, a capacitor <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, a fifth emitter follower circuit <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> including a transistor <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and a power source <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, and a sixth emitter follower <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> including a transistor <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and a power source <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>. However, the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is different from the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in the following points: An output from the second emitter follower circuit <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> of the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is input to the base of the transistor <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>; the clamp switch <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> is configured so as to be on/off in response to a clamp pulse in synchronization with an external video signal; and an external video signal is input to one terminal of the capacitor <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Thus, the pedestal level of the external video signal is clamped so as to be equal to the pedestal level of the internal video signal held in the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> An amplifier <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> includes a differential amplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, a voltage source <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, current sources <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>, a third current mirror circuit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, and a load resistor <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. The differential amplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> includes transistors <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, and a resistor <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>, and converts a voltage signal that is a video signal selected by the switch <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to a current signal. The voltage source <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> generates a voltage that is used as the reference for the conversion from a voltage to a current. The current sources <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> supply current to the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. The third current mirror circuit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> includes transistors <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> and performs mirroring with respect to the collector currents of the two transistors. The load resistor <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> converts the collector current of the transistor <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> to a voltage. Thus, an amplified output video signal is output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the thus configured brightness adjustment circuit, an internal video signal that is brightness adjusted in the manner, for example, as described in Embodiment 1 and a sampling pulse are input to the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The sampling pulse is similar to a general clamp pulse, and is a signal that turns into high at a timing of a back porch during a horizontal blanking in an internal video signal. The internal video signal level when the sampling pulse is in H (High) level, that is, the pedestal level is held by the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and signals of the same level are output while the sampling pulse is in L level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The voltage that is held by the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and output is input to the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> as the reference voltage. Thus, an external video signal input to the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is clamped so that the pedestal level thereof is equal to that of the internal video signal at a timing when a clamp pulse becomes high. In other words, when the pedestal level of the internal video signal is changed by brightness adjustment, the pedestal level of the external video signal is also changed in response to that change. Therefore, the basic luminance of video images to be displayed is always the same, regardless of the switching of the switch. <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to the external video signal or the internal video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> If the internal video signal and the external video signal are video signals in synchronization with each other, the sampling pulse and the clamp pulse are the same signal, so that either one of them can be input to the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Even if the internal video signal and the external video signal are not in synchronization with each other, either the sampling pulse or the clamp pulse that is in synchronization with either video signal of the internal video signal or the external video signal that is to be displayed (the sampling pulse in the case of the internal video signal, and the clamp pulse in the case of the external video) is input commonly to the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> in the following case: A switch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is provided at the output of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>; or the output current from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is zero when the external video signal is selected by the switch <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. In other words, in the case where the external video signal is selected by the switch <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and only a voltage of a (constant) level in accordance with the brightness adjusted signal output from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is input to the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, then a voltage that is constantly in the same level is held even if sampling is performed in any timings. Therefore, sampling by the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and clamping by the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> can be performed simultaneously at a clamp pulse that is in synchronization with the external video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible to clamp the external video signal over a plurality of horizontal scanning periods or frame periods after sampling of the pedestal level of the internal video signal or the level in accordance with the brightness adjusted signal is performed, for example, in a first horizontal scanning period without performing sampling for every horizontal scanning period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is not necessarily provided, and for example, as shown in broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, outputs from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or the analog signal synthesis circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> or the like can be input directly to the clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> as the reference voltage. In this case, the circuit scale can be reduced further by omitting the sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the above example, an internal video signal and an external video signal are used as examples of brightness adjusted video signals and other video signals that are not brightness adjusted. However, the video signals are not limited thereto. Moreover, these video signals can be plural. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 4 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> An example of a brightness and cutoff adjustment circuit for brightness adjusting and cutoff adjusting three channel video signals of R, G and B in the same manner as in Embodiment 2 and for brightness adjusting an external video signal in response to an internal video signal that is brightness adjusted in the same manner as in Embodiment 3 will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, this brightness and cutoff adjustment circuit includes the switches <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the sample/hold circuits <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the clamp circuits <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, and the amplifiers <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that are the same as those in Embodiment 3 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Each of them is provided corresponding to each color of R, G, and B. An internal video signal of R, G, and B that is brightness adjusted and cutoff adjusted in the manner, for example, as described in Embodiment 2 is input to each sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. An external video signal of R, G or B is input to each clamp circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Also in this brightness and cutoff adjustment circuit, each section operates with respect to video signals of R, G, and B in the same manner as described in Embodiment 3, so that the pedestal level of the external video signal is set in response to the brightness adjustment and the cutoff adjustment of the internal video signal. As a result, the referential luminance is constantly the same between the internal video signal and the external video signal and suitable white balance can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> When the pedestal levels of the internal video signals for R, G and B are equal to one another, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, only one sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may be provided to which one of the R, the G, and the B internal video signals is input, and the voltage held by that sample/hold circuit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may be input as the reference voltage to the clamp circuits <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. In other words, with one video signal typifying the pedestal level, the pedestal level of other video signals can be adjusted with the typical video signal, so that the circuit scale can be suppressed to be small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention as described above, the pedestal levels are adjusted in the step where the video data is digital or the step where the video data is D/A converted, and there is no need to provide the clamp circuit. Therefore, the circuit scale can be reduced easily. Furthermore, an external video signal or the like can be clamped based on the pedestal level of a video signal whose brightness or the like has been adjusted without using a brightness adjustment signal or the like. Thus, the number of pins or lines of the IC chip can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The invention may be embodied in other forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The embodiments disclosed in this application are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not limiting. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
