<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A rectangular blade-type cutting tool having two edge-on cutting inserts mounted at one end of the blade in a staggered formation with their cutting edges partially overlapping. This type of cutting blade finds particular application in disc-type cutting tool assemblies used for cutting pipes. In such a cutting tool assembly the blade-type cutting tools in accordance with the present invention are equally peripherally distributed on an end face of the cutting tool assembly with the operative cutting edges of each of cutting blade inwardly directed and equally distanced with respect to the axis of rotation of the cutting tool assembly. With such a cutting tool assembly it is only necessary to cut the thickness of a pipe without the necessity of passing across its entire diameter allowing for quick and economical cutting of the pipe. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a cutting tool having two edge-on mounted inserts that is capable of performing cutting operations by means of an overlapping configuration of the cutting inserts. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cutting tools having edge-on mounted inserts are known. Such a tool is shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,529,440 to Schmidt. As shown in &apos;440, a single cutting insert is mounted edge-on on a front end of a blade. When performing parting or slotting operations with such a tool, the width of the slot is limited to the width of the operative cutting edge of the cutting insert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Another tool having edge-on mounted inserts is shown in Japanese Publication Number 06262422 A to Naoaki. As shown in FIG. 6 of &apos;422, the cutting inserts are alternatingly arranged on the periphery of a disc body. The described arrangement enables overlapping of the operative cutting edges of succeeding cutting inserts for obtaining a wider slot than can be obtained by a single cutting insert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such a tool suffers from the disadvantage that if an insert pocket breaks due to a breakage of a cutting insert than it is necessary to replace the entire disc body. Furthermore, in such a tool, the cutting diameter is fixed and depends on the diameter of the disc body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a cutting tool that significantly reduces or overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a cutting tool to part a fixed pipe by cutting around it without being limited by the diameter of the pipe. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Attention is drawn to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As shown, a cutting tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and two cutting inserts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> mounted therein. The blade is made of tool steel and the cutting inserts are made of cemented carbide, for example, tungsten carbide. The blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a rear body portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, having a height H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, is integrally connected to a front insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a height H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A front to rear longitudinal direction A is defined from the insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the body portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. According to a preferred embodiment, the body portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extends rearwardly from the insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction A. The blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a right side <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and a left side <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that extend between an upper side <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a lower side <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The body portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> generally has a prismoidal shape having a right side face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, parallel to a left side face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a top face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, parallel, in a side view of the blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to a bottom face <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A width W of the body portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is substantially smaller that the height H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the body portion. In order to secure the clamping of the blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a machine as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, according to one embodiment, the top face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the bottom face <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are slanted at an acute angle a with respect to the left side face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. According to another embodiment, not shown in the figures, the blade is retained to a blade holder by means of screws passing through through bores that extend between the right side and the left side of the blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a right side face <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> parallel to a left side face <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a bottom portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has a lower surface substantially aligned with the bottom face <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the body portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and, a top portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that protrudes upwardly with respect to the top face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the body portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Hence, the height H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is larger than the height H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the body portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises an upper insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, located in the top portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a lower insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, located in the bottom portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The upper insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is upwardly located with respect to the lower insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and is separated therefrom by a rearwardly extending recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The two insert receiving pockets are similar and therefore only one of them will be described. The upper insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprises a rear wall <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that is transversely directed with respect to the longitudinal direction A and is substantially perpendicular to the right side face <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A lower wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is located adjacent and in front of the rear wall <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, perpendicular thereto, and substantially perpendicular to the right side face <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that cutting inserts having other geometries can be used. If, for example, a triangular cutting insert is used, then clearly the lower wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will not be perpendicular to the rear wall <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, but will make an appropriate angle therewith. A side wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is located adjacent the rear wall <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the lower wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and is substantially perpendicular to each one of them. The side wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of each of the insert receiving pockets is slanted at an acute angle &dgr; with respect to the adjacent side face of the insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Typically, the angle &dgr; is 2&deg;. A threaded bore <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extends, substantially perpendicularly, from the side wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the right side face <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. It is understood that the threaded bore <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the lower insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> extends, substantially perpendicularly, from the side wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the lower insert receiving pocket to the left side face <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it can be said that each of the insert receiving pockets is directed towards a different side face of the insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, namely, the upper insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is directed towards the left side of the blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the lower insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is directed towards the right side of the blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A distance D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the side wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the upper insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the right side face <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is smaller than a distance D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the side wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the upper insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the plane of the left side face <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a distance D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the side wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the lower insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the left side face <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is smaller than a distance D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the side wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the lower insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the plane of the right side face <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Planes P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> pass through the lower wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of each of the insert receiving pockets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, respectively. The planes P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> define therebetween an internal acute angle &bgr; having an apex Q. The internal acute angle &bgr; is typically in the range of 0&deg; to 50&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the two cutting inserts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are identical and therefore only one of them will be described. The cutting insert has a generally prismoidal shape, having a top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a bottom surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and a side surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> connecting between the top and bottom surfaces. The side surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has two parallel upper and lower walls <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and two parallel front and rear walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> that are perpendicular to the upper and lower walls <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. A through bore <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, having an axis B, extends between the top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, substantially perpendicular to them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The cutting insert has a vertical symmetry plane P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that contains the axis B and is parallel to the front and rear walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and a horizontal symmetry plane P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that contains the axis B and is parallel to the upper and lower walls <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The juncture between each of the upper and lower walls <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and each of the front and rear walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> defines a cutting edge <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Each cutting edge <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> being slanted at an acute angle &ggr; with respect to the symmetry plane P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and having a rake surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> at the adjacent upper and lower side walls <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. An indented relief surface <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> is provided on the bottom surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> adjacent each of the rake surfaces <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Each of the cutting inserts is retained to its pocket by a clamping screw <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that passes through the through bore <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and threadingly engages the threaded bore <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the insert receiving pocket. As already mentioned, each of the insert receiving pockets is directed towards a different side face of the insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, therefore, also the clamped cutting inserts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> face different sides of the cutting tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the operative cutting edges <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the cutting inserts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are oppositely slanted. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in a front view of the cutting tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the two operative cutting edges <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> overlap between planes P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that pass through respective inner extremities <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the cutting edges and are parallel to the side faces <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> serves as a chip gullet for the operative cutting edge of the cutting insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is retained in the lower insert receiving pocket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In general, the two cutting inserts are directed so that they present the same orientation with respect to a workpiece that is machined by the cutting tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. That is, each of the cutting inserts has the same rake and relief angles with respect to the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The cutting insert described above has four cutting edges, that is, two pairs of diametrically opposed identical cutting edges <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The indexing of such a cutting insert takes place as follows: when a cutting edge is worn and it is necessary to place a new cutting edge instead, the cutting insert is taken out of its insert receiving pocket and rotated 180&deg; around the axis B to present the diametrically opposed cutting edge as the new operative cutting edge. The use of the two other cutting edges takes place in the other insert receiving pocket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of a cutting insert according to the present invention, the cutting insert is square and has four identical cutting edges having a 90&deg; rotational symmetry between them. In such a case, the cutting insert does not have vertical or horizontal symmetry planes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of a cutting insert according to the present invention, the cutting insert shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is mirror-duplicated with respect to the bottom surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In which case, and depending on the overlapping required between the cutting edges of adjacent cutting inserts, the cutting insert has eight effective cutting edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of a cutting insert according to the present invention, the cutting insert is a triangle having 120&deg; rotational symmetry between its three or six cutting edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is an end view of a preferred embodiment of a cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, having an axis of rotation O and using a plurality of cutting tools <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> clamped on a disc <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The cutting tools <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are equally peripherally distributed on an end face <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> such that the insert retaining portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of each of the cutting tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inwardly directed with respect to the axis of rotation O. Each of the operative cutting edges <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is equally distanced from the axis of rotation O. Each blade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is retained to the disc <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> by a clamping mechanism that is not described in detail since it is not an essential feature of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is used for cutting a pipe <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> having a wall thickness T. The pipe <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is shown as an ellipse since, in this case, the cutting plane of the cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is not perpendicular to the axis of the pipe. In order to perform the cutting, the pipe <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> stands still in place while the cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> rotates around it in the direction F. The movement of the cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is a combination of two separate movements; the first, being a rotational movement around the axis O, the second, being a translation movement on an inwardly converging spiral around the elliptical contour of the pipe <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> By means of the construction and operation of the cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> there is obtained a quick and economical cutting of the pipe <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> since it is only necessary to cut the thickness T of the pipe <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> without the necessity of passing across its entire diameter. The width of cut W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), in each cutting tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is obtained by the combined width of the operative cutting edges of the two cutting inserts. If small amendments in the width of cut are required, within about 1 mm, it is possible to change the dimensions D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for changing the amount of overlapping between the two cutting inserts, without changing the size of the cutting inserts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the case described above, when cutting a pipe <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> obliquely to its axis, cutting inserts of the cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, that face the same direction, are subjected to axial forces when they first come in contact with the pipe since the cutting inserts that face the other direction have not yet made contact with the pipe. Since the cutting inserts are mounted edge-on in the insert receiving pockets, the axially mounted clamping screw <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> assists in resisting those axial forces that tend to remove the cutting inserts out of their pockets. This is an advantage of the present cutting tool assembly with respect to cutting tool assemblies known in the art that use cutting inserts wedged in recesses along the periphery of a saw blade and held in the recesses by means of elastic forces exerted by the blade. Such a prior art saw blade, as shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,524,518 to Sundstr&ouml;m, have less resistance against axial cutting forces relative to the cutting tool assembly of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described to a certain degree of particularity, it should be understood that various alterations and modifications could be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed. </paragraph>
