<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-198552, filed Jun. 29, 2001, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and particularly to a vertical type power MOSFET having a trenched gate structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A trench is formed in a semiconductor substrate, and this trench is used to form a trenched gate structure. These trenched gate structures are used in semiconductor devices such as an IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) and a MOSFET (MOS-type Field Effect Transistor), and this is particularly advantageous for electrical power applications. For example, because a power MOSFET having a trenched gate structure can attain high switching speeds, high current capacities and a breakdown voltage of about several tens volts to 100 volts, they are widely used for switching a power source in portable devices or personal computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An n channel type power MOSFET having a trenched gate structure will be described in the following as an example of such a power MOSFET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> does not represent a prior art. It is a schematic sectional view of the main portions of an n-channel type trench gate structure power MOSFET which was experimentally designed by the present inventors in the process of achieving the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> That is to say, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> illustrates, as an example of a power MOSFET, a cross sectional of one half (half pitch) of a paired vertical type MOSFETS in the plurality of units serially formed on a semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The schematic structure is such that an n&minus; type drift layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and a p type base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are formed as a laminated body in sequence on the semiconductor substrate used as a drain layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a trench T is formed on the laminated body. A gate electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the inner wall of the trench T with a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The drain electrode <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is formed at the bottom surface side of the n&plus; type drain layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> which is the semiconductor substrate. An n&plus;type source region <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which is adjacent to the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the p&plus; type region <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> which is formed adjacent thereto are provided on the p&plus; type base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a source electrode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is formed so as to extend across these regions <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In this type of power MOSFET, when a predetermined voltage is applied to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an inverse layer is formed on the region adjacent to the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the power MOSFET turns on and current flows between the source electrode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the drain electrode <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, in the type of power MOSFET shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, there is a problem that even if the devices are made small, the turn-on resistance or on resistance thereof cannot be effectively reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> That is to say, in the case of the type of power MOSFET shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the resistance of the device in the on state, that is the on resistance, is determined mainly by the channel resistance component and the drift resistance component. The channel resistance component is the resistance component of the channel region formed on the inverse layer of the p&minus; type base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in the on state. On the other hand, the drift resistance component is the resistance component which appears for the on current in the n&minus; type drift layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce the on resistance of the device, the pitch P of the device unit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> was reduced to thereby increase device density on the semiconductor substrate. That is, the channel density was increased and thus the on resistance of the device was decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Due to the quick advances in semiconductor size reduction processing technology in recent years, the channel density is being rapidly increased, and the channel resistance component is being greatly reduced. Specifically, size reduction has advanced to the extent that the device pitch P is below 0.5 &mgr;m. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows the half pitch structure which is one half the paired device unit. However, in the actual device in which the structure shown in the figure is juxtaposed in both sides thereof, the width of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which is sandwiched between the two adjacent trenched gate structures has been made so small that it is substantially equal to the pitch P, and is less than 0.5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further, under these conditions, the on resistance of the recent power MOSFET is such that the above-mentioned drift resistance component has come to account for approximately two-thirds of the total resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> That is to say, even when the manufacturing process is further improved and the device pitch P becomes even smaller, there is the problem that significant reduction in the on resistance of the device can not be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case of a power MOSFET of the type having a breakdown voltage of 30 volts, it is extremely difficult to reduce the on resistance to 20 m&OHgr;mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to reduce the thickness t of the drift layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, thereby reducing the drift resistance component. In order to do this, a method can be considered in which the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is made thicker and when voltage is applied between the gate electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (the source electrode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) and the drain electrode <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is caused to receive a portion of the applied voltage and thus the thickness of the drift layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a schematic view showing the cross-section structure of the power MOSFET formed based on this concept. The device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> except that the thickness of the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is greater than that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Thus the components are indicated by the same reference numerals. That is to say, in the power MOSFET shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, by making the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> thicker, the portion by which the thickness is increased receives a portion of the applied voltage, and thus the thickness t of the drift layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> However, when the thickness of the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is increased in this manner, the threshold voltage of the power MOSFET is increased. As a result, the on resistance is increased by the amount by which the channel resistance is increased when the same gate voltage is applied, and a problem is caused that on resistance of the device can not be effectively reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the power MOSFET having this structure, because the on resistance is determined by the drift resistance component, there is the problem that even if the device is made smaller, the on resistance thereof can not be efficiently reduced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a power MOSFET having the n channel trenched gate structure according to the first embodiment of the present invention for showing a structure of one of the plurality of device units formed on the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The schematic structure thereof is such that the n&minus; type drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the p type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are disposed on the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is the n&plus; type semiconductor substrate. Further, a pair of n&plus; type source layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed on the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such that the p&plus; layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed therebetween. Trenches Ta and Tb respectively, are formed along the side surfaces of the source layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and upper portion of drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The lowermost end of the trenches Ta and Tb terminate at an inner portion of the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Gate electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed so that the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are formed respectively on the surface of the inner walls of the trenches Ta and Tb are interposed therebetween to form trenched gate structures. The trenched gate structures each is formed so as to pass through the p type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the n type drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, from the side of the source regions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the device (which are described hereinafter), and reaches the n&plus; type drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The n&plus; type source regions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are adjacent to the trenched gate structures and the p&plus; type region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is formed adjacent thereto are provided on the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the source electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed so as to extend across these regions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the drain electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed on the back surface of the n&plus; type drain region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the power MOSFET shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the thickness of the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>changes such that two steps are formed, and this is a feature of the present embodiment. That is, in the trenched gate structure, the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed to have thin portions facing the source regions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the p type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and thick portions facing the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the n&plus; type drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. By varying the thickness of the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>such that it is thin at the source side, and thick at the drain side, the voltage between the gate G (or the source S) and the drain D can be held by the thick portions of the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, without increasing the threshold value of the device, and thus the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be made thin. Therefore the inner resistance of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> That is to say, in the portions b<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which face the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having channels formed in the inverse layer, the thickness C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Since the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>facing the base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are made thin in this manner, when the same voltage is applied, the threshold value of the power MOFSET is made lower than a case where the gate insulating film is thick. At the same time, the amount of current flowing in the channel increases due to the expanded inversion layer, and the on resistance of the device is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Also, by the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being formed so as to be thick in the portions b<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which extend from the portion which face the upper portion of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the portion which opposes a part of the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, some of the voltage applied between the drain D and the gate G (or the source S) can be held by the thick portions b<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As a result, the thickness t of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be decreased and the drift resistance component can be effectively reduced. Consequently, it becomes possible to decrease the on resistance of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In addition to decreasing the thickness of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in this manner, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the structure is such that the trenched gate structure penetrates the thin drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as well as partially into the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, as in the modification of this embodiment which is described hereinafter, the trenched gate structure does not need to penetrate through the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and to reach at the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The trenched gate structure may be formed so that the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is not penetrated completely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Further, a second feature of the embodiment of the power MOSFET shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is the impurity concentration gradient of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. That is to say, in the first embodiment of the present invention, the impurity concentration gradient in the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is not fixed to be constant when viewed in the depth direction of the trenches Ta, Tb, but to have a unique distribution. The drift resistance component in the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be further reduced effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a graph showing an impurity concentration gradient in the depth direction of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the power MOSFET of an embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the concentration of n type impurities in the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> increases sequentially or linearly when viewed in the depth direction of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or trenches Ta, Tb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is desirable that the impurity concentration at the upper end A of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is the portion adjacent to the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is set at 5.5E&plus;16 or 5.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Further, according to the experiments of the inventors, it is known that the impurity concentration should be in the range between 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>16 </superscript></highlight>and 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. If the impurity concentration exceeds this value, the breakdown voltage of the device is insufficient. Conversely, if the impurity concentration at the upper end A is less than this value, the on resistance can not be sufficiently reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Further, if the balance between the breakdown voltage and the on resistance of the device is taken into consideration, for better practical applications, the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at the upper end A, is preferably within a range of 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>16 </superscript></highlight>to 7&times;10<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and more preferably a range of 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>16 </superscript></highlight>to 6&times;10<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, the case in which the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at lower end B, that is, the impurity concentration of the portion adjacent to the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is changed in the same manner as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, will be described in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a graph showing the dependency of the breakdown voltage V and the on resistance Ron of the power MOSFET shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> on the impurity concentration at the lower end B of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the abscissa in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the impurity concentration at the lower end B of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the left side ordinate shows the breakdown voltage of the power MOSFET, while the right side ordinate shows the on resistance Ron. It is to be noted that here the impurity concentration at the upper end A is fixed at 5.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Further, the parameters of the device structure used here are as follows. The half pitch P of the device unit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>&equals;0.4 &mgr;m; the thickness t of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&equals;1.2 &mgr;m; the thickness of thin portion b<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the gate insulating film&equals;0.5 &mgr;m; the thickness of the thick portion b<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the gate insulating film&equals;1.5 &mgr;m; the thickness c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the thin gate insulating film&equals;0.015 &mgr;m; and the thickness c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the thick gate insulating film&equals;0.15 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the on resistance Ron of the device decreases as the impurity concentration at the lower end B is increased, while the breakdown voltage V has a maximum value for a specific impurity concentration. For example, for an impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of approximately 2.1E&plus;17, that is, 2.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, the breakdown voltage reaches its peak value of approximately 36.3 volts, and the on resistance at this time is approximately 1.73 m&OHgr;mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Further, if the impurity concentration at the lower end of drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is approximately 2.3&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, the breakdown voltage of the device is 36 volts, and the on resistance Ron is approximately 1.7 m&OHgr;mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The on resistance of this embodiment is decreased by approximately {fraction (1/10)} when compared with that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>, for example, in which the impurity concentration of the drift layer was fixed constant in the depth direction of the trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> More generally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is preferable that the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the portion B adjacent to the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in the range of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Further, if the balance between the breakdown voltage and the on resistance of the device is taken into consideration, the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at the portion B adjacent to the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is preferably within a range of 1.7&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 2.4&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Further, at the portion B adjacent to the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the impurity concentration is even more preferably within the range of 1.8&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 2.3&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>since a breakdown voltage exceeding 36 volts can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, by causing the distribution of the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, such that it increase sequentially when viewed in the depth direction of the trenches Ta and Tb, it becomes possible for the breakdown voltage to be maintained while the on resistance of the device is decreased remarkably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is varied such that the distribution is substantially linear. However, this embodiment is not limited thereto, and the impurity concentration may be changed so as to be curved or to form steps. That is to say, other distributions fall within the scope of the present embodiment provided that the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is substantially sequentially increased when viewed from the depth direction of the trenches Ta and Tb, and the same effects of the embodiment are obtained. For example, as described later, a plurality of layers each having different impurity concentration may be laminated to form the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Further, by making a further adjustment to the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the inventors conceived of a way to further maintain the breakdown voltage while further lowering the on resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graph showing another example of the impurity concentration distribution of drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the embodiment. That is, the ordinate in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the distance in the depth direction of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the abscissa shows the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the example of the impurity concentration distribution shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the impurity concentration distribution is substantially V-shaped when viewed in the depth direction of the trenches Ta and Tb. In other words, it can be said that this is a impurity concentration distribution in which a highly doped impurity concentration region having a peak value Pi has been added to the upper side, that is the portion A that contacts the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in a impurity concentration distribution such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The inventors carried out quantitative assessments of the devices having an impurity concentration distribution such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a graph showing the dependency of the breakdown voltage V and the on resistance Ron of the power MOSFET, on the impurity concentration at the lower end B of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the case of the impurity concentration distribution of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the abscissa of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the impurity concentration at the lower end B of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, while the left side ordinate shows the breakdown voltage V of the power MOSFET, and the right side ordinate shows the on resistance Ron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the parameters of this device structure are the same as those listed above for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the impurity concentration of the peak value Pi at the upper end A of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is fixed at 1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> that the on resistance Ron of the device decreases as the impurity concentration at the lower end B is increased, while the breakdown voltage V has a maximum value with respect to a specific impurity concentration. This tendency is the same as the device exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. However, when compared with that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is seen that the breakdown voltage is maintained at substantially the same level and the on-resistance Ron is significantly decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> For example, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the impurity concentration of the lower end B of drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is approximately 1.9&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to 2.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, and the breakdown voltage of the device reaches the peak value of approximately 36.3 volts. In addition the on resistance Ron at this time is approximately 1.68 volts when the impurity concentration is 1.9&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and it decreases to approximately 1.66 volts when the impurity is 2.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. That is to say, when compared with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the breakdown voltage is substantially the same while the on resistance decreased by approximately 10 percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> once again, a more general case will be described. It is preferable that the impurity concentration of the upper end A of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, that is the portion adjacent to the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the range of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. If the impurity concentration at the upper end A exceeds this value, the breakdown voltage of the device is insufficient. Conversely, if the impurity concentration at the upper end A is less than this value, the on resistance can not be sufficiently reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Further, if the balance between the breakdown voltage and the on resistance of the device is taken into consideration, for better practical application, the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at the upper end A, is preferably within a range of 1.4&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, at the portion Pm in which the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has the minimum value, the value is preferably in the range of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>16 </superscript></highlight>to 9&times;10<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Further, it is preferable that the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the portion B adjacent to the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in the range of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Also, if the balance between the breakdown voltage and the on resistance of the device is taken into consideration, the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at the portion B adjacent to the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is preferably within a range of 1.4&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 2.6&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Further, if the impurity concentration at this portion B is made to be within the range of 1.7&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>to 2.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, a remarkable effect is achieved since a breakdown voltage exceeding 36 volts can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> differ by two digits and thus the concentration of the electric field at the interface between the two layers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> raises a problem. In the present embodiment, by causing the film thickness b<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>facing the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to be thick, the critical electric field can be raised. Further, by providing the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with this type of impurity concentration gradient, the concentration of the electric field in only the border portion of the layers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be controlled. The concentration region of the electric field is made to expend from the lower portion B of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is close to the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the middle portion thereof and the degree of the field concentration can be decreased. As a result the breakdown voltage increases and the doping level of the impurity in the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be raised, and thus the on resistance can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a schematic view showing an example of the electric field distribution at the interface between the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the one half device made in the right side trench Ta of the full-pitch device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this case, 20 volts are applied to the device of the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an enlarged view of a corresponding portion of the electric field distribution of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the electric field distribution when the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is set as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference> show in a case where the impurity concentration distributions in the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> adjacent to the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have similar profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the case of the device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in order for the on resistance to be almost at the same level as that of the device in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the concentration of the n-type impurities in the entire drift layer was made 1.45&times;10<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. The result of this assessment using the field distributions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the breakdown voltage when the impurity concentration of the drift layer is fixed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) was approximately 34 volts, while the breakdown voltage could be increased to approximately 36.3 volts in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> which has a substantially V-shaped impurity concentration distribution based on this embodiment. That is, when compared to the case in which the impurity concentration of the drift layer is fixed constant, in this embodiment, when the on resistance of the device is at the same level, the breakdown voltage can be made higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the reason the properties are improved in the device in which the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provides the V-shaped impurity concentration distribution exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will be described in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Firstly, by imparting from the portion A to the portion B of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with a concentration gradient which increases linearly up to the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as described above, the concentration of the electric field between the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is lessened and a reduction of the on-resistance is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the channel formed in the inversion layer is turned on, the highly doped impurity concentration region on the upper side A of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can receive much current flow in the base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> side. Thus, lessening of the electric field and a reduction in the on resistance can be simultaneously realized. This is because the region of the concentration of electric field on the lower side B is isolated, and even if the impurity concentration at the upper side A is increased, no effect is applied to the side A and relaxing of the electric field can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> When the electric field distributions at the time of 20-volt application shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> are viewed, it is seen that when the impurity concentration of the drift layer is fixed (in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), the breakdown voltage remains at the level of 34.0 V, while when the impurity concentration gradient has a substantial V-shape (in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), the breakdown voltage increases to 36.4 V. Despite the fact that breakdown voltage is high (the voltage applied to the device is high), the concentration of the electric fields at the crossing point among the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be controlled in the similar manner as in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In this manner, by causing the concentration distribution in the depth direction of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the trenches Ta and Tb to have the substantially V-shaped configuration in the embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the on resistance of the device can be effectively decreased without decreasing the breakdown voltage. This means that the drift resistance component which is one of the resistance components when the device is in the on state, that is the resistance component of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is effectively reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As a result, that portion of the on resistance of the device which is the channel resistance component is increased. Accordingly, the channel density can be increased by reducing the device pitch, (the width p in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). If the channel resistance component is decreased, it becomes possible to further decrease the on resistance. That is, as a result, a decrease in the on resistance can be achieved as the device unit is made small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The effect of this embodiment is particularly remarkable in an actual device having the device exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with a full-pitch structure, which is so small that the width P of the p-type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> sandwiched between the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed in the adjacent trenched gate structures is less than 0.5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> That is to say, according to this embodiment, when the device is made small in this manner and the percentage of the on resistance which is accounted for by the drift resistance component becomes significant, the drift resistance component is effectively decreased. As a result, it becomes possible for the on resistance of the device to be greatly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the impurity concentration profile in the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is varied such that the distribution is a substantially and smoothly continuous curve. However this invention is not limited thereto, and the impurity concentration may be changed such that the distribution is linear or step-shape. That is to say, other distributions may fall within the scope of the present embodiment provided that the impurity concentration of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a substantially V-shaped distribution having a minimum value when viewed in the depth direction of the trenches Ta and Tb. Accordingly, in forming the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a plurality of layers having different concentrations of the impurity may be sequentially formed, for example. A manufacturing process of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Now, the manufacturing process for the power MOSFET of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows a semiconductor substrate used as the n&plus; type drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, an n&minus; type epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A is grown on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by epitaxial growth. Subsequently, an n&minus;&minus; type epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B of a high resistivity is grown epitaxially on the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A. The total thickness of these two epitaxial layers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B is set so as to have the same thickness as the n&minus; drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this state, the impurity concentration profile of the epitaxial layers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B and of the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is as shown at the right side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. It can be seen that the impurity concentration lessens in a step-shape configuration upward from the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In this state the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> proceeds to a thermal treatment step in which heat is applied to bring the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a predetermined temperature. As a result, thermal diffusion occurs and the differences in the impurity concentration between the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A, as well as that between the epitaxial layers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B are made uniform. As shown at the right side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> substantially linearly increasing impurity concentration distribution profile is formed between portions A and B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to form a profile having the peak Pi of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>D, an n type impurity is implanted from a surface of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at a predetermined acceleration energy. As a result, n-type impurities are doped with a predetermined concentration at the portion close to the surface of the n-drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When heat treatment is carried out in this state, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>E, an impurity concentration profile corresponding to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> which has a smooth concentration peak Pi is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the above description made by referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>E, a two-layer structure with two epitaxial layers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B was described. However, three or more epitaxial layers may be grown thus forming a profile having an even smoother linear curve. In addition, it is not necessary for the formation of the impurity profile by heat treatment to be carried out before a process for forming the device formation of the power MOSFET begins, and this can be carried out using heat treatment such as the diffusion step for the p type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The following describes some embodiments and modifications of power MOSFETS according to the present invention. In the following, the explanations will be given not by referring to the full-pitch structure such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> but by referring to a half-pitch structure formed with respect to the right side trench Ta shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Further, the portions shown in the following figures corresponding to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are designated by the same or similar reference numerals and the explanations thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the main portions of a modification of a power MOSFET of the first embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this modification of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the trenched gate structure includes a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which has an end terminated in the n type drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In other words, the film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not extended into the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The remaining structure is the same as that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In this modification too, the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has an impurity concentration distribution like that exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Further, in this modification, the trenched gate structure does not penetrate the n type drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, but terminates at level above the bottom of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In applications in which the breakdown voltage takes priority over the on resistance of the device, this type of structure is sometimes favorable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a cross-section of the main portions of a second modification of the MOSFET of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the same numbers have been assigned to the portions which are the same as those in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and thus detailed explanations thereof have been omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In this second modification too, the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has an impurity concentration distribution like that exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Further, in this modification, the film thickness of the portion b<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a distribution such that it is sequentially increased in the depth direction of the trench Ta. Even when the thickness has such a distribution, in the portion adjacent to the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a portion of the voltage which is applied between the gate G (or the source S) and the drain D is held by the thick gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>without increasing the threshold value of the device. Thus the thickness t of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be decreased and the drift resistance component can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that in the modification shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the trenched gate structure penetrates the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, but as exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the trenched gate structure may be ended at a portion above the bottom of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view showing the main portions of a further modification of the power MOSFET of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> also, the same numbers have been assigned to the parts which are the same as those in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and thus detailed explanations thereof have been omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In this modification too, the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a impurity concentration distribution such as that exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Further, in this modification, the thickness of the portion b<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a distribution such that it increases step-wise in the depth direction of the trench Ta. Even when the thickness has such a distribution, in the portion adjacent to the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a portion of the voltage which is applied between the gate G (or the source S) and the drain D is held by the thick gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>without increasing the threshold value of the device. Thus the thickness t of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be decreased and the drift resistance component can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the trenched gate structure terminates at a level above the bottom of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, but as exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the trenched gate structure may also penetrate the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The embodiments and modifications shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> each has the p type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided between the n type source region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and n type drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to form an inversion layer in the base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by applying a gate voltage to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) in the on state of the device, thereby flowing on current in the channel formed in the inversion layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to this type of embodiments and modifications. It is applicable to a power MOSFET having a structure including a high resistivity base layer of the same conductivity type as those of the source region and the drift layer. When the device is turned on, a storage layer of a majority carrier is formed in the base layer by applying a gate voltage to the gate electrode. The storage layer is used as a channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view of an embodiment having the base layer forming the storage layer. In this embodiment, only the p type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is changed to n&minus;&minus; type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the remaining portions are the same as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, so that the detailed explanations are omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, when the device is turned on, in a portion of the n&minus;&minus; type base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> adjacent to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) a storage layer of electrons is formed by the gate voltage applied to the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The on current of the device passes through this storage layer from the source region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) to the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When no on voltage is applied to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), or when the device is in off state, the base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is depleted to cut off the current in the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In this case too, since the portion b<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) facing the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is made thick in the similar manner as in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> part of the voltage applied across the source/drain electrodes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be held by the thick portion, thereby realizing a high breakdown voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Further, since the impurity concentration distribution of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be set as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is possible to decrease the on resistance of the device and the electric field concentration at the boundary of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The storage layer formed in the base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> makes the channel region be thick and deep in the base layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby enlarging the sectional area of the channel region. Further, it is possible to increase the impurity concentration at the surface of the channel region. Therefore, a channel resistance can be reduced and the on resistance of the device can also be decreased further. </paragraph>

Even when the thickness has such a distribution, in the portion adjacent to the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a portion of the voltage which is applied between the gate G (or the source S) and the drain D is held by the thick gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>without increasing the threshold value of the device. Thus the thickness t of the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be decreased and the drift resistance component can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In the modification shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the trenched gate structure formed of the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>terminates at the intermediate portion of the n type drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Further, it is possible to form a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> having the end of the trenched gate structure penetrates the drift layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to reach at an intermediate portion of the drain layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The embodiments and modifications of the present invention have been described above with reference to concrete examples. However, the invention is not to be limited thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> For example, the dimensions, configurations, semiconductor types, impurity concentrations, amounts and the like in each of the example may be suitably selected by one skilled in the art. To the extent that such embodiments or modifications achieve the same effect of the present invention, they are intended to be included within the scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> As described in detail above, in the embodiments of the present invention, the channel portion of the gate insulating film is made thin, and the portion of the gate insulating film adjacent to the drift layer is made thick. As a result, the gate insulating film can be made to hold a part of the applied voltage and the thickness of the drift layer can be decreased without increasing the threshold value of the device. As a result, the drift resistance component is decreased and the on resistance of the device is effectively decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Further, by causing the impurity concentration of the drift layer to have a distribution which increases sequentially when viewed in the depth direction of the trench, the breakdown voltage is maintained and the drift resistance component is effectively decreased. That is, it becomes possible to reduce the on resistance of the device while maintaining breakdown voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In summary, the present invention makes it possible to provide a vertical type power MOSFET in which breakdown voltage is maintained while the on resistance is reduced, and this has many merits with respect to manufacturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
