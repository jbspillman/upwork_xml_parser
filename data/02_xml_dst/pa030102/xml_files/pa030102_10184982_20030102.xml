<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a biochemical analysis system. This invention particularly relates to a biochemical analysis system, wherein a structure or characteristics of an organism-originating substance are analyzed by use of a biochemical analysis unit, which comprises a base plate and a plurality of spot-shaped regions located at different positions on or in the base plate, each of multiple kinds of specific binding substances, which are capable of specifically binding to organism-originating substances and whose structures or characteristics are known, having been fixed to one of the spot-shaped regions. This invention also relates to a biochemical analysis unit, a method and a system for managing a biochemical analysis unit, and a method and a system for managing a biochemical analysis medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, as systems for analyzing structures or characteristics of organism-originating substances, micro array analysis systems utilizing micro arrays have been proposed. With the micro array analysis systems, a micro array is prepared by, for example, spotting multiple kinds of specific binding substances, which are capable of specifically binding to organism-originating substances and whose base sequences, base lengths, compositions, and the like, are known, onto different positions on a surface of a carrier, such as a slide glass plate or a membrane filter, by use of a spotting apparatus and thereby forming a plurality of independent spots on the surface of the carrier. Examples of the specific binding substances include hormones, tumor markers, enzymes, antibodies, antigens, abzymes, other proteins, nucleic acids, cDNA&apos;s, DNA&apos;s, and RNA&apos;s. Thereafter, an organism-originating substance, which has been sampled from an organism through extraction, isolation, or the like, or has been subjected to chemical treatment, chemical modification treatment, or the like, and which has been labeled with a fluorescent labeling substance, such as a fluorescent substance or a fluoro chrome, is subjected to hybridization with the specific binding substances, which have been fixed to the spots on the micro array. The organism-originating substance is thus specifically bound to one of the specific binding substances on the micro array. Examples of the organism-originating substances include hormones, tumor markers, enzymes, antibodies, antigens, abzymes, other proteins, nucleic acids, cDNA&apos;s, DNA&apos;s, and mRNA&apos;s. Excitation light is then irradiated to the micro array, and the fluorescence produced by the labeling substance, such as the fluorescent substance or the fluoro chrome, with which the organism-originating substance has been labeled, is photoelectrically detected. In accordance with the results of the photoelectric detection, the organism-originating substance is analyzed. The micro array analysis systems, wherein the spots of the multiple kinds of the specific binding substances are formed at a high density at different positions on the surface of the carrier, such as the slide glass plate or the membrane filter, and wherein the organism-originating substance, which has been labeled with the labeling substance, is subjected to the hybridization with the specific binding substances, has the advantages in that the organism-originating substance is capable of being analyzed quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Besides the micro array analysis systems utilizing the fluorescent substance as the labeling substance, micro array analysis systems utilizing a radioactive labeling substance have also been proposed. With the micro array analysis systems utilizing the radioactive labeling substance, a micro array is prepared by, for example, spotting multiple kinds of specific binding substances, which are capable of specifically binding to organism-originating substances and whose base sequences, base lengths, compositions, and the like, are known, onto different positions on a surface of a carrier, such as a membrane filter, by use of a spotting apparatus and thereby forming a plurality of independent spots on the surface of the carrier. Examples of the specific binding substances include hormones, tumor markers, enzymes, antibodies, antigens, abzymes, other proteins, nucleic acids, cDNA&apos;s, DNA&apos;s, and RNA&apos;s. Thereafter, an organism-originating substance, which has been sampled from an organism through extraction, isolation, or the like, or has been subjected to chemical treatment, chemical modification treatment, or the like, and which has been labeled with a radioactive labeling substance, is subjected to hybridization with the specific binding substances, which have been fixed to the spots on the micro array. The organism-originating substance is thus specifically bound to one of the specific binding substances on the micro array. Examples of the organism-originating substances include hormones, tumor markers, enzymes, antibodies, antigens, abzymes, other proteins, nucleic acids, cDNA&apos;s, DNA&apos;s, and mRNA&apos;s. The micro array is then brought into close contact with a stimulable phosphor sheet comprising a stimulable phosphor layer containing a stimulable phosphor, and the stimulable phosphor layer is thereby exposed to radiation radiated out from the radioactive labeling substance, with which the organism-originating substance has been labeled. Thereafter, the stimulable phosphor layer is exposed to stimulating rays, which cause the stimulable phosphor layer to emit light in proportion to the amount of energy stored on the stimulable phosphor layer during its exposure to the radiation. The light emitted by the stimulable phosphor layer is photoelectrically detected, and an image signal for a biochemical analysis is thereby obtained. In accordance with the thus obtained image signal for a biochemical analysis, the organism-originating substance is analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Further, micro array analysis systems utilizing a labeling substance, which is capable of producing chemiluminescence when being brought into contact with a chemiluminescence substrate, have been proposed. With the proposed micro array analysis systems, a micro array is prepared by forming spot-shaped regions of multiple kinds of specific binding substances at a high density at different positions on a surface of a carrier. Thereafter, an organism-originating substance, which has been labeled with the labeling substance, which is capable of producing the chemiluminescence when being brought into contact with a chemiluminescence substrate, is subjected to specific binding with the specific binding substances at the spot-shaped regions on the micro array. The organism-originating substance is thus specifically bound to one of the specific binding substances on the micro array. The micro array is then brought into contact with the chemiluminescence substrate, and the chemiluminescence having wavelengths falling within the visible light wavelength range is thereby emitted by the labeling substance, with which the organism-originating substance has been labeled. The chemiluminescence is photoelectrically detected, and a digital image signal is thereby obtained. The thus obtained digital image signal is then subjected to image processing, and the image signal having been obtained from the image processing is utilized for reproducing a chemiluminescence image on displaying means, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) display device, or a recording material, such as photographic film. In accordance with the reproduced chemiluminescence image, information concerning the organism-originating substance, such as genetic information, is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Besides the micro array analysis systems utilizing the radioactive labeling substance, the fluorescent labeling substance, or the labeling substance, which is capable of producing the chemiluminescence when being brought into contact with a chemiluminescence substrate, there have also been proposed micro array analysis systems utilizing all of the radioactive labeling substance, the fluorescent labeling substance, and the labeling substance, which is capable of producing the chemiluminescence when being brought into contact with a chemiluminescence substrate. There have further been proposed micro array analysis systems utilizing a combination of two kinds of the labeling substances among the radioactive labeling substance, the fluorescent labeling substance, and the labeling substance, which is capable of producing the chemiluminescence when being brought into contact with a chemiluminescence substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the micro arrays before being subjected to the binding to organism-originating substances vary in kind of each of specific binding substances which form the spots on the micro arrays, spot location pattern, and the like. (The micro array comprising the carrier, such as the support, and a plurality of spots, which are located at different positions on the carrier and to which multiple kinds of specific binding substances have respectively been fixed, will hereinbelow be referred to as the biochemical analysis unit.) Therefore, in order for the structure and the characteristics of the organism-originating substance acting as the object of the analysis to be analyzed, it is necessary to find which biochemical analysis unit was utilized with respect to the organism-originating substance. Accordingly, in the micro array analysis systems described above, the correspondence relationship between the organism-originating substance acting as the object of the analysis and the biochemical analysis unit utilized with respect to the organism-originating substance must be managed. For such purposes, the operator of the analysis has had to memorize which organism-originating substance was taken as the object of the analysis and which biochemical analysis unit was utilized with respect to the organism-originating substance. Also, when an ultimate analysis is to be performed, the operator of the analysis has had to perform processing for specifying the correspondence relationship between the organism-originating substance and the biochemical analysis unit in accordance with the memory of the operator of the analysis, a memorandum made by the operator of the analysis, or the like. Therefore, there is the risk that an error will occur due to a mistake made in memorization or inputting, and correct results of analysis cannot be obtained. In the medical field for making tumor examinations, and the like, incorrect results of analysis lead to fatal results. Therefore, it is important that artificial mistakes be avoided, and the correspondence relationship between the organism-originating substance acting as the object of the examination and the biochemical analysis unit utilized with respect to the organism-originating substance be specified accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, for the same reasons, in the analysis systems utilizing the stimulable phosphor sheets, it is necessary that, besides the correspondence relationship between the organism-originating substance and the biochemical analysis unit utilized with respect to the organism-originating substance, the correspondence relationship between the biochemical analysis unit and the stimulable phosphor sheet utilized with respect to the biochemical analysis unit be specified accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, in some cases, when a biochemical analysis is to be made, a biochemical analysis unit, such as a commercially available biochemical analysis unit, wherein the spots have already been formed with the specific binding substances on the base plate, may be utilized. In other cases, only the base plate, such as the membrane, is purchased, the specific binding substances, which are selected in accordance with the kind of the organism-originating substance, the purpose of the analysis, or the like, are spotted onto the base plate by use of a spotter apparatus, or the like, and the biochemical analysis unit, on which the spots have thus been formed with the specific binding substances, is utilized. In cases where the biochemical analysis unit, on which the spots have been formed, is utilized, it often occurs that the biochemical analysis unit having been utilized one time for the analysis is washed, and only the base plate is reused. In such cases, in order for correct results of analysis to be obtained, it is necessary that the correspondence relationship between the prepared biochemical analysis unit and spot information (i.e., the information representing the kinds of the specific binding substances, the positions, to which the specific binding substances have respectively been spotted, and the like) with respect to the prepared biochemical analysis unit be specified accurately. </paragraph>

Also, the stimulable phosphor sheet is capable of being sorted reliably in accordance with the scrapping period and accommodated in the storage box in accordance with the scrapping period. In this manner, the stimulable phosphor sheet is capable of being stored and managed without fail until the level of the radioactivity of the radioactive labeling substance contained in the stimulable phosphor layer of the stimulable phosphor sheet decreases to the level equal to at most the level that allows the stimulable phosphor sheet to be scrapped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> In such cases, the system for managing a biochemical analysis medium in accordance with the present invention should more preferably be modified such that the data concerning the time acting as the reference time for the calculation of the attenuation period, at which the radiation from the radioactive labeling substance attenuates, contains data concerning a date and hour of execution of the exposure operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Also, in such cases, the system for managing a biochemical analysis medium in accordance with the present invention should more preferably be modified such that the data concerning the time acting as the reference time for the calculation of the attenuation period, at which the radiation from the radioactive labeling substance attenuates, contains data concerning a day of execution of the exposure operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> Further, in such cases, the system for managing a biochemical analysis medium in accordance with the present invention should preferably be modified such that the data concerning the time acting as the reference time for the calculation of the attenuation period, at which the radiation from the radioactive labeling substance attenuates, contains data concerning a date and hour of formation of the radioactive labeling substance. </paragraph>

The stimulable phosphor contained in each of the stimulable phosphor layer regions of the stimulable phosphor sheet may thus be exposed to the radiation radiated out from the radioactive labeling substance contained in the spot-shaped region of the biochemical analysis unit, which spot-shaped region stands facing the stimulable phosphor layer region. In this manner, the electron rays (the beta rays), which have been radiated out from the radioactive labeling substance contained in one of the spot-shaped regions of the biochemical analysis unit, are capable of selectively impinging upon the stimulable phosphor layer region, which stands facing the spot-shaped region of the biochemical analysis unit, and only the corresponding stimulable phosphor layer region is thus capable of being exposed to the electron rays (the beta rays).

<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> With the aforesaid modification of the system for managing a biochemical analysis medium in accordance with the present invention, the support of the stimulable phosphor sheet is provided with the data recording layer, on which data is capable of being recorded, and the exposure apparatus records the management data, the management data containing the data concerning the time acting as the reference time for the calculation of the attenuation period, at which the radiation from the radioactive labeling substance attenuates, and the data concerning the nuclide of the radioactive labeling substance, on the data recording layer of the support of the stimulable phosphor sheet. Therefore, in cases where the data concerning the time acting as the reference time for the calculation of the attenuation period, at which the radiation from the radioactive labeling substance attenuates, and the data concerning the nuclide of the radioactive labeling substance having been used in the exposure operation, the data having been recorded on the support of the stimulable phosphor sheet having been used, are read out from the support of the stimulable phosphor sheet by the biochemical analysis medium sorting apparatus, the scrapping period, at which the level of the radioactivity of the radioactive labeling substance contained in the stimulable phosphor layer of the stimulable phosphor sheet decreases to the level equal to at most the level that allows the stimulable phosphor sheet to be scrapped, is capable of being calculated. Also, the stimulable phosphor sheet is capable of being sorted reliably in accordance with the scrapping period and accommodated in the storage box in accordance with the scrapping period. In this manner, the stimulable phosphor sheet is capable of being stored and managed without fail until the level of the radioactivity of the radioactive labeling substance contained in the stimulable phosphor layer of the stimulable phosphor sheet decreases to the level equal to at most the level that allows the stimulable phosphor sheet to be scrapped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> With the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention, the organism-originating substance, which has been labeled with the at least one labeling substance selected from the group consisting of the radioactive labeling substance, the fluorescent labeling substance, and the labeling substance capable of producing chemiluminescence when being brought into contact with the chemiluminescence substrate, is subjected to the specific binding to the multiple kinds of the specific binding substances, each of which has been fixed to one of the spot-shaped regions of the biochemical analysis unit. Thereafter, the label signal is formed with the label signal forming means, which corresponds to the labeling substance having been used at the time of the specific binding, and the data for a biochemical analysis is formed by reading out the label signal. The thus obtained data for a biochemical analysis is utilized for analyzing the structure, the characteristics, and the like of the organism-originating substance. In such cases, the identification information of the biochemical analysis unit and the identification information of the organism-originating substance are acquired automatically, and the correspondence relationship between the two pieces of the identification information is specified. Therefore, without reliance upon memory of the operator, a memorandum made by the operator, or the like, being made, it is capable of being found accurately which organism-originating substance was subjected to the specific binding with which biochemical analysis unit. Accordingly, artificial mistakes are capable of being avoided, and correct results of analysis are capable of being obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Also, with the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention, the base plate of the biochemical analysis unit may be made from the material having the radiation attenuating properties and/or the light attenuating properties and may have the plurality of the holes, the adsorptive region may be formed in each of the plurality of the holes of the base plate, and each of the multiple kinds of the specific binding substances may be fixed to one of the adsorptive regions in order to form one of the spot-shaped regions. In such cases, the biochemical analysis unit is capable of being provided with the spot-shaped regions located at a high density, and the efficiency with which the analysis is made is capable of being enhanced. Also, when the label signal is formed by use of the biochemical analysis unit having been processed with the specific binding means, the radiation, the fluorescence, or the chemiluminescence produced from the spot-shaped region is capable of being prevented from scattering. Therefore, the occurrence of noise is capable of being suppressed, and good analysis results are capable of being obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> With the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention, wherein the radioactive labeling substance is utilized as the labeling substance and the stimulable phosphor sheet is utilized, the identification information of the biochemical analysis unit and the identification information of the stimulable phosphor sheet are acquired, and the correspondence relationship between the two pieces of the identification information is specified. Therefore, it is capable of being found automatically which radiation information stored on which stimulable phosphor sheet was obtained from which biochemical analysis unit (in other words, which radiation information stored on which stimulable phosphor sheet was obtained with respect to which organism-originating substance). Accordingly, in the biochemical analysis system utilizing the stimulable phosphor sheet, artificial mistakes are capable of being avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> Also, in cases where the identification information of the stimulable phosphor sheet is acquired, the number of times of use of the stimulable phosphor sheet is capable of being counted. Therefore, the management of the scrapping period of the stimulable phosphor sheet, and the like, is capable of being performed easily in accordance with the number of times of use of the stimulable phosphor sheet. Accordingly, the problems are capable of being prevented from occurring in that a deteriorated stimulable phosphor sheet is further used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> Further, the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention may be modified such that the stimulable phosphor sheet comprises the support and the plurality of the dot-shaped stimulable phosphor layer regions, which are located at a spacing from one another on or in the support, and the positions and the sizes of the plurality of the dot-shaped stimulable phosphor layer regions correspond respectively to the positions and the sizes of the spot-shaped regions of the biochemical analysis unit.

Therefore, the radiation radiated out from each of the spot-shaped regions of the biochemical analysis unit impinges upon only the corresponding stimulable phosphor layer region of the stimulable phosphor sheet. Accordingly, the problems are capable of being prevented from occurring in that the radiation radiated out from a certain spot-shaped region of the biochemical analysis unit impinges upon a site on the stimulable phosphor sheet, which site corresponds to a spot-shaped region adjacent to the certain spot-shaped region of the biochemical analysis unit, and noise is thus caused to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> The stimulable phosphor sheet comprising the dot-shaped stimulable phosphor layer regions may be utilized in combination with the biochemical analysis unit, wherein the base plate is made from the material having the radiation attenuating properties and/or the light attenuating properties and has the plurality of the holes, the adsorptive region is formed in each of the plurality of the holes of the base plate, and each of the multiple kinds of the specific binding substances is fixed to one of the adsorptive regions in order to form one of the spot-shaped regions. In such cases, the positions and the sizes of the plurality of the dot-shaped stimulable phosphor layer regions of the stimulable phosphor sheet correspond respectively to the positions and the sizes of the holes of the biochemical analysis unit. Therefore, the occurrence of noise is capable of being prevented even further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> With the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention, wherein the biochemical analysis system further comprises the spotting means for spotting each of the specific binding substances to one of different positions on or in the base plate in order to form the plurality of the spot-shaped regions, and thereby preparing the biochemical analysis unit, the identification information and the spot information of the thus formed biochemical analysis unit are capable of being acquired, and it is capable of being found automatically which specific binding substances have been formed in what location pattern on which biochemical analysis unit. Therefore, in cases where the commercially available biochemical analysis unit is not used and in cases where the biochemical analysis unit having been used for the biochemical analysis is reused, artificial mistakes are capable of being avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> With the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention, wherein the identification information of the biochemical analysis unit contains the identification information of the base plate of the biochemical analysis unit, the number of times of use of the base plate is capable of being found, and the management of the scrapping period of the base plate, and the like, is capable of being performed easily. Therefore, the problems are capable of being prevented from occurring in that a deteriorated base plate is used again and the analysis is thus adversely affected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> With the biochemical analysis unit in accordance with the present invention, the data inherent to the biochemical analysis unit, such as the micro array or the macro array, is capable of being managed reliably, and the reliability of the biochemical analysis is capable of being enhanced markedly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> With the method and the system for managing a biochemical analysis unit in accordance with the present invention, the biochemical analysis unit having been used for the biochemical analysis, in which the organism-originating substance having been labeled with the radioactive labeling substance is subjected to the hybridization with the specific binding substances contained in the biochemical analysis unit, is capable of being managed reliably until the level of the radioactivity of the radioactive labeling substance attenuates to the level equal to at most the predetermined level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> With the method and system for managing a biochemical analysis medium in accordance with the present invention, the biochemical analysis unit having been used for the biochemical analysis, in which the organism-originating substance having been labeled with the radioactive labeling substance is subjected to the hybridization with the specific binding substances contained in the biochemical analysis unit, or the stimulable phosphor sheet having been used for the biochemical analysis, in which the stimulable phosphor layer of the stimulable phosphor sheet is exposed to the radiation radiated out from the radioactive labeling substance, is capable of being managed reliably until the level of the radioactivity of the radioactive labeling substance attenuates to the level equal to at most the predetermined level.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> The present invention will hereinbelow be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an embodiment of the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic perspective view showing a base plate (a membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>) of a biochemical analysis unit utilized in the biochemical analysis system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> utilized in this embodiment of the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention comprises an aluminum metal plate, which has radiation attenuating properties, and a plurality of through-holes <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, . . . which have approximately circular shapes and are formed at a high density in the aluminum metal plate. A porous material <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, such as cellulose acetate, is filled in each of the through holes <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, . . . Also, a bar code <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, which represents information representing an identification (ID) number of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, is attached to a marginal area of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this embodiment of the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention comprises a bar code reader <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> for reading out the bar code <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> attached to the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and acquiring the ID number of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The biochemical analysis system also comprises a spotting apparatus <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> for spotting specific binding substances respectively into the through-holes <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, . . . of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in order to form spots and thereby preparing the biochemical analysis unit. The biochemical analysis system further comprises a bar code reader <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> for reading out the bar code <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of the biochemical analysis unit immediately before the biochemical analysis unit is subjected to hybridization executed by a hybridization apparatus <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, which will be described later, and acquiring the ID number of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, which is to be subjected to the hybridization. The biochemical analysis system still further comprises the hybridization apparatus <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> for applying a sample, which is to be analyzed and has been labeled with a radioactive isotope (RI) acting as a radioactive labeling substance, to the biochemical analysis unit, which has been prepared with the process for spotting the specific binding substances onto the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. With the hybridization apparatus <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, the labeled sample is thus subjected to selective binding (i.e., the hybridization) with the specific binding substances, which constitute the spots of the biochemical analysis unit. As a result of the hybridization, the labeled sample is selectively bound to at least one specific binding substance among the specific binding substances constituting the spots. The biochemical analysis system also comprises an exposure apparatus <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> for executing an exposure operation by superposing a stimulable phosphor sheet (hereinbelow referred to also as the IP sheet) and the biochemical analysis unit, which has been subjected to the hybridization, one upon the other. As a result of the exposure operation, the IP sheet is exposed to radiation radiated out from the radioactive labeling substance, with which the sample having been selectively bound to the at least one specific binding substance, has been labeled. The biochemical analysis system further comprises a bar code reader <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> for reading out a bar code attached to the IP sheet to be subjected to the exposure operation, and the bar code <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of the biochemical analysis unit to be fed into the exposure apparatus <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, and thereby acquiring the ID number of the IP sheet and the ID number of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of the biochemical analysis unit, which are to be superposed one upon the other. The biochemical analysis system still further comprises a detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> provided with a bar code reader <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> for reading out the bar code of the IP sheet, which has been subjected to the exposure operation executed by the exposure apparatus <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, and thereby acquiring the ID number of the exposed IP sheet. In the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, stimulating rays, which cause the IP sheet to emit light in proportion to the amount of energy stored on the IP sheet during the exposure of the IP sheet to the radiation, are irradiated to the IP sheet, and the light emitted by the IP sheet is photoelectrically detected. In this manner, data for a biochemical analysis is formed. The biochemical analysis system also comprises a data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. The data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> sends information representing spotting conditions to the spotting apparatus <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, sends information representing hybridizing conditions to the hybridization apparatus <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, sends information representing exposing conditions to the exposure apparatus <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, and sends information representing detecting conditions to the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. Also, the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> receives the ID information from each of the bar code readers <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>, receives spot information from the spotting apparatus <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, receives the ID information of the sample from the hybridization apparatus <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, and receives data from the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. The data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> stores the received pieces of information such that correspondence relationships among the received pieces of information are clear. Further, the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> performs data analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> How this embodiment of the biochemical analysis system operates will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> When the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> having the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is fed into the spotting process, the bar code reader <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> for the spotting process reads out the bar code <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and acquires the ID number of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, in accordance with the spotting conditions (i.e., the positions of the spots, the kinds of the specific binding substances, and the like), which have been received from the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, the spotting apparatus <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> spots the specific binding substances respectively into the plurality of the through-holes <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, . . . of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and thereby prepares the biochemical analysis unit. At the same time, the ID number and the spot information (in this case, the information representing the spotting conditions) of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of the biochemical analysis unit are sent to the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> The data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> stores the membrane ID number, which has been received from the bar code reader <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and the spot information, which has been received from the spotting apparatus <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, in a storage section (not shown), such that it is clear which spot information corresponds to which membrane ID number. The membrane ID number and the corresponding spot information are utilized in the analysis, which will be performed later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> The biochemical analysis unit, which has been prepared with the spotting process performed by the spotting apparatus <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, is fed into the hybridizing process. Before the biochemical analysis unit is subjected to the hybridization with the hybridization apparatus <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, the bar code reader <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> for the hybridizing process reads out the bar code <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of the biochemical analysis unit and acquires the membrane ID number. Thereafter, the biochemical analysis unit is subjected to the hybridization executed by the hybridization apparatus <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The hybridization is executed in accordance with the hybridizing conditions (i.e., the ID number of the sample subjected to the hybridization, the time of hybridization, and the like) having been received from the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. As a result of the hybridization, at least one spot among the plurality of the spots of the biochemical analysis unit is selectively labeled with the RI-labeled sample. At the same time, the membrane ID number of the biochemical analysis unit and the sample ID number are sent to the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the membrane ID number, which has been received from the bar code reader <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> stores the sample ID number, which has been received from the hybridization apparatus <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, in the storage section (not shown) such that it is clear which sample ID number corresponds to which spot information among the pieces of spot information having already been stored in association with membrane ID numbers. The sample ID number and the corresponding spot information are utilized in the analysis, which will be performed later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> The biochemical analysis unit, which has been subjected to the hybridization executed by the hybridization apparatus <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, is then fed into the exposing process. Before the biochemical analysis unit and the IP sheet are superposed one upon the other in the exposure apparatus <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, the bar code reader <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> for the exposing process reads out the bar code <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of the biochemical analysis unit and the bar code of the IP sheet to be superposed upon the biochemical analysis unit and thereby acquires the membrane ID number and the IP sheet ID number. The information representing the membrane ID number and the information representing the IP sheet ID number are sent from the bar code reader <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> to the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the exposure apparatus <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> executes the exposure operation by superposing the biochemical analysis unit and the IP sheet one upon the other in accordance with the exposing conditions (i.e., the time of exposure, and the like), which have been received from the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the membrane ID number, which has been received from the bar code reader <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> stores the IP sheet ID number, which has been received from the bar code reader <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, in the storage section (not shown) such that it is clear which IP sheet ID number corresponds to which spot information and which sample ID number among the pieces of information having already been stored in association with the membrane ID numbers. The IP sheet ID number, the corresponding spot information, and the corresponding sample ID number are utilized in the analysis, which will be performed later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> The IP sheet, which has been subjected to the exposure operation, is then fed into the detecting process. Firstly, the bar code reader <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> of the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> reads out the bar code of the IP sheet to be fed into the detecting process and acquires the IP sheet ID number. Thereafter, the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> irradiates the stimulating rays to the IP sheet and photoelectrically detects the light emitted by the IP sheet. In this manner, digital data is obtained. The digital data is sent to the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> together with the IP sheet ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the IP sheet ID number, which has been received from the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> stores the digital data, which has been received from the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, in the storage section (not shown) such that it is clear which digital data corresponds to which membrane ID number, which spot information, and which sample ID number among the pieces of information having already been stored in association with the IP sheet ID numbers. The digital data is utilized in the analysis, which will be performed later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> The biochemical analysis unit, which has been used in the exposure operation for the IP sheet, may be washed. The washed biochemical analysis unit is capable of being reused for the biochemical analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a format, in which the digital data, the spot information, and ID numbers are stored in the storage section of the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, with respect to a single piece of digital data, the membrane ID number of the membrane having been used for acquiring the digital data, the spot information at the time of the preparation of the biochemical analysis unit by use of the membrane, the sample ID number of the sample having been used at the time of the hybridization utilizing the biochemical analysis unit, and the IP sheet ID number of the IP sheet having been subjected to the exposure operation utilizing the biochemical analysis unit, which has been subjected to the hybridization, are stored such that the correspondence relationships among the pieces of information are clear. In this embodiment, in the storage section (not shown) of the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, information representing the hole location pattern of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> has been inputted and stored previously in accordance with the membrane ID number, and sample specifying information has been inputted and stored previously in accordance with the sample ID number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> When the analysis is later performed on the digital, data, the data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> acquires the hole location pattern information of the membrane in accordance with the membrane ID number, which has been stored in association with the digital data. The data analyzing and control section <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> also acquires the sample specifying information corresponding to the sample ID number. In this manner, the analysis of the digital data is capable of being made in accordance with the hole location pattern information, the sample specifying information, and the spot information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment of the biochemical analysis system, the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> is provided with the bar code reader <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>, and the correspondence relationship between the digital data and the IP sheet ID number is made clear. Alternatively, in cases where the exposure apparatus <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> are located at positions comparatively close to each other, and the IP sheets having been subjected to the exposure operations executed by the exposure apparatus <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> are fed into the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> in the order, in which the IP sheets are subjected to the exposure operations, the bar code reader <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> of the detection apparatus <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may be omitted. Also, in such cases, the order, in which the IP sheets are subjected to the exposure operations, and order, in which pieces of digital data are detected, may be collated with each other, and the correspondence relationship between the digital data and the IP sheet ID number may thereby be specified. In this manner, the biochemical analysis system may be kept simple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> Also, in this embodiment of the biochemical analysis system, the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> having the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is employed. With the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the spots are capable of being formed at a high density in the biochemical analysis unit, and the problems are capable of being prevented from occurring in that the electron rays, which have been radiated out from the radioactive labeling substance contained in at least one of the spots, are scattered within the membrane during the exposure operation performed by use of the biochemical analysis unit having been subjected to the hybridization and the IP sheet, and that the electron rays, which have been radiated out from the radioactive labeling substance contained in one of the spots, are scattered and impinge upon a region of the IP sheet, which region is to be exposed to the electron rays radiated out from an adjacent spot. However, in the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention, the membrane is not limited to the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> having the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> Further, in this embodiment of the biochemical analysis system, the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> having the through-holes is employed, such that the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is capable of being reused easily through the washing and the biochemical analysis unit is capable of being prepared easily from the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a membrane comprising a base plate, a plurality of holes, which are other than the through-holes and are formed in the base plate, and an adsorptive material, which has been filled in each of the recesses of the holes, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in this embodiment of the biochemical analysis system, aluminum is employed as the material for the formation of the base plate. However, in cases where the radioactive labeling substance is employed as the labeling substance, the material for the formation of the base plate may be selected from a wide variety of materials having the radiation attenuating properties. The material for the formation of the base plate should preferably be selected from metal materials, ceramic materials, and plastic materials. Also, the material for the formation of the base plate may be selected from inorganic compound materials and organic compound materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> Also, as the stimulable phosphor sheet (i.e., the IP sheet), a stimulable phosphor sheet comprising a support and dot-shaped stimulable phosphor layer regions, which are located at a spacing from one another on or in the support, may be employed. In such cases, the problems are capable of being prevented from occurring in that the radiation having been radiated out from the biochemical analysis unit is scattered within the stimulable phosphor sheet. Therefore, the occurrence of noise is capable of being suppressed even further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> As described above, with this embodiment of the biochemical analysis system, in the spotting process, the membrane ID number and the spot information are acquired such that the correspondence relationship between the two pieces of information is clear. Also, in the hybridizing process, the membrane ID number and the sample ID number are acquired such that the correspondence relationship between the two pieces of information is clear. Further, in the exposing process, the membrane ID number and the IP sheet ID number are acquired such that the correspondence relationship between the two pieces of information is clear. Therefore, without reliance upon memory of the operator, a memorandum made by the operator, or the like, being made, it is capable of being found accurately and automatically, for example, which data was acquired by use of which biochemical analysis unit (i.e., which membrane) and which sample. Accordingly, artificial mistakes are capable of being avoided, and correct results of analysis are capable of being obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> Also, with this embodiment of the biochemical analysis system, in cases where the identification information (i.e., the IP sheet ID number) of the stimulable phosphor sheet is acquired, the number of times of use of the stimulable phosphor sheet is capable of being counted. Therefore, the management of the scrapping period of the stimulable phosphor sheet, and the like, is capable of being performed easily in accordance with the number of times of use of the stimulable phosphor sheet. Accordingly, the problems are capable of being prevented from occurring in that a deteriorated stimulable phosphor sheet is further used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0407&rsqb;</number> Further, this embodiment of the biochemical analysis system is provided with the spotting apparatus <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, such that a membrane, on which the spots have not yet been formed, may be utilized, and such that a membrane having already been used for the biochemical analysis may be reused. Also, the membrane ID number and the spot information are stored such that the correspondence relationship between the two pieces of information is clear. Therefore, it is capable of being found automatically which specific binding substances have been formed in what location pattern on which biochemical analysis unit. Accordingly, in cases where the commercially available biochemical analysis unit is not used and in cases where the biochemical analysis unit having been used for the biochemical analysis is reused, artificial mistakes are capable of being avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of the biochemical analysis system is provided with the spotting apparatus <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, such that a membrane, on which the spots have not yet been formed, may be utilized, and such that a membrane having already been used for the biochemical analysis may be reused. Also, the membrane ID number, which has been acquired by reading out the bar code of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> by use of the bar code reader <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the spotting process, is taken as the identification information of the biochemical analysis unit having been prepared by use of the membrane <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. However, in cases where a commercially available biochemical analysis unit having already been provided with the spots is utilized, the biochemical analysis system may be constituted such that the system is not provided with the spotting apparatus <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the bar code reader <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and the bar code reader <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> are located respectively for the hybridizing process and the exposing process, and the ID number of the biochemical analysis unit is acquired such that it is clear which ID number of the biochemical analysis unit corresponds to which sample ID number and which IP sheet ID number. With the thus constituted biochemical analysis system, as in the embodiment of the biochemical analysis system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, without reliance upon memory of the operator, a memorandum made by the operator, or the like, being made, it is capable of being found accurately and automatically, for example, which data was acquired by use of which biochemical analysis unit and which sample. Accordingly, artificial mistakes are capable of being avoided, and correct results of analysis are capable of being obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> Also, with the aforesaid embodiment of the biochemical analysis system, the membrane ID number is taken as the identification information of the biochemical analysis unit. Therefore, the number of times of use of the membrane is capable of being counted, and the management of the scrapping period of the base plate, and the like, is capable of being performed easily. Accordingly, the problems are capable of being prevented from occurring in that a deteriorated base plate is further used and the results of the analysis are adversely affected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0410&rsqb;</number> In the aforesaid embodiment of the biochemical analysis system, the radioactive labeling substance (i.e., the RI) is employed as the labeling substance, the exposure operation is executed by superposing the biochemical analysis unit having been subjected to the hybridization and the IP sheet one upon the other, and the data for a biochemical analysis is acquired by detecting the information from the IP sheet. However, the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention is not limited to the use of the radioactive labeling substance as the labeling substance. For example, the biochemical analysis system in accordance with the present invention is also applicable to biochemical analysis systems, wherein the fluorescent labeling substance described above or the labeling substance described above, which is capable of producing the chemiluminescence when being brought into contact with a chemiluminescence substrate, may be employed as the labeling substance, and the system is provided with the label signal forming means and the read-out means corresponding to the kind of the labeling substance. </paragraph>
