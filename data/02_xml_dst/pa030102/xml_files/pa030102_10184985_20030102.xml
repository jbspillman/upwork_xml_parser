<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical module and, more particularly, to an optical module capable of stably transmitting an optical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An optical module is an optical device to be used in an optical communication and, more specifically, an assembly in which an optical fiber or an optical waveguide is aligned with respect to the optical axis of an optical device (light emitting device or light receiving device) and connected thereto. In the optical module, an electrical signal is converted into an optical signal to be transmitted to the optical fiber or an optical waveguide, or an optical signal received from the optical fiber or the optical waveguide is converted into an electric signal to be transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An optical fiber is formed of a slender single wire or a bundle of wires of glass or synthetic resin. An optical fiber made of glass is formed to a thickness of 3&tilde;60 &mgr;m and an optical fiber made of synthetic resin is formed to a thickness of 100 &mgr;m&tilde;10 mm. Also, an optical fiber is composed of a core, which has a high refractive index and is formed on a central portion of the optical fiber, and a clad, which has a low refractive index and is formed on an outer portion of the optical fiber. A light, which is incident on an optical fiber, is totally reflected from an interface between the core and the clad and is propagated only to the core. The optical fiber is a light communication path in which a relay interval can be lengthened while a loss in light is minimized; the optical fiber is used in the optical communication as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The optical waveguide is included in a housing in which the optical fiber is made of silicon or polymer, and is used mainly for transmitting an optical signal over a short distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For instance, in a conventional optical module disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,434,939, an optical fiber is inserted into a guiding hole, which is formed to face a surface emitting laser in a substrate having the surface emitting laser, and fixed by an adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a structure of a conventional optical module. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the optical module includes: an electric circuit substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>; a light emitting chip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> installed on the electric circuit substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and including first and second layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B; a surface emitting laser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which has a p-type mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an active layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an n-type mirror <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and which is installed in the first layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the light emitting chip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and electrically connected to the electric circuit substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>; an open guiding hole <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> aligned with respect to the surface emitting laser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and formed in the second layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the light emitting chip <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, i.e. the second layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B comprises a semiconductor substrate; and an optical fiber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> optically connected to the surface emitting laser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and inserted into the guiding hole <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The voltage of the surface emitting laser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is amplified by a bipolar transistor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> installed at a lower portion thereof, comprising a collector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and an emitter <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The amplified voltage is transmitted to the surface emitting laser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a laser beam is emitted in the surface emitting laser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As a result, an optical signal is generated and travels toward the optical fiber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, in the above conventional optical module, an adhesive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> used to fasten the optical fiber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the guiding hole <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may leak in the guiding hole <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. If this happens, an optical signal generated from the surface emitting laser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be blocked from transmission to the optical fiber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by the adhesive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Further, when the optical fiber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not firmly fastened in the guiding hole <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the position of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will change, thereby preventing an optical signal from being entirely transmitted to the optical fiber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the surface emitting laser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In addition, the conventional optical module is configured in that the guiding hole <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is installed in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, which requires an additional manufacturing process. Accordingly, the conventional optical module is difficult to make and manufacture. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described in detail by describing illustrative, non-limiting embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, the same reference characters denote the same elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> show an optical module according to the first illustrative, non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, which includes: an optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for converting an optical signal into an electric signal, and vice versa; a light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which is a path to which an optical signal is transmitted by the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>; and a holder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> formed on an end of the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to fix the optical axes of the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of which optical axes are aligned with respect to the same point, and through which an optical signal is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> includes a core <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, which has a high refractive index and is a path through which the optical signal is transmitted, and a clad <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, which has a low refractive index and is formed outside the core <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. An optical signal is reflected from an interface between the core <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the clad <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Also, this optical module further includes a substrate <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to contact the holder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, in which the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> First through sixth terminals <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f, </italic></highlight>which are paths of an electric signal, are installed on the substrate <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which is a light emitting and light receiving device. Also, a wire <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is connected to the terminals <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f, </italic></highlight>through which an electric signal is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> An electric signal supplied from the terminals <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is converted into an optical signal in the light emitting device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and then transmitted to the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The optical signal transmitted to the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> passes through the core <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> included in the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and is transmitted to the light receiving device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> facing one side of the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The optical signal incident upon the light-receiving device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is converted into an electric signal and transmitted to the terminals <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Although a portion of the holder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is interposed between the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the holder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is formed of a medium having optical transmittance of 90% or more, and further, a distance between the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is very short. Accordingly, an optical signal transmitted to the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can almost entirely be transmitted to the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The light emitting device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may, for example, comprise a laser diode (LD), a liquid emitting diode (LED), a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) and so on, and converts an electric signal into an optical signal and transmits the converted signal. The light-receiving device may, for example, comprise an avalanche photo diode (APD), a PIN photo diode and so on, and receives an optical signal and converts it into an electric signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The first and second terminals <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed on the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The third and fourth terminals <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>which are formed around the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, are electrically connected to the first and second terminals <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by the wire <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, respectively. Also, the fifth and sixth terminals <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f, </italic></highlight>which are formed on a lower portion of the substrate <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, are electrically connected to the third and fourth terminals <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> An optical fiber or an optical waveguide may be used as the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is used to transmit an information signal or an image signal or an optical power. An optical fiber and an optical waveguide are mainly used in a long-distance optical communication and in a short-distance optical communication, e.g. within a distance of 10 cm, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The holder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is a means for connecting the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as described above, and is formed of a medium with a light transmittance to deliver an optical signal transmitted from the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. PMMA, poly-perfluorinated butenylvinylether and epoxy, which are generally used in manufacturing an optical lens, can be used as a medium having the light transmittance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The holder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is fused to be attached to the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. To stably transmit an optical signal, the optical axes of the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> must be aligned with respect to the same point in the holder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. After the alignment, the fused holder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is hardened to fix the optical device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the light guide member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
