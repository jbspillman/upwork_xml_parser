<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An oil mist eliminator includes an impeller rotating about its axis in one direction within a casing having an inlet and an outlet. The impeller includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced blades held between front and rear discs. The front disc has a center opening for introducing an oil-contaminated air. Each blade is composed of an inner fin extending in a radial direction and an outer fin bent from the inner fin for deflecting the air proceeding between the adjacent inner fins in a forward direction, thereby creating a forced air flow for introducing the air axially from the front opening, guiding it radially between the discs, and venting it axially forwardly in a front-in and front-out fashion. Thus, even a portion of the air being guided immediately along the rear disc can be successfully deflected for collision against the outer fins without fail, maximizing oil separation efficiency. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,207,809 discloses an oil mist eliminator using an impeller or fan for separating the oil mist from an oil-contaminated air while changing flow directions. The oil eliminator includes a casing with an inlet and an outlet, and an impeller which is accommodated within the casing and is driven to rotate about a rotation axis of the impeller for drawing the contaminated air from the inlet and discharge a clean air removed of the oil mist out through the outlet. The impeller is of a front-in and rear-out type which draws the air from a front opening of the impeller and vents the clear air rearwards with respect to the rotation axis. In detail, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> of the attached drawings, the impeller is composed of a front disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>P with a center opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>P, a rear disc <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>P coaxial with the front disc, and a plurality of blades <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>X which are circumferentially spaced and secured between the front and rear discs. The rear disc <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>P is provided with a hub <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>P receiving a motor output shaft for rotating the impeller in one direction. Each blade <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>P is shaped into a generally L-shaped with an inner fin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>P extending radially between the front and rear discs and an outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>P which is bent from an inner fin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>P towards the rotating direction. The outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>P projects radially outwardly of the discs to deflect a radial air flow guided between adjacent inner fins <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>P so as to deposit the oil mist on the outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>P by collision of the oil-laden air against the outer fin, while permitting the air flow in the deflected direction. The outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>P is twisted so as to deflect the air axially rearward for discharging the air out through the outlet. With this arrangement, however, there remains a problem that the air (indicated by arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) drawn through the center opening and guided radially outwardly adjacent along the rear disc <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>P may partially escape rearwards past the outer circumference of the rear disc without colliding against the outer fin, i.e., without a chance of separating the oil mist from the air. Thus, the oil mist may be still carried on the air being discharged out through the outlet, thereby lowering separation efficiency. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVNETION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In view of the above insufficiency, the present invention has been accomplished to provide an oil mist eliminator which is capable of separating the oil mist successfully and efficiently. The oil mist eliminator in accordance with the present invention includes a casing with an inlet and an outlet, and an impeller which is accommodated within the casing and is driven to rotate about a rotation axis for drawing an oil-contaminated air through the inlet and discharging a clean air removed of the oil mist out through the outlet. The impeller is composed of a rear disc provided at its center with a hub for receiving a rotating shaft in registration with the rotation axis, a front disc spaced forwardly of the rear disc in a coaxial relation thereto. The front disc has a center front opening in registration with the inlet for drawing the contaminated air. The impeller includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced blades which are secured between the rear disc and the front disc. Each of the blades is of a generally L-shaped configuration having an inner fin extending generally in a radial direction of the impeller and an outer fin which is bent from the inner fin in a rotating direction of the impeller. The outer fin projects radially outwardly of the rear and front discs to deflect a radial air flow proceeding between the adjacent inner fins so as to deposit the oil mist or the oil particles upon the outer fin by collision against the outer fin, while permitting the clean air removed of the oil mist to flow in a deflected direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The characterizing feature of the present invention resides in that the outer fin is twisted with respect to a tangential direction on the circumference of the impeller in a forward direction along the rotation axis such that the outer fin has its inside surface facing in the forward direction, thereby directing the clean air axially forwardly to discharge the same out through the outlet. Thus, the impeller is configured to be of a front-in and front-out type which draws the contaminated air from the front opening and deflect the clean air back in the axially forward direction. With this structure, the contaminated air proceeding axially through the center opening and then being guided radially along the rear disc can be successfully directed towards the outer fin and merge into the axially forward air flow being discharged out from the impeller, thereby minimizing a chance of the air flow partially escaping through the circumference of the impeller without colliding against the outer fin and therefore improving separation efficiency of depositing the oils mist on the outer fin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a bent line along which the outer fin is bent from the inner fin is inclined with respect to the rotation axis such that bent line has a radial distance from said rotation axis which is greater towards its front end than at its rear end. This is advantageous in that the outer fin can have the inside air deflecting surface of increased area within a limited axial dimension between the rear and front discs. In this connection, the outer fin may be shaped to have its front end projecting forwardly beyond a plane of the front disc to give an increased surface area to the inside surface responsible for diverting the air flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, the width of the outer fin defined between the bent line and an outer circumferential edge of the outer fin may be made greater towards the front end of the outer fin than at the rear end thereof, for efficiently producing the air flow back in the axially forward direction with an attendant enhancement of oil separation efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The front disc may be additionally shaped to have its outer periphery bent rearwards to form thereat a baffler rim which is inclined with respect to the front disc in order to impede the air flow proceeding radially along the front disc from escaping out through the impeller without colliding against the outer fin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These and still other objects and advantageous features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiment when taken in conjunction with the attached drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, there is shown an oil recovery system incorporating an oil mist eliminator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The system is adapted to be installed in a machine factory where lathes or the like cutting tools are running with an attendant creation of an oil mist, i.e., tiny oil particles spread in the atmosphere, in order to separate the oil particles from the atmosphere and collect thus separated oils for realizing a clean room environment. The system includes a housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having a center chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for mounting therein the oil mist eliminator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which generates a forded air flow from an intake port <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to an exhaust port <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> further includes a pre-treatment chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> upstream of the eliminator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for collecting the oil-contaminated air, a silencing room <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> downstream of the eliminator for muffling a sound of driving the eliminator and at the same time filtering out minute oil particles possibly carried on the air from the eliminator. An oil pan <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is detachably mounted at the bottom of the housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to collect the oil particles recovered at the eliminator and the chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The pre-treatment chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is provided with an agglomerator <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a filter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The agglomerator <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes a row of L-shaped baffles <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> disposed in the course of the air flow from the intake port <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to the eliminator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for collecting the oil particles of a relatively large diameter. The collected oil particles are dripped from the baffles and are drained through a drain port <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> into the oil pan <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. It is noted here that the intake port <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is located at the upper end of the chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to direct an intake air flow towards the eliminator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> partly after colliding a bottom of the chamber, as indicated by arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> so as to deposit the oil particles also on the bottom of the chamber. Thus deposited oil particles are led to the oil pan <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> also through the drain port <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The filter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is disposed adjacent to the agglomerator <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> for filtering out dust or the like foreign matters from the air prior to the air entering the eliminator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The silencing room <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is also provided with a cylindrical filter <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for filtering out the oil particles not captured by the eliminator to release the clean air out through the exhaust port <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The eliminator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a casing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fitted within the center chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and provided with an inlet duct <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for introduction of the air from the pre-treatment chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to an inlet <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the eliminator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The eliminator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an impeller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is driven by a motor to rotate in one direction for drawing the contaminated air and delivering a clean air removed of the oil mist through an outlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provided in an upper part of the casing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The outlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> communicates through the silencing room <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> so that the clean air is exhausted out through the exhaust port <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the silencing room <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As best shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the impeller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a front disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a center opening which defines the inlet <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the impeller, a rear disc <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with a hub <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> receiving an rotating shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the motor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a plurality of generally L-shaped blades <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> spaced circumferentially around the discs. The blades <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are secured between the circumferences of the discs to assemble the impeller of a unitary structure in which the front and rear discs are held parallel and coaxially arranged about a rotating axis corresponding to an axis of the rotating shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Each blade <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is composed of an outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> bent from an inner fin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> along a bent line <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The inner fins <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> extend generally radially between the discs in a somewhat curved fashion to give radial flow paths between the adjacent inner fins <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Each outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is bent along the bent line <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in the rotating direction (R) of the impeller, and projects outwardly from the discs, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Further, the outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is twisted relative to the inner fin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> with respect to a tangential direction on the circumference of the impeller so that the outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> has its inside surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> facing forwardly in the axial direction. Thus, the outer fins <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> deflect the air proceeding through the radial flow paths toward the axially forwardly as the impeller rotates. That is, the impeller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is configured to be of a front-in and front-out type in which the air is drawn from the front center opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, then guided along the radial paths, and returned axially forwardly as being deflected by the outer fins <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> so as to be vented out through the outlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The oil particles carried on the air being introduced in the impeller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are deposited largely on the outer fins <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> as the air flow is caused to change its flow direction at the outer fins. The oil particles thus deposited on the fins are flung outwardly by a centrifugal force acting thereon and are accumulated on the bottom of the casing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from which they are recovered through a drain port <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into the oil pan <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The clean air removed of the oil particles is forced to flow out through the outlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Since the outer fins <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is responsible for deflecting the radial air flow axially forwardly and therefore creating a forced air flow out from the impeller in the axially forward direction, as indicated by arrows shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, even the radially outward air flow proceeding immediately along the rear disc <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is caused to merge successfully into the forced air flow directed in the axially forward direction, thereby being prevented from escaping axially rearward of the rear disc <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> without colliding against the outer fins <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Thus, the oil particles carried on the air flow proceeding immediately along the rear disc <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be successfully separated by collision against the outer fins, giving improved oil separation efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the bent line <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is inclined with respect to the rotation axis of the impeller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such that the bent line has a radial distance from the rotation axis which is greater towards its front end <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> than at a rear end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. With this arrangement, the upper fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is given the inside surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of an increased surface area within a limited axial spacing between the discs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, improving air flow generating capacity as well as the oil separation efficiency. For the same purpose, the outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is shaped to have a width which is greater towards the front end <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> than at the rear end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The width is defined between the bent line <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and an outer circumferential edge of the outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. It is noted in this connection, the bent line <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is coincidence with the outer edge of the rear disc <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at the rear end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and is spaced radially outwardly at the front end <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the fin from the outer edge of the front disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which has a larger diameter than the rear disc <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In order to further enhance the air flow generating capacity as well as the oil separation efficiency, the impeller may be modified, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, to give an increased surface area to the outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A by projecting the front end <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A of the outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A together with an adjacent portion of the inner fin <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>A. In addition, the front disc may have its outer periphery bent rearward to form thereat a baffer rim <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which is inclined with respect to the front disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A in order to impede the air flow, especially proceeding along the front disc, from escaping out through the impeller without colliding against the outer fin <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A. Like parts are designated by like reference numerals with a suffix letter of &ldquo;A&rdquo; for an easy reference purpose. </paragraph>
